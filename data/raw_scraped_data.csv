'People won’t have it': Backlash erupts over RBA governor Michele Bullock's claim cash will be gone in about 10 years,James Harrison,https://www.skynews.com.au/business/finance/people-wont-have-it-backlash-erupts-over-rba-governor-michele-bullocks-claim-cash-will-be-gone-in-about-10-years/news-story/9ef8357ae2836bb71aa61f29d64f3d79,"A cash advocate has torn into comments from the Reserve Bank of Australia’s Governor Michele Bullock, who predicted Aussies would not be using cash in about 10 years.
The head of the RBA on Friday fronted a parliamentary inquiry, where she gave her forecast on cash as Aussies increasingly look to digital methods for making payments.
“Cash is not making a rebound. I don’t think anything is going to turn it around. It is on a long-term decline because people find making electronic payments much more efficient,” Ms Bullock said.
She added: ""We’ve got to think that cash is going to be around probably for another 10 years, and we’ve got to find a way of moving to a new system that means that distribution of cash can be undertaken and viable.”
Her comment sparked backlash from Cash Welcome founder Jason Bryce, who declared a cashless society would never happen.
“I think there will never be a cashless society in Australia or anywhere else because people won't have it,” Mr Bryce told SkyNews.com.au.
He also questioned the timeline Ms Bullock gave and warned a replacement for the physical payment may not be “viable”.
“Michelle Bullock was wrong to talk about the demise of cash in a 10-year time span because there's no viable replacement for cash that's trusted by everybody, that's private and 100 per cent reliable,” Mr Bryce said.
“Until that happens, we really can't be talking about cash.
“I don't believe cash will ever disappear.”
He also doubted the level of trust people give to digital deposits in their bank compared to the cash they physically interact with.
“The money in the bank in my name is not actually owned by me. All I own is a debt from the bank to me,” Mr Bryce said.
“It's a liability on the bank's balance sheet. If there's no cash there's no one hundred percent guarantee that I have any money.
“So I'm very concerned about Michelle Bullock floating this idea because there's no viable alternative to cash.”
Figures from the RBA, published in 2022, showed that 13 per cent of payments were made with cash.
Digital payments made up a much larger proportion of transactions, with debit cards making up 51 per cent while credit cards were at 26 per cent.
Mr Bryce acknowledged this disparity before going after merchant fees, which have been the subject of much debate recently as Labor vowed to scrap the payments.
“Yes there's a smaller percentage of the number of transactions that are being made in Australia that are cash,” he said.
“The population keeps increasing and there's always a convenient payment new payment system - Tap and Go, EFTPOS, whatever.
“Merchant fees aren't coming down as the number of card transactions are going up and we need a surcharge free option at the point of sale in order to put some competitive pressure on the banks.”
While Mr Bryce was adamant that Australia would never go cashless, Alex Belli, a senior lecturer at the University of Melbourne, told SkyNews.com.au there were ""several factors"" suggesting this transition was ""inevitable"".
He pointed to a rise in eCommerce and the proliferation of digital payment methods in the ""last 15 or so years"", alongside fewer ATMs across the country which made cash less available.
""Taken together, these factors have contributed to the decline of cash transactions to 16 per cent in the last few years,"" Mr Belli said.
Though he agreed with Ms Bullock's timeframe for Australia to go cashless, he also noted there could be ""several issues"" with a cashless society.
""While cashless and digital payments are easier to trace than cash, they can also expose consumers to a higher risk of hacking and identity theft, ultimately increasing the likelihood of illicit activities,"" Mr Belli said.
""In addition, research shows that paying by cashless methods increases consumers' expenditures, a phenomenon known as the ""cashless effect'.""
Meanwhile, Commonwealth Bank's chief executive Matt Comyn on Tuesday vowed to keep cash in circulation for its millions of Australian customers.
""While your banking preferences may continue to change, we know that cash is critical to our customers, the community and to CommBank – and it's here to stay,"" he said.
""We'll continue to distribute more than $4 billion in cash each month through Australia's largest branch and ATM network, which will also benefit from $100 million in upgrades in 2025.""
During her time in front of the parliamentary inquiry, Ms Bullock also revealed low-income renters were the cohort hardest hit by tough cost of living pressures that have plagued Aussies for over a year.
“That would be, I think, the group that is often forgotten. I just want to make sure that people understand they are people that have really been hurt very hard by this,” she said.
“They’ve seen a massive increase in rents and they’ve also experienced massive inflation.""",SKY News,finance
RBA reveals new $5 note will recognise 'connection First Nations people have to country' after deciding not to honour the British monarch on the bill,Sumaiya Chowdhure,https://www.skynews.com.au/business/finance/rba-reveals-new-5-note-will-recognise-connection-first-nations-people-have-to-country-after-deciding-not-to-honour-the-british-monarch-on-the-bill/news-story/7190fdfee4ab570ad1c0dea7f5c61a8a,"Australia's new $5 note will recognise Indigenous peoples' culture, history and contribution to the country, the RBA has announced after deciding not to feature a portrait of the new monarch King Charles III on the bill.
On Monday, the Reserve Bank announced its plans for the updated $5 note to honour the ""enduring emotional, spiritual and physical connection of First Nations peoples to country"".
The new design will replace the portrait of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II with an artwork created by an Indigenous artist, while the reverse side of the note will continue to feature the Australian Parliament.
""For Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, Country is more than just the land. Country is the land, the waters, and the sky. All are connected,"" the RBA said in a statement.
The concept selection follows more than 2,100 design submissions from the public.
Before selecting the theme, the RBA engaged with First Nations organisations across the country to build awareness and encourage the submission of ideas.
""This inspiring theme will guide the creation of an artwork that will feature on the redesigned banknote,"" Assistant Governor of Business Services Michelle McPhee said.
But the changes have drawn criticism from some Australians including Alexander Voltz, a spokesperson for the Australian Monarchist League, who said the new fiver “reflects a broader attack by today’s Republican Labor Party on the Crown, as well as Australia’s history and culture”.
“The changes in design to the $5 note remain merely in the wake of the Albanese Government’s now-failed Voice to Parliament referendum. It was Jim Chalmers… who umpired the decision…” Mr Voltz told The Australian.
The reigning monarch has featured on Australia's banknotes since 1923, with Queen Elizabeth on the $5 note since 1992.
In 2023, the RBA announced it will not replace Queen Elizabeth’s portrait on the $5 note with her son King Charles III, but it would instead honour the First Nations people's ties to the country.
“The bank will consult First Australians in designing the $5 banknote. The new banknote will take a number of years to be designed and printed,” the Reserve Bank said in a statement.
It is understood the RBA also consulted the federal government before making its decision, and had its support.",SKY News,finance
"Middle-income Aussies hardest hit by bracket creep, H&R Block's Mark Chapman reveals, as major parties urged to take action",James Harrison,https://www.skynews.com.au/business/finance/middleincome-aussies-hardest-hit-by-bracket-creep-hr-blocks-mark-chapman-reveals-as-major-parties-urged-to-take-action/news-story/a2287e4be93d107ee00dd5d169d49bc6,"A leading economist has revealed the group of Australians hardest hit by the government’s “stealth tax rise” which takes more from households without actually hiking the tax rate.
Both sides of politics have been urged to take action on bracket creep, where inflation and corresponding wage increases push workers into higher tax brackets, in the lead up to the election.
Bracket creep forces income earners to pay more in tax despite their real take home salary remaining relatively unchanged.
Mark Chapman, the director of tax communications at H&R Block, said this was taking its toll on Aussie taxpayers.
“We've been talking about bracket creep for years and it's been favoured by both governments as effectively a form of stealth tax rise,” he told SkyNews.com.au.
“If you keep the tax thresholds the same, people's earnings increase and therefore they creep up into the next tax bracket.”
He said many taxpayers would not notice this and governments of either political persuasion could get away with it.
Asked which group of Australians would be hardest hit by these “stealthy” increases as millions still struggle with the cost of living crisis, Mr Chapman said it was “middle-income taxpayers”.
“People who are earning between $70,000-$130,000 because if they get a decent pay rise this year, there's a fair chance that they'll move up a tax bracket and end up paying an additional amount of income tax at a higher tax rate,” he said.
“So they tend to be the most commonly affected.”
Every dollar an Australian resident earns between $135,000 and $190,000 is taxed at 37 per cent under Labor’s stage three tax cuts, while income between $45,000 to $135,000 is taxed at 30 per cent.
Labor also increased the threshold for the 37 per cent tax bracket by $15,000 under its revised cuts.
This is a change from the original plan for stage three tax cuts, which would have taxed income between $45,000 to $200,000 at 30 per cent.
While the government's changes did have some impact on bracket creep, other nations use indexation to address the issue by ensuring brackets automatically shift in line with inflation and wage growth.
Canada indexes its tax brackets every year to account for inflation, increasing the rate from 15 per cent for every dollar earned up to $55,867 to $57,375.
Mr Chapman said the indexation solution to bracket creep was a “very compelling one” and added he did not “understand why that is not a preferred solution”.
He also said an income tax cut would be a “very attractive proposal” to either party in the lead up to an election, but stressed this is a “short term fix”.
“As long as the thresholds still remain the same, there'll still be bracket creep, but it'll be at a lower rate of taxation,” Mr Chapman said.
“I don't really see that any party is prepared to go for automatic indexation of the thresholds because that would basically remove their ability to eventually stealthily increase the rate of tax.”
Many independent MPs have called for the major parties to end bracket creep and blamed them for failing to be transparent about collecting tax “through the backdoor”.
Meanwhile, former treasury assistant secretary David Pearl has called on Opposition Leader Peter Dutton to end bracket creep while hitting out at the Treasurer following his pre-budget speech on Tuesday.",SKY News,finance
Active Super fined $10.5m by Federal Court for misleading customers over greenwashing,James Harrison,https://www.skynews.com.au/business/finance/active-super-fined-105m-by-federal-court-for-misleading-customers-over-greenwashing/news-story/101764d44b762eb1af9e45c834c83f36,"A large Australian super fund has been forced to pay a $10.5m fine for misleading customers over its green investments.
Active Super, which currently manages about $29b for its 165,000 members, was fined by the Federal Court on Tuesday over deceptive marketing that led its customers to believe it eliminated investments that “posed too great a risk to the environment and the community”.
These included gambling, coal mining and oil or tar sands, alongside Russian investments following the invasion of Ukraine and took place between February 2021 and June 2023.
This follows a June 2024 ruling by the Federal Court that Active Super broke the law by investing in stocks that it claimed were eliminated or restricted by its environmental, social and governance (ESG) investment screens.
However, Active Super held investments with companies such as the gambling business SkyCity Entertainment Group Ltd, Russian entity Gazprom PJSC, Shell and Whitehaven Coal.
Sarah Court, the deputy chair of the Australian Securities and Investment Commission, said the fine sends a “strong message” to companies about making sustainable investment claims.
“This case demonstrates ASIC’s commitment to taking on misleading marketing and greenwashing claims made by companies promoting financial services,” Ms Court said in a statement.
“It is our third greenwashing court outcome, and we will continue to keep greenwashing in our sights.”
Federal Court Justice David O’Callaghan said Active Super “benefitted from its misleading conduct” as it misrepresented the “ethical” nature of its investment.
“(This) enhanced its ability to attract investors to the Active Super fund and enhanced its reputation as a provider of investment funds with ESG characteristics,” Justice O’Callaghan said in his judgement.
“As a result, investors lost the opportunity to invest in accordance with their investment values.”
He stressed that Active Super’s misleading conduct occurred over “an extensive period of time” and the failure to ensure its representations were not misleading or false was the responsibility of senior management.
“Further, when confronted with the allegations by ASIC, LGSS ran a host of contrived arguments in its defence at trial,” the Justice said.
Active Super merged with Vision Super at the start of this month.
At the end of the 2024 financial year, Active Super managed approximately $14.7 billion in superannuation assets for 86,547 members.",SKY News,finance
"RBA's interest rate cut 'may be too little, too late' for millions of Aussie households, according to Finder's Graham Cooke",James Harrison,https://www.skynews.com.au/business/finance/rbas-interest-rate-cut-may-be-too-little-too-late-for-millions-of-aussie-households-according-to-finders-graham-cooke/news-story/9e46b2b1e6e8794eb2a253330c72a693,"Tuesday’s rate cut “may be too little, too late” for millions of Aussies who have struggled with the cumulative impacts of post-pandemic inflation and high interest rates, according to new research.
The Reserve Bank of Australia finally dropped the cash rate by 25 basis points after keeping it held at 4.35 per cent for almost a year and a half.
This followed the central bank increasing rates 13 times from May 2022 to stamp out sky-high inflation, with families paying $26,000 to $50,000 more than they would have prior to the hikes.
While this cut would reduce the average home loan by $103 per year, this saving is just a fraction of what many mortgage holders need to feel “financially comfortable”, comparison site Finder revealed.
It said this saving was for a household on the average home loan of $641,416 – if their bank passed on the cut which the major four banks have already done.
However, 37 per cent of borrowers would need their repayments to drop by at least $500 to feel secure.
Graham Cooke, the head of consumer research at Finder, noted mortgage holders were still in a “very difficult position” as they continued to pay much higher rates than 5-10 years ago.
“This rate cut is a lifeline for millions of Australians teetering on the edge of mortgage default, but for some, it may be too little, too late,” Mr Cooke said in a statement.
“With millions of homeowners struggling to meet their repayments, the pressure on household budgets has reached a breaking point.
“While this rate drop provides some relief, many households will still need to make tough financial decisions to stay afloat.”
Finder research revealed that more than one third of mortgage holders struggled to make repayments in February, while 11 per cent of borrowers said they had missed a repayment in the past six months.
At least one in seven respondents have said they would lose their grip on their mortgage repayments by February if rates did not start to fall and a further 14 per cent said they needed a $1000 monthly drop.
Many Australians are hoping for multiple rate cuts this year, with three of the four major banks forecast a full per cent of rate cuts in 2025.
However the RBA dumped cold water on that prospect after the rate cut was revealed.
""If monetary policy is eased too much too soon, disinflation could stall, and inflation would settle above the midpoint of the target range,"" the bank said in a statement.
""In removing a little of the policy restrictiveness in its decision today, the Board acknowledges that progress has been made but is cautious about the outlook.""
RBA Governor Michele Bullock reiterated the central bank's caution towards declaring ""victory on inflation"" as price pressures continued to impact Aussies.
""It's not good enough for it to be back in the (2-3 per cent) target range temporarily, the board needs to be confident it's returning to the target range sustainably,"" Ms Bullock told reporters on Tuesday.
Market expectations of multiple interest rate cuts in 2025 were ""far too confident"", Ms Bullock stressed, as she told reporters there was uncertainty whether Tuesday's cut is ""one and done"".",SKY News,finance
"Australia faces 'deleterious consequences' unless government aids struggling business, reins in unsustainable spending",Max Melzer,https://www.skynews.com.au/business/finance/australia-faces-deleterious-consequences-unless-government-aids-struggling-business-reins-in-unsustainable-spending/news-story/7c931e6ec4b5c4ca5758d8dd4726510a,"Two of the nation's peak business groups have warned Australia faces ""deleterious consequences"" unless more is done to support the struggling private sector and rein in government spending at the next federal budget.
The Australian Industry Group (AiG) and Council of Small Business Organisations (COSOBA) both used pre-budget submissions to paint a bleak picture of the nation's private sector, with inflationary pressures threatening to completely stall economic growth.
Treasurer Jim Chalmers has recently talked up the importance of business in kickstarting Australia's economic recovery after months of sluggish growth.
However, the dual submissions raised serious concerns about whether this was possible, with the latter group revealing almost half of all small businesses were not breaking even.
""The economic environment has been challenging for many small businesses over the past year,"" COSOBA said.
""Growth in demand has slowed while input costs remain elevated, putting pressure on profitability – particularly for businesses reliant on discretionary consumer spending.
""The combined cost of living and the cost of doing business is taking a severe financial and emotional toll on individual business owners and the entire small business ecosystem.""
Approximately 49 per cent of small and medium business owners told the group they were feeling ""less optimistic"" about economic conditions in the year to come, with COSOBA calling on the government to provide greater support.
Big business is also feeling the pinch, with AiG revealing they faced the ""steepest rate of annual decline in gross operating margins"" since records of the measure began in 2001.
According to the industry group, the Producer Price Index, which measures inflation in goods used by various industries, has risen 14.6 per cent over the three years to the September quarter of 2024, with some sectors seeing even greater increases.
Manufacturing inputs rose 29 per cent over the period, while construction inputs jumped 33 per cent.
Gas prices have played a major role in the surging cost of doing business, with the price paid by manufacturers soaring 52 per cent higher.
Both COSOBA and AiG noted that while the Albanese government has been quick to roll out relief for consumers, particularly in the face of rising energy prices, similar support for business had been limited.
""It is not sustainable for businesses to keep absorbing inflation-driven input and wage costs without impacts on investment and employment,"" AiG wrote in their submission.
""Falling margins impact profitability, reducing the financial resources available as well as confidence for new investment and employment generation.
""Without a significant moderation in cost pressures on business, the wave of investment needed to kick-start private sector growth will not materialise.""
The warning is unlikely to be welcome news for the Treasurer as he works on drafting a pre-election budget aimed at inspiring confidence in Australia's economy.
Mr Chalmers has said private sector activity is ""the best kind of growth"" and talked up the Albanese government's job creation credentials in a bid to convince voters to hand Labor another term in office.
However, AiG also called into question how the government planned to manage Australia's surging public spending, warning the Treasurer the nation would face ""deleterious consequences"" unless action was taken.
""Federal spending is forecast to peak at 27.2 per cent of GDP in 2025-26, the highest level since the economic reforms of the mid-1980s,"" the group noted.
""This rate of increase in government spending is not sustainable in the medium term. Federal spending has increased at a much faster rate than revenue, creating a widening fiscal deficit that will reach $26.9 billion in underlying, and $47.8 billion in headline terms this financial year.
""Surging federal and state spending will have deleterious consequences for the prospects of a durable economic recovery in Australia.
""Managing structural deficits will necessitate either material cuts to key public services, an increase in taxes, and/or growing levels of public debt.""
While AiG highlighted some efforts to rein in spending were underway, citing reforms to the National Disability Insurance Scheme, it also signaled alarm at the Albanese government's characterisation of many increases in outlay as ""unavoidable"".
The industry group suggested this revealed the spending was ""an in-built tendency for cost-increases in the design of existing programs"", something which posed a significant risk to the nation's ongoing financial security.",SKY News,finance
Hip pocket relief finally arrives for millions of Aussie homeowners as RBA cuts rates for the first time since 2020,James Harrison,https://www.skynews.com.au/business/finance/wacth-live-rba-to-reveal-whether-aussies-will-be-delivered-a-much-needed-interest-rate-cut-for-the-first-time-since-2020/news-story/d68b9c246c08e25e382546b729404030,"Aussie mortgage holders have finally been delivered a much-needed rate cut, with the Reserve Bank of Australia lowering interest rates by 0.25 per cent for the first time since 2020.
Join Sky News Australia for all the leading coverage on the RBA’s long-awaited call and breaking news.
The cash rate was held at 4.35 per cent for more than a year as post-pandemic inflation slowly cooled.
That pause came after the RBA hiked rates 13 times from May 2022, over the period of about a year and a half, to stamp out soaring price pressures.
The central bank has now lowered the rate to 4.1 per cent, which could save the average homeowner about $1,200 over the coming 12 months.
All four major banks have now passed on rate cuts to their customers.
Tuesday's decision follows the Australian Bureau of Statistics revealing that trimmed mean inflation – the RBA’s preferred measure which examines the middle 70 per cent of price changes – dropped 0.4 per cent over the final three months of last year.
Annual price increases dropped to 3.2 per cent, this is still outside of the central bank’s two to three per cent target range.
The RBA noted that inflation had eased “a little more quickly than expected”, but added it was still cautiously monitoring future price pressures.
""If monetary policy is eased too much too soon, disinflation could stall, and inflation would settle above the midpoint of the target range,"" the bank said in a statement.
""In removing a little of the policy restrictiveness in its decision today, the Board acknowledges that progress has been made but is cautious about the outlook.""
Sky News' Business Editor Ross Greenwood said this sentiment would ""temper people's expectations"" and pointed to the United States - where rate cuts have slowed.
""You don't want to be like America where you suddenly find yourself having to stall those interest rate cuts or raise interest rates in the future because everybody starts spending and inflation takes off,"" he said.
RBA Governor Michele Bullock reiterated the central bank's caution towards declaring ""victory on inflation"" as price pressures continued to impact Aussies.
""It's not good enough for it to be back in the target range temporarily, the board needs to be confident it's returning to the target range sustainably,"" Ms Bullock told reporters on Tuesday.
She also stressed the decision ""does not imply"" that further rate cuts are coming, as the RBA board would need ""more evidence"" that inflation is continuing to decline.
Market expectations of multiple interest rate cuts in 2025 were ""far too confident"", Ms Bullock stressed, as she told reporters there was uncertainty whether Tuesday's cut is ""one and done"".
She said the board was still concerned about ""upside risks"" from inflation and was waiting to see the economy cool.
""We would need to see easing wage costs,"" Ms Bullock said.
""We need to continue to see the disinflation in market services in particular, we want to see the reduction in housing inflation - we’ve seen it’s sustainable and it’s continuing to come down.""
Treasurer Jim Chalmers said the RBA's rate call was a sign that price pressures had eased from their intense highs.
""Today’s decision and the statement from the Board gives us further confidence that the worst of the inflation challenge is behind us, but we can’t be complacent,"" he said in a statement.
Meanwhile, shadow treasurer Angus Taylor tore into Labor after the rate cut was announced, arguing that the cumulative impacts of post-pandemic inflation had meant Aussies were struggling.
""Despite the welcome cut today, it’s a long journey back to the standard of living Australians had when these interest rates increases began,"" he told reporters.
""We’ve seen 12 interest rate increases under Labor, and one down now, but we’ve also seen the biggest collapse in living standards in our history.""
Trimmed mean inflation has fallen from 6.8 per cent in December 2022, after soaring from the one to two per cent range in the second half of 2021.
The price pressures continue to hurt Aussies in their hip pocket, as the cumulative impacts of post-pandemic inflation mean everyday goods on average cost about 20 per cent more than in 2020.
Louise Southall, an economist at accounting software company Xero, said the rate cut will greatly bolster small businesses through lower borrowing costs and give customers more spending capacity, but also warned the cut itself was not a transformation.
""Rate cuts don't instantly flow through an economy and one rate cut in isolation is unlikely to be sufficient,"" Ms Southall said.
""It can take 18 months to two years for the benefits of lower interest rates to fully pass through.""
Charu Chanana, the chief investment strategist at Saxo, noted that expectations for multiple rate cuts this year should be tapered.
“While disinflation trends have allowed the RBA to start its rate cut cycle, there is still caution on the pace of easing given the tight labour market,” she said.
“The market has been quick to adjust, with one rate cut already pushed out from the RBA expectations curve for this year and only one further rate cut now expected.”
Many major banks and economists shifted their forecasts towards a February rate cut after the December quarter figures were published.
The market had factored in a 91 per cent chance of a drop, while NAB and Westpac both changed their forecasts to a February cut.
Three of the major banks are predicting a full per cent worth of drops throughout the coming 12 months.
Commonwealth Bank of Australia and Westpac both forecast the cash rate to hit 3.35 per cent by December, while NAB said it will hit 3.10 per cent by February.
ANZ is less optimistic than its main competitors, predicting the cash rate will hit 3.85 per cent by August.
Tim Lawless, the research director at analytics firm CoreLogic, said Aussies should not get their “hopes up” for a “a rapid or significant rate cutting cycle in the near term”.
“The RBA is likely to remain alert to the data flows, with persistently tight labour markets, a weak Australian dollar and elevated levels of global uncertainty remaining as downside factors that are likely to keep the loosening cycle a gradual and cautious one,” he said in a statement.",SKY News,finance
AustralianSuper CEO Paul Schroder warns government intervention on super investment would be an 'utter disaster',James Harrison,https://www.skynews.com.au/business/finance/australiansuper-ceo-paul-schroder-warns-government-intervention-on-super-investment-would-be-an-utter-disaster/news-story/8c643c5f004b1853f265377b952b0fe4,"The boss of Australia’s largest superannuation fund has decried government intervention into super investments as an “utter disaster” and said there was “nothing worse” than Treasurer Jim Chalmers' “imposition”.
The Treasurer came under fire in November for changing the Future Fund’s mandate to direct money into renewable energy, housing and infrastructure, with its architects labelling this “disgraceful”.
During the same month, Labor passed legislation that defined the objective of super as “to preserve savings to deliver income for a dignified retirement, alongside government support, in an equitable and sustainable way”.
Paul Schroder, the head of the nation’s biggest fund, AustralianSuper, was pressed on government intervention into how superannuation funds invest and whether this was something the industry has “got to be wary of”.
“There is nothing worse than the prospect of government intervening in investment decision-making. Nothing worse,” Mr Schroder told Business Weekend.
“In the Australian system, individual members carry the investment risk. You can't then impose decisions about investments on them.”
Mr Schroder said super funds ""must"" act in their members’ “best financial interest” to ensure the highest returns on their investments.
“It would be a disaster if a government of any persuasion, of any political colour, became involved in investment decision-making. An utter disaster,” the AustralianSuper CEO said.
Liberal Senator Andrew Bragg, who chaired an inquiry into Australia's superannuation system, agreed with Mr Schroder's point on directed investment, but lashed out about these funds ""ransacking Australia's housing stock"" under Labor.
""Big Super has spent the last few years under this government to get a special deal from the taxpayer to become Australian real estate barons during a housing crisis,"" Mr Bragg told SkyNews.com.au.
""Under Labor’s Build-to-Rent scheme, institutional investment funds have been gifted a tax break to ransack Australia’s housing stock.
""Labor’s Housing Australia Future Fund also features 'availability payments' which is taxpayers paying super funds to build and own houses that people can never buy.""
When Mr Chalmers revealed changes to the Future Fund, which was established in 2006 by the Howard government, he said it would still adhere to its commercial focus while “maximising its role in delivering for Australians in the future”.
The move attracted intense criticism with Peter Costello, the Howard-era treasurer and the fund’s former chair, saying the fund was “never set up to be a political slush fund” while deputy opposition leader Sussan Ley said the mandate directed money to Labor’s “pet projects”.
The Future Fund was originally established to cover unfunded superannuation liabilities for federal employees.
It aims for an annual return of at least 4-5 per cent above inflation “with an acceptable but not excessive level of risk”, its website states.
Alongside controversy over the Future Fund, Labor came under fire for its plans to double the tax rate on super earnings above $3m to 30 per cent while failing to index this threshold over time as inflation changes.
Labor’s legislation would also force people above this threshold to pay taxes for gains on assets in their super funds - such as farms or small businesses.
They would pay taxes on these gains now, despite the return from these assets not being realised.
Wilson Asset Managers’ founder Geoff Wilson lashed out at the government for going after unrealised capital gains.
“It’ll destroy some peoples' lives and taxing a profit that you might never get is illogical. It’s inequitable and it’s grossly unfair,” Mr Wilson told Sky News.",SKY News,finance
"Homeowners could slash six years off their mortgage if RBA cuts rates in line with predictions from three major banks, Finder report reveals",James Harrison,https://www.skynews.com.au/business/finance/homeowners-could-slash-six-years-off-mortgage-if-rba-cuts-rates-in-line-with-how-three-major-banks-predict-finder-report-reveals/news-story/b4624888a0ce0e9b4602471d49377c16,"Mortgage holders could wipe six years off the length of their loan if they keep up current repayments when interest rates go down, according to new research.
Comparison site Finder has revealed how Aussies can slash the time it takes to pay off their home amid widespread expectation the Reserve Bank of Australia will cut interest rates for the first time since 2020 this week.
The cash rate has been sitting at 4.35 per cent since November 2023 after the central bank regularly hiked rates over the previous year and a half.
After encouraging inflation data from the December quarter, every major bank predicts the cash rate will drop, while three of the four banks are expecting four rate cuts this year.
If the RBA does this, the average mortgage repayment could drop from 6.33 per cent to 5.33 per cent.
Finder said that mortgage holders who choose to reduce their payments could save an average of $4,830 this year, but those who have adjusted to the higher rates and can afford to continue paying at that level could benefit in the long term.
If they continue paying at this rate over the life of their 30-year mortgage, they would save $294,519 in interest while those who lower their repayments could save $143,593 - assuming there are no further rate changes.
Finder’s head of consumer research Graham Cooke said those who can maintain their higher mortgage repayments could own their home outright sooner.
“As borrowing costs fall, mortgage holders who commit to keeping their repayments at the same level could save thousands and years of making payments,” Mr Cooke said in a statement.
“The bonus is that if you do this, it won’t drive inflation, making more cash rate cute more likely.
""Not everyone will be taking this strategy with 40 per cent in mortgage stress according to Finder research.”
Commonwealth Bank of Australia and Westpac both forecast the cash rate to hit 3.35 by December, while NAB said it will hit 3.10 per cent by February.
ANZ is less optimistic than its main competitors, predicting the cash rate will hit 3.85 per cent by August.
Similar research emerged on Friday from Compare the Market, which predicted mortgage holder could be more than $1,200 better off over the course of a year from just one 0.25 per cent cut.
David Koch, the economic director at Compare the Market and former Sunrise host, said an upcoming rate cut had “been a long time coming” and would give much needed “breathing room in the household budget” for those who had been struggling.
He also warned that banks may not pass on a reduced rate to its customers if the RBA slashes rates and advised prospective or current mortgage holders to push for better rates or move to a lender that is offering a better deal.
“Your loyalty could be costing you,” Koch said.
“It simply doesn’t make sense to be paying a cent more than you need to.”",SKY News,finance
AMP comes under fire from Finance Sector Union for 'draconian' contract allowing surveillance of employees at home,James Harrison,https://www.skynews.com.au/business/finance/amp-comes-under-fire-from-finance-sector-union-for-draconian-contract-allowing-surveillance-of-employees-at-home/news-story/7e536d0c800816b3bbff2f84a297f784,"Staff at a major superannuation fund have been given one week to sign a contract which allows surveillance of its employees working from home, selling their personal information and making them undergo a medical exam.
The contract from AMP, which has been panned as “draconian” by the Finance Sector Union, also forbids workers from seeking advice about this contract from a lawyer or accountant without the company’s permission, The Australian has revealed.
It also requires former employees to assist the super fund with legal proceedings for upwards of seven years.
About 2000 staff members were handed the contracts on Monday and given until March 24 to sign and return them.
The contracts would force employees to give up rights such as penalties, overtime and annual leave in exchange for a “flat rate” of pay, according to FSU.
It also said staffers were being incentivised to sign these contracts with a $1000 share plan grant and failure to sign will mean they are not eligible for employee incentive programs.
“This is a draconian contract that features some very disturbing surveillance and medical privacy provisions,” FSU’s national assistant secretary Nicole McPherson said in a statement.
“It is shocking that any employer would propose the right to video monitor its workers in their own homes, force them to undergo a medical examination by the employer’s doctor of choice and give up their right to privacy of medical information.”
The contract says AMP  “may carry out continuous, ongoing camera surveillance on or around the premises of AMP and in any other place where you work”, with one day’s notice.
Ms McPherson said the fund could possibly monitor employees via built in cameras on people’s computers when they are working at home.
“Is this legal? Well, that really depends on the state, but we have some serious concerns,” she told Sky News on Friday.
The union is advising AMP workers not to sign this contract and has proposed a litany of changes.
“We're waiting to hear back, but workers only have until Monday to sign this contract so AMP is absolutely on the clock,” Ms McPherson said.
“It's really up to them now to see whether they're going to do the right thing or not.”
AMP is also trying to undermine the right to disconnect through a clause in some contracts that requires workers to reply to contact from the super fund and third parties outside work hours, the union said.
The contract also allows AMP to change work location at any time and enforces limitations on damages for breaches of the contract that involve personal illness.
Ms McPherson called on AMP to come to the negotiating table as the contract fails to include critical details usually found in these agreements.
“Because AMP refuses to bargain for a new Enterprise Agreement, important rights are in policy, meaning AMP can remove or change things at any time,” she said.
“For example, the new contract does not contain details of any guaranteed pay increase, leave or redundancy entitlements.
“AMP needs to come to the table and urgently negotiate an Enterprise Agreement which would give its workers rights and protection.”
An AMP spokesperson defended the surveillance of the workers and insisted they would not be video monitored at home.
""(The surveillance clauses) are common in most contemporary employment contracts, including the right to monitor employee computer usage on employer-provided devices when they are ­working from home,” the spokesperson told The Australian.
“References to camera surveillance relate to CCTV cameras used in and around AMP premises, and we will not conduct camera surveillance on employees when they work from home.”",SKY News,finance
Star Entertainment Group close to selling stake in Brisbane-based Queen's Wharf precinct in last-minute life saving effort,James Harrison,https://www.skynews.com.au/business/finance/star-entertainment-group-close-to-selling-stake-in-brisbanebased-queens-wharf-precinct-in-lastminute-life-saving-effort/news-story/aa22e8744fd2f335996e6f16d4f3fc39,"Star Entertainment Group is close to selling its stake in the Queen’s Wharf precinct to Hong Kong-based investors in a deal that could secure $50 million for the company as it attempts to stave off collapse.
The embattled casino operator has desperately sought more cash as it was forced into a trading halt earlier this week after failing to publish its half-year financial results by the Friday deadline.
Media reports arose on Thursday that Star is close to securing a deal where it will sell off its stake in the Brisbane property to Far East Consortium and Chow Tai Fook – which each own 25 per cent stakes in the precinct.
This comes about a month after the casino operator confirmed it had knocked back several offers from the Hong Kong investors as they could not come to an agreement on key details.
The new deal could prevent Star from going into administration by this weekend, according to The Australian.
Star’s chief executive Steve McCann is also looking at securing the $60m from the sale of its events centre at its Sydney premises, which remains in escrow.
The casino operator in January revealed the sale of the complex – which it had previously described as a $100m venue – to Foundation Theatres.
Its attempts to secure more cash comes at it owes about $430m to an array of lenders.
Sky News' Business Reporter Ed Boyd said Star was paying an interest rate to banks of ""around 16 per cent"".
He also noted the company's future in administration could cost around $300m but stressed there is an option for the company to secure more cash.
""Pub baron Bruce Mathieson's company, they've place a $550m bid just for the Gold Coast Jupiter's Casino - that's been knocked back but that bid is still on the table,"" Boyd said.
Star had just $78m left as of December 31 after churning through $107m over the previous three months.
It recently said it was considering a $650m financial lifeline from American asset management firm Oaktree Capital Management which could help it stay afloat.
However, this deal could be in doubt, according to Sky News’ Ross Greenwood, as Oaktree wants the ""rights over the property"" where the Star Casino in Sydney sits, which is owned by the NSW Government.
“My understanding of it is that there is no way known that the New South Wales Government will give that up easily,"" Greenwood said.
“In fact, the NSW Government, in my understanding, would allow the Star to go into insolvency and then deal with the administrators.”
Prior to Greenwood’s revelation, Star briefly put itself into a trading halt only to resume trading a short time later without alerting shareholders.
Star also noted it could post its results if it received an appropriate liquidity proposal, with the group anticipating “one or more” on Friday.
However, the company has been unable to secure a new finance deal.
The Australian Securities Exchange on Monday alerted shareholders that Star, alongside seven other publicly listed companies, was suspended from trading for failing to publish their results.
Star confirmed it was ""unlikely"" to lodge its financial results unless it had secured a lifeline that would ""refinance all of the group's existing corporate debt"" and provide ""additional liquidity"".",SKY News,finance
"RBA 'could easily' hike rates later this year if it cuts this week, Warren Hogan warns as every major bank forecasts a drop",James Harrison,https://www.skynews.com.au/business/finance/rba-could-easily-hike-rates-later-this-year-if-it-cuts-this-week-warren-hogan-warns-as-every-major-bank-forecasts-a-drop/news-story/8026e036f7725a7303c621eb26c944f1,"Aussies could be plagued by more interest rate hikes later in the year if the Reserve Bank of Australia drops the cash rate on Tuesday, a leading economist has warned.
Many banks and financial institutions have forecasted the RBA will drop interest rates for the first time since 2020.
After the publication of encouraging inflation data from the December quarter, every major bank now forecasts an interest rate drop, while the market has factored in a 90 per cent chance of a cut.
Judo Bank’s chief economist Warren Hogan, who has warned the central bank against cutting rates in February and in 2024 called for several hikes, said a cut could spell trouble for home owners later on in the year.
“If they do go tomorrow, I think there'll be a very cautious guidance from the Governor, in her press conference as well as in the policy statement,” Mr Hogan told Sky News on Monday.
“There's a very good chance that it'll be a one off and then it's really up anyone's guess what the next move will be and it could easily be a hike later in the year or next year.”
While Mr Hogan predicts the cut will be a “one off”, all four major banks are predicting multiple cuts throughout the year.
Commonwealth Bank of Australia and Westpac both forecast the cash rate to hit 3.35 per cent by December, while NAB said it will hit 3.10 per cent by February.
ANZ is less optimistic than its main competitors, predicting the cash rate will hit 3.85 per cent by August.
Mr Hogan said the “worst case” for the RBA was if it cut rates and if “the way the economy plays out” shows this was the “wrong move”.
“There's absolutely nothing going on in our economy that suggests a series of rate cuts is in order because rate cuts are driven typically by weakness in the economy and we’re just not seeing that,” he said.
“We've seen a rebound in retail sales, employment growth is strong, unemployment is heading lower and, of course, importantly, we're starting to see some improvement in the housing market in the last few weeks and that's already very unaffordable.”
Charu Chanana, the chief investment strategist at Saxo Bank, has also said that even if the RBA cuts rates by 0.25 per cent on Tuesday, it will “maintain a very cautious, very hawkish tone”.
“Plus, the market is currently pricing in three cuts in 2025, which seems a bit excessive, so the RBA will need to bring that down,” Ms Chanana in a statement.
The future of rate cuts could also depend on how United States President Donald Trump’s tariffs impact global trading, according to veteran financial expert Peter Switzer.
He said the RBA would like to have a few rate cuts in its “holster” if Australia was rattled by President Trump’s protectionist policy.
“We might see two interest rate cuts in a row if they're worried about the global economy,” Mr Switzer told Sky News.
Interest rates have been held at 4.35 per cent since November 2023 after the RBA starting increasing rates in May 2022.
Trimmed mean inflation – the RBA’s preferred measure - has fallen from 6.8 per cent in December 2022 after soaring from the 1-2 per cent range in the second half of 2021.
It was at 3.2 per cent in the December quarter, just outside of the central bank’s target range.",SKY News,finance

Qantas to pay shareholders hundreds of millions in first dividend since 2019 as it announces major Boeing 737 upgrades,James Harrison,https://www.skynews.com.au/business/finance/qantas-group-to-pay-shareholders-hundreds-of-millions-in-first-dividend-since-2019-as-travel-demand-continues-to-soar/news-story/71b6c189a55816803e1800f8e8fa0d32,"Qantas Group has posted a $923m profit for the first half of the 2025 financial year as it looks to revitalise its aircraft and pay shareholders a dividend for the first time since the pandemic amid soaring travel demand.
The company, which includes its budget subsidiary Jetstar, said its strong performance was driven by its “dual brand strategy” as premium and corporate travellers flocked to Qantas and many everyday travellers opted for the low cost alternative.
Qantas Group said it will pay a fully franked dividend of 26.4 cents per share, with chief executive Vanessa Hudson telling shareholders the company’s stellar performance facilitated this.
“Our financial strength means we are now in a position to pay our shareholders dividends for the first time in almost six years,” Ms Hudson said.
The company's board said it has approved a $250m base dividend (16.5 cents per share) and a $150m special dividend (9.9 cents per share) to be paid April 16.
Alongside the dividend, the airline said it had paid 27,000 non-executive employees $1000 each as a ""thank you payment"" in December.
Qantas also noted a drop with international airfares of about 6.6 per cent, while domestic flights increased 0.8 per cent.
Jetstar’s low fares were a point of pride for the company as about one third of tickets below $100 for the six-month period.
“Qantas and Jetstar made travel possible for more Australians, carrying 28 million customers, with around one third of Jetstar customers travelling for under $100 at a time of ongoing cost of living pressures,” Ms Hudson said.
More aircraft and a fleet renewal were also at the forefront in Qantas' financial results with the carrier confirming 11 new planes joined the group in the six months to December while another seven are coming in the second half of this financial year.
The company added more short-medium haul A321LRs and A320neos to Jetstar’s fleet while five new smaller A220s joined the Qantas network’s fleet.
Qantas will welcome its first A321XLR alongside two more A220s while Jetstar will welcome four additional planes.
It is also investing in a major refurbishment of its 737s, which are used for inter-city routes and short-haul international destinations such as New Zealand and nations in the Pacific.
At least 42 aircraft will receive new business and economy seats alongside larger overhead lockers and the planes will be fitted out with new carpets, sidewalls and mood lighting.
Ms Hudson said these refurbishments, which are expected from 2027, were critical for bolstering the passenger experience.
“Previous cabin upgrade programs have delivered great outcomes for our customers, and allowed us to bring next generation designs and technologies to current fleet that reflect how our customers want to travel,” she said.
“This investment in cabins will also support our people who are dedicated to providing the best inflight experience to our customers.""
The company also saw its loyalty program jump with an 11 per cent growth in active members compared to 1H24 and expects to see revenue increase by about 3-5 per cent in the second half of the financial year.
Qantas shares shot up more than five per cent on Thursday after the company announced its results.
This follows a whopping 78 per cent rise over the past 12 months as the carrier continued to recover from its reputational crisis over 2022 and 2023.
Thursday’s results follow Qantas delivering a $1.25b profit in FY24, a 28 per cent drop from its record result in the previous financial year when soaring airfares and reputational woes plagued the carrier as it posted record results.",SKY News,finance
Climate activist tech billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes laments 'deep internal conflict' over purchasing private jet,James Harrison,https://www.skynews.com.au/business/finance/climate-activist-tech-billionaire-mike-cannonbrookes-laments-deep-internal-conflict-over-purchasing-private-jet/news-story/cfd132e5a861e8695c58c401a9805554,"A billionaire tech entrepreneur and climate activist has lamented his “deep internal conflict” over owning a private jet after his multi-million-dollar purchase was exposed earlier this week.
Mike Cannon-Brookes, the co-founder of Australian software giant Atlassian, took to LinkedIn on Thursday to explain his decision to purchase a Bombardier 7500, an aircraft believed to cost upwards of US$75m (AU$119.2m), according to Business Insider.
It followed a report in The Australian Financial Review’s Rear Window column the aircraft was confirmed to be Mr Cannon-Brookes' and was spotted at Sunshine Coast and Essendon airports and had recently made a trip to London around the launch of the Formula One, where Atlassian sponsors a team.
“I’m not denying I have a deep internal conflict on this,” Mr Cannon-Brookes wrote on LinkedIn.
“There’s a couple of reasons I’ve purchased a plane. Personal security is the primary reason (an unfortunate reality of my world), but also so I can run a global business from Australia, and still be a constantly present dad.”
The Atlassian founder's plane purchase comes as he has championed many environmentally friendly causes and initiatives over the span of his career.
In 2022, he made an $8b bid alongside a consortium led by Canadian investment firm Brookfield to purchase Aussie power giant AGL Energy and shut down its coal operations and replace them with renewable projects.
He has backed a renewable energy project called SunCable which, in 2024, won government approval to build the first phase of an undersea cable between Darwin and Singapore to deliver solar-generated electricity.
Mr Cannon-Brookes has also backed green philanthropic fund Terra.do which aims to shift 100,000 Australians into clean energy roles by 2027.
With the many green moves under his belt, the Atlassian founder noted the jet purchase was a “trade-off” he decided to make.
“Although private aviation is far from a big contributor to global emissions, it is a carbon-intensive way to travel,” he said.
“Aviation is one of the most difficult sectors to decarbonise due to the distance of flights and the energy density of fuel.”
Mr Cannon-Brookes said he has an “extremely rigorous carbon regime” for flying as he uses “direct air capture and sustainable fuels for the carbon and contrails” which allows him “to far exceed"" his flight footprint.
“My commitment to climate is as strong as ever,” he said.
“I’m still pretty damn focused on making an impact at a large scale, removing huge volumes of emissions through active investments and philanthropy…and have the proud, scars to prove it.”
Former AFR columnist and founder of Rampart Joe Aston lashed the Atlassian founder’s attempted justification for purchasing, particularly his concerns about “personal security”.
“Watching him lie to himself so publicly in order to maintain his self-narrative of a moral actor is actually more delicious than the jet purchase itself,” Aston wrote.
Mr Cannon-Brookes has a collective wealth with his ex-wife Annie Cannon-Brookes of $24.38b, according to the AFR Rich List.
It is unclear how the funds have been split up since their 2023 divorce.",SKY News,finance
Sky News Australia's Ross Greenwood unveils bombshell revelation about Star Entertainment Group after it entered a trading halt,James Harrison,https://www.skynews.com.au/business/finance/sky-news-australias-ross-greenwood-unveils-bombshell-revelation-about-star-entertainment-group-after-it-entered-a-trading-halt/news-story/52c51172e10a96c186140b52b451bb9e,"Star Entertainment Group could be destined for administration as discord between a potential investor and the NSW Government rages on, Sky News Australia's Business Editor Ross Greenwood has revealed.
Star entered a brief trading halt on Friday and failed to publish its mid-year results by the deadline as it continues to battle liquidity woes.
The company said last week it was considering a $650m financial lifeline from American asset management firm Oaktree Capital Management that could help it stay afloat.
Greenwood said that Oaktree wants the ""rights over the property"" where the Star Casino in Sydney sits, which is owned by the NSW Government.
“My understanding of it is that there is no way known that the New South Wales Government will give that up easily,"" Greenwood said.
“In fact, the NSW Government, in my understanding, would allow the Star to go into insolvency and then deal with the administrators.”
He noted that Star, which has operations in Brisbane and the Gold Coast alongside its Sydney premises, would also deal with the Queensland Government but stressed there would not be a Federal bailout as there was with the Whyalla Steelworks.
Greenwood added that if Star were to go into administration, its eight thousand staff members “might end up back on the Federal Government’s coin” through the wages guarantee scheme.
He said the NSW Government would likely wait for the company to go under.
“The NSW Government, as I understand it, will only deal with anybody once it's in administration, not beforehand, and it will not easily give up the land on which that Sydney casino sits,” he said.
If Star were to enter administration, it could still operate as a hotel and as a gaming operator if there was somebody to manage it, Greenwood said.
“The administrator, I understand, will get an exemption to be able to run the gaming floors until there's a sale,” he said.
“But the fact of the matter is that anybody who walks in would have to be properly qualified in the eyes of the gaming regulator in NSW, Philip Crawford.”
Greenwood pointed out another wrinkle in Star’s future: a fine from the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre, which could be in the hundreds of millions.
“Anybody who were to take on the Star right now would also have to consider there's a massive fine or penalty coming from AUSTRAC for breaches of anti -money laundering procedures,” he said.
“That could be as much as 400 million dollars.”
After Star briefly entered a trading halt on Friday, it said it would only be able to post its results if it received an apt liquidity proposal, with the group anticipating to receive ""one or more"" on Friday.
""It is likely that the 1HFY25 Report will only be able to be finalised if the company has received liquidity proposals which, after appropriate consideration by the Directors, are sufficiently capable of being progressed to finalisation in the context of determining whether the Company can continue as a going concern,"" the company said.
Star’s price took a hefty dive of about 15 per cent on Friday.
The company has not yet released its financial statement and Friday's trading halt marks its second in six months.",SKY News,finance
‘Politicking’: Insurance Council of Australia CEO Andrew Hall pushes back after Anthony Albanese targets insurance companies,James Harrison,https://www.skynews.com.au/business/finance/politicking-insurance-council-of-australia-ceo-andrew-hall-pushes-back-after-anthony-albanese-targets-insurance-companies/news-story/76657c9c7c6294bd4b1355080ff295c9,"An insurance expert has called for the end of “politicking around insurers and insurance companies” just a day after Prime Minister Anthony Albanese targeted his sights at the companies and backed a claim they were ripping Aussies off.
Tens of thousands of Australians in south-east Queensland and northern NSW have submitted insurance claims as the mostly disappeared ex-Tropical Cyclone Alfred has left flood and storm damage.
Mr Albanese raised concerns about insurance during an interview where he agreed with former Sunrise host David “Kochie” Koch’s argument that insurance companies are “ripping us off”.
“I say that Kochie’s right, and we will certainly hold the insurance companies to account,’’ Mr Albanese said on Monday.
“This is a time where they need to do a bit of repair of their relationships with the Australian public, by doing the right thing and making payments immediately for people who are eligible. That’s what people who are eligible for. That’s what people expect.”
The Insurance Council of Australia’s chief executive Andrew Hall responded to recent attacks against insurers in a Sky News interview on Tuesday.
“Insurers are working very hard,” Mr Hall said.
“I want to push past this politicking around insurers and insurance companies. I know we are an easy target here.”
He also pushed back against claims that insurance companies were the cause of inflation as Kochie also claimed they had doubled their premiums in recent years.
Mr Hall said insurers are “price takers” and their premiums reflected supply chain cost increases funnelling onto these companies.
“Insurance premiums are being driven by the inflation,” he said.
“We're at the end of that chain and your insurance premium renews annually.”
The ICA boss has also stressed insurers’ desire to “work with government to reduce risk” as the rates of inflation impacting insurance companies had soared over recent years.
“Every year when an insurance premium is priced, (insurers) look at building in a two or three per cent increase in inflation if they need to rebuild or repair your home,” Mr Hall said.
“What's happened in the last few years is that those increases have been double digit and in totality around about 40 per cent more expensive these days to rebuild a home.”
He said Aussies could soon see their insurance premiums drop if a political party at the upcoming election vowed to scrap stamp duty off insurance policies.
“Around Australia, in the last 12 months alone, $8.6 billion was paid by Australian consumers of insurance in taxes,” Mr Hall said.
“That is more than a third more than insurance companies made in profit.”
Mr Hall's comments come as the ICA has recently called for a $30b fund to be created by federal and state governments for flood defence.
It will build new infrastructure to protect homes and businesses and relocate those at high risk.
“As extreme weather intensifies and populations expand, a greater focus on and investment in flood defence is required,” Mr Hall said in a proposal.
Approximately 225,000 homes and 73,000 businesses face at least a two or five per cent chance of flooding each year, according to the council.
Most of these homes and businesses are in NSW, while Queensland has the second largest number of properties at risk.",SKY News,finance
Victoria to receive billions of dollars of extra GST in a move welcomed by the Allan govt as it grapples with state's soaring debt,Bryant Hevesi,https://www.skynews.com.au/business/finance/victoria-to-receive-billions-of-dollars-of-extra-gst-in-a-move-welcomed-by-the-allan-govt-as-it-grapples-with-states-soaring-debt/news-story/05a5b053fbad9b6c2688b5e00a1225a5,"Victoria is set to receive billions of dollars of extra tax revenue next financial year in a move welcomed by the Allan government as it grapples with the state's soaring debt.
The Commonwealth Grants Commission on Friday revealed its GST carve-up between the states and territories for 2025-26, with Victoria set to be handed about $26 billion.
That figure is $3.7 billion higher than Victoria's GST allocation for this financial year.
Victorian Treasurer Jaclyn Symes, who will hand down her first budget in about two months, promised residents the Allan government ""will use our fairer share of funding to deliver the priorities of Victorians"".
The CGC's decision means Victoria will have the largest slice of the $95.1 billion GST pie next financial year, even outstripping New South Wales, which is home to about 1.5 million more residents.
NSW will get about $25.5 billion, an increase of $942 million, followed by Queensland (about $16.6 billion), South Australia (about $9 billion), Western Australia (about $7.8 billion), the Northern Territory (about $4.5 billion), Tasmania (about $3.6 billion) and the Australian Capital Territory (about $1.9 billion).
The CGC said the increased GST for Victoria was settled on due to its ""changes in population and its share of the growth in the GST pool"".
Victoria was also noted to have a lower capacity to generate revenue from state taxes compared to other jurisdictions.
The CGC said the state ""can only raise $32 per person from mining royalties, which is below the national average of $1,305 per person"" and ""can raise $259 per person from insurance tax, which is below the national average of $314 per person"".
While it was pointed out the cost of government services in Victoria was lower than the national average given its more urbanised population and that its ""First Nations population, for which service costs are higher, comprises 1.2 per cent of the state's population, compared with the national average of 3.8 per cent"", it was determined that ""overall, the below-average revenue raising capacity in Victoria outweighs its below-average cost of providing services"".
The CGC said factors taken into account when calculating Victoria's allocation included increases in royalties in the main coal-producing states which reduced the state's ""relative revenue raising capacity"", as well as ""an assessment of COVID-19 business support expenses"" and ""a new assessment of COVID-19 health expenses"".
Ms Symes said it was about time pandemic investments were taken into account as part of ""much needed changes to the way the Commission calculates GST"".
""The Commission confirms that our population and economy are growing and this has driven a need for more services and infrastructure which we are delivering,"" she said.
""The report also recognises that other states like Western Australia, Queensland and New South Wales are booming off the back of high coal and iron ore prices - which Victoria does not benefit from.
""It has also finally been able to implement the argument put forward by Victoria and New South Wales that the significant investments made during the pandemic by state governments needed to be factored into these calculations.""
Ms Symes said Victoria had been short changed billions and billions of dollars since the GST was introduced by the Howard government more than two decades ago.
""Since the creation of the GST, Victoria has subsidised every other state. This means Victoria has received around $31 billion less than its population share over that time,"" she said.
""This distribution of the GST has never been fair, which is why we welcome the recommendation from the Commonwealth Grants Commission.
""Last year, Victoria received the second-lowest total revenue per capita among all states and territories at just $13,500, across taxes, royalties, and Commonwealth grants.""
Shadow treasurer James Newbury said the CGC's review marked ""a red-letter day, as Victoria has officially shifted from an economic leader to a national tax taker"".
""Instead of creating a strong and self-sustaining economy, Labor continues to rely on high taxes, skyrocketing debt, and handouts from Canberra, pushing more Victorians to the brink while failing to invest in the infrastructure and services our state desperately needs,"" he said.
The confirmation of the extra GST comes just weeks after the Allan government announced an independent review into its spending as it needed to have a ""laser focus on every dollar of expenditure"".
Premier Jacinta Allan said the government was cracking down on waste, duplication and inefficiencies across the public service, with up to 3,000 jobs expected to be cut, which equates to about a six per cent reduction in head count.
The government expects ""several billion dollars of savings"" to come out of the review, due to be handed down by the end of June, but frontline services will be spared from the budget cuts.
A budget update tabled in parliament last December stated Victoria's net debt would be $155.2 billion this financial year, rising to $168.5 billion in 2025-26, $179 billion in 2026-27 and $187.3 billion in 2027-28.",SKY News,finance
Inflation ticks back up 0.1 per cent in January as state and federal cost of living measures ease for millions of Aussies,James Harrison,https://www.skynews.com.au/business/finance/inflation-ticks-back-up-01-per-cent-in-january-as-state-and-federal-cost-of-living-measures-ease-for-millions-of-aussies/news-story/1c617527b00dfb5309a601e837d483e4,"Inflation has slowly ticked upwards as the impact of government handouts aimed at alleviating cost of living pressures begin to ease.
The latest monthly figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed annual headline inflation was steady at 2.5 per cent while trimmed mean inflation – the middle 70 per cent of price changes – rose 0.1 per cent to 2.8 per cent for January.
KPMG chief economist Brendan Rynne said the latest data was “not surprising” when speaking with Sky News on Wednesday and pointed to seasonably adjusted inflation.
“It’s not surprising that headline rate is starting to tick back up,” he said.
“You’ve had four months in a row where the seasonably adjusted rate has gone from 2.2 per cent on an annual basis to now 2.7 per cent.
“What you’re seeing in that is really the winding out of some of those cost of living support packages, particularly around electricity that were put in place in July of last year.”
Energy was down 11.5 per cent for the year to January as government rebates, which included $300 from the Albanese government in four equal payments across the year and other state relief, drove down power prices.
Queenslanders were given a one-off $1,000 rebate from July, while Western Australia residents received two equal $200 instalments from July and December from their state government and Tasmania delivered a one-off $250 rebate.
January’s power price drop was larger than in previous months, with electricity falling 35.6 per cent in the 12 months to October.
ABS head of price statistics, Michelle Marquardt, said the timing of these rebates contributed to this change in power prices.
“The impact of the rebates was lower in January than December as some households had exhausted the full value of the rebate,” she said.
Excluding all state and federal government rebates, electricity prices would have fallen 1.2 per cent in the 12 months to January 2025 compared to an annual fall of 0.9 per cent to December 2024.
The ABS noted that electricity was excluded from the trimmed mean inflation figure.
It also found that food prices were up 3.3 per cent, while both clothing and housing were up 2.1 per cent each.
The recent inflation numbers come after the Reserve Bank of Australia dropped the cash rate for the first time since 2020, as post-pandemic inflation has slowly tapered back towards the central bank’s two to three per cent target range.
It primarily examines trimmed mean inflation, amongst other economic factors, when considering its call on the cash rate.
Senior APAC economist at Capital Economics Abhijit Surya said government subsidies have distorted the view of headline inflation and meant the RBA has put greater focus on the trimmed mean figure.
“The RBA has argued that headline inflation is not the main show in town, given that it remains distorted by myriad government subsidies,” he said.
“Therefore, it will continue to pay more attention to measures of underlying inflation.”
The central bank’s recent rate drop may be the only rate cut for some time as the RBA noted inflation had eased “a little more quickly than expected”, but added it was still cautiously monitoring future price pressures.
""If monetary policy is eased too much too soon, disinflation could stall, and inflation would settle above the midpoint of the target range,"" the bank said in a statement.
""In removing a little of the policy restrictiveness in its decision today, the Board acknowledges that progress has been made but is cautious about the outlook.""",SKY News,finance
No plans for Australian crypto reserve as US President Donald Trump reveals five currencies for major stockpile,James Harrison,https://www.skynews.com.au/business/finance/no-plans-for-australian-crypto-reserve-as-us-president-donald-trump-reveals-five-currencies-for-major-stockpile/news-story/2dfd31b7c7df97ba52e802f9cd584cb5,"The Australian government will not establish a crypto reserve as United States President Donald Trump continues to embrace the digital assets and rolls back regulation.
Cryptocurrencies soared on Monday after President Trump revealed the five currencies that would make up the US Crypto Reserve as he looks to “elevate” the industry.
“A U.S. Crypto Reserve will elevate this critical industry after years of corrupt attacks by the Biden Administration,” he wrote on his social media platform Truth Social.
He said cryptocurrencies Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA) will make up the Crypto Reserve, alongside leading currencies Bitcoin and Ethereum.
“I will make sure the U.S. is the Crypto Capital of the World,” President Trump wrote.
While the US President creates a stockpile, Labor has taken a different approach, with a spokesperson for Assistant Treasurer and Financial Services Minister Stephen Jones lauding the government’s efforts to regulate digital and crypto asset platforms and currencies.
“The Albanese government has consulted on our proposed framework to build a fit-for-purpose digital asset regulatory regime, and we continue to work closely with industry,” the spokesperson said.
“The Albanese government knows that blockchain and digital assets present big opportunities for our economy, our financial sector and innovation.”
Labor has no plans to establish a crypto reserve and remains focused on regulating digital asset platforms.
The US President’s announcement caused several cryptocurrencies to skyrocket, with Sol rising almost 20 per cent and ADA up more than 63 per cent.
Meanwhile, XRP was up about 28 per cent while Ethereum and Bitcoin jumped 11 and eight per cent respectively.
Prior to Monday’s spike, Bitcoin suffered its worst month since June 2022 after it soared on the back of President Trump’s election win.
The Crypto Reserve has faced scepticism from Caroline Bowler, the chief executive of Australian cryptocurrency exchange BTC Markets, who raised concerns over government influence on the currencies.
“One of the core principles of cryptocurrency is its ability to exist outside of government influence,” Ms Bowler said in a statement.
“However, if major assets are increasingly tied to specific jurisdictions, it could lead to a concentration of power that contradicts the foundational ethos of crypto.”
In January, President Trump signed an executive order on digital assets that explored the creation of a national cryptocurrency stockpile and ordered that banking services for crypto companies be protected.
President Trump won support from the crypto industry in his 2024 election bid and he has quickly moved to back their policy priorities.
He is hosting the first White House Crypto Summit on Friday and his family has also launched its own coins.
Under the Biden administration, regulators cracked down on the industry in a bid to protect Americans from fraud and money laundering.
However, since the beginning of President Trump's term the Securities and Exchange Commission has withdrawn investigations into several crypto companies and dropped a lawsuit against Coinbase, the largest crypto exchange in the US.

RBA Governor Michele Bullock reveals group worst hit by cost of living crisis during parliamentary showdown,James Harrison,https://www.skynews.com.au/business/finance/rba-governor-michele-bullock-reveals-group-worst-hit-by-cost-of-living-crisis-during-parliamentary-showdown/news-story/c1417107627f18cdb4d8f8c504423c19,"Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Michele Bullock has revealed the group of Aussies hardest hit by the crippling cost of living crisis.
Ms Bullock fronted a parliamentary inquiry on Friday, just days after the RBA cut interest rates for the first time since 2020.
She was grilled, alongside fellow members of the central bank, about the RBA’s outlook on future rate cuts, its target for inflation and the impact United States President Donald Trump’s tariffs could have on Australia.
During the session, the RBA Governor also revealed low-income renters were the cohort hardest hit by tough cost of living pressures that have plagued Aussies for over a year.
“That would be, I think, the group that is often forgotten. I just want to make sure that people understand they are people that have really been hurt very hard by this,” Ms Bullock told the inquiry.
“They’ve seen a massive increase in rents and they’ve also experienced massive inflation.
“So they’re not going to necessarily benefit from the decrease in interest rates. They are going to benefit as inflation starts to come down, and it is coming down, so that’s beneficial for them.”
Inflation peaked at 7.8 per cent in December 2022 as the post-pandemic price rises were felt acutely around the nation.
While this slowly settled to 2.4 per cent by December 2024, the cumulative impacts of inflation means prices have risen by about 20 per cent since 2020.
This comes as rents also soared after the pandemic, with the Australian Bureau of Statistics reporting a 6.4 per cent increase in the 12 months to December 2024.
Rents were also up 7.3 per cent in the year to December 2023, with Ms Bullock pointing to housing supply as a reason for these increases.
“We’ve still got an issue with supply and demand for housing,” Ms Bullock said.
“But what we have observed is that rents are starting to come down. So that’s really positive for them.”
In her opening remarks to the inquiry, the RBA Governor said she was pleased with the rate at which inflation has eased, but noted there was more to do.
“Underlying inflation has eased over the past three quarters, and in the December quarter it was a bit lower than we had forecast. This has increased our confidence that inflation is heading in the right direction,” Ms Bullock said.
“Looking over the past three years, I think we can be satisfied with the progress made so far, though our job is definitely not done.”
She said the RBA board was cautious about further rate cuts, however, three of the four major banks have factored in a full per cent of drops in 2025.
“We have not pre-committed to any particular course of action on interest rates,” the RBA governor said.
“But in the forecasts published this week, the central projection suggests that if monetary policy is eased too quickly or by too much, disinflation could stall and inflation would settle above the midpoint of the target range.”",SKY News,finance
Millions of Aussies likely to soon receive first mortgage relief in years as RBA tipped to announce rate cut on Tuesday,James Harrison,https://www.skynews.com.au/business/finance/millions-of-aussies-likely-to-soon-receive-first-mortgage-relief-in-years-as-rba-tipped-to-announce-rate-cut-on-tuesday/news-story/7572a9e8ec03a97edf2a878014c0ac30,"Aussie mortgage holders could soon be offered their first rate cut in years as many have struggled with interest rates four per cent higher than when Labor was first elected.
The Reserve Bank of Australia will reveal whether it cuts interest rates or continues to hold them at 2.30pm (AEDT) on Tuesday after it has maintained the cash rate at 4.35 per cent since November 2023.
This comes after the RBA hiked rates 13 times from May 2022 to stamp out post-pandemic inflation.
The central bank’s board met on Monday and has reconvened on Tuesday for another four-hour meeting where they will determine their decision.
Most banks and financial institutions are predicting a 0.25 per cent cut after it was revealed inflation had continued to decline in the December quarter.
Trimmed mean inflation – the RBA’s preferred measure which examines the middle 70 per cent of price changes – dropped 0.4 per cent over the final three months of last year.
While it fell to 3.2 per cent, it is still outside of the RBA’s 2-3 per cent target range.
The central bank will also look at unemployment which remains towards record low levels.
The unemployment rate rose by 0.1 per cent in December to four per cent when 56,300 new jobs were created – far higher than market expectations.
Despite this, the market is overwhelmingly factoring in a 91 per cent chance of a drop.
Every major bank has predicted there will be a cut on Tuesday, while three of them are predicting a series of cuts throughout 2025.
Commonwealth Bank of Australia and Westpac both forecast the cash rate to hit 3.35 per cent by December, while NAB said it will hit 3.10 per cent by February.
ANZ is less optimistic than its main competitors, predicting the cash rate will hit 3.85 per cent by August.
After inflation figures were published in late January, Sky News’ Political Editor Andrew Clennell said the RBA’s Governor Michele Bullock would be under pressure to cut rates.
“The pressure is now on Michelle Bullock to cut rates,” he said.
“If she gets up on February 18th and says, ‘Sorry, we're not quite there yet, unemployment's not high enough and I know (inflation is) almost within the (2-3 per cent) band but underlying inflation is 3.2 not 2.9’.
""What do you think most Australians are going to think and what do you think most headlines are going to be?”
The secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions Sally McManus on Tuesday called on the RBA to slash rates, arguing any other move would be a “dire mistake”.
“They would be harming working people, harming the real economy which is, of course, working people’s budgets,” Ms McManus told reporters.
“We are urging them to get with the program.”
Mortgage holders will also be looking towards the major banks to pass along this rate cut to millions of Aussie homeowners.
Households on the average loan of $642,000 with a variable interest rate of 6.3 per cent could find their repayments drop by $104 per month, according to new research from Compare the Market.
This would mean they are about $1,248 better off throughout the course of the year.
If the RBA cuts rates in line with how three major banks are predicting, households could wipe six years off the length of their loan if they keep up current repayments.
Comparison site Finder said mortgage holders who choose to reduce their payments could save an average of $4,830 this year, but those who have adjusted to the higher rates and can afford to continue paying at that level could benefit in the long term.
If they continue paying at this rate over the life of their 30-year mortgage, they would save $294,519 in interest while those who lower their repayments could save $143,593 - assuming there are no further rate changes.
Trimmed mean inflation has fallen from 6.8 per cent in December 2022 after soaring from the 1-2 per cent range in the second half of 2021.
This continues to hurt Aussies in their hip pocket as the cumulative impacts of post-pandemic inflation means everyday goods on average cost about 20 per cent more than in 2020.",SKY News,finance
Leading economist Sean Langcake urges caution from RBA on cash rate as millions of Aussies hope for relief,James Harrison,https://www.skynews.com.au/business/finance/leading-economist-sean-langcake-urges-caution-from-rba-on-cash-rate-as-millions-of-aussies-hope-for-relief/news-story/10d78ae2624f398cfaf7d646ad00a4de,"The Reserve Bank of Australia is in “wait and see mode” on interest rates and would be cutting in a “very unusual set of economic circumstances” if it provided households with relief on Tuesday, a leading economist has cautioned.
Aussie mortgage holders will be eagerly looking at the RBA’s Tuesday decision, with the bank potentially poised to cut rates for the first time since 2020.
This could mean much needed relief for millions of Australians as they struggle with high interest rates and the cumulative impacts of post-pandemic inflation.
After encouraging inflation data was published in January, every major bank now predicts there will be a rate cut while markets have overwhelmingly factored in a drop.
However, the head of macroeconomic forecasting at Oxford Economics Australia Sean Langcake has flagged doubts of an interest rate cut.
“I don't think they're going to,” Mr Langcake told Sky News when asked if there would be a fall.
“I think that they're going to be in wait and see mode for a little bit longer, but the one thing we do know is it's going to be an awfully tight call.”
He pointed to the unemployment level, which was at four per cent in December, and the annual services inflation of 4.3 per cent as reasons the RBA was unlikely to slash rates.
“I think we're in for a really interesting decision no matter what they do,” Mr Langcake said.
“If they do cut, it's a very unusual set of economic circumstances for them to be cutting in.
“They've never cut with the unemployment rate this low, nor with services inflation this high outside of the GFC (global financial crisis).”
While Mr Langcake doubted a cut would come on Tuesday, all four major banks are predicting multiple cuts throughout the year.
Commonwealth Bank of Australia and Westpac both forecast the cash rate to hit 3.35 per cent by December, while NAB said it will hit 3.10 per cent by February.
ANZ is less optimistic than its main competitors, predicting the cash rate will hit 3.85 per cent by August.
Homeowners and prospective buyers will also be looking at how rate cuts could impact house prices across the nation.
Angus Moore, a senior economist at REA Group, said Aussies would see house prices grow this year in an interview with Business Now.
“Once we get later in the year – once we’re expecting that we see a few cuts, three or four potentially by the end of the year – that’s going to make more of a difference for both existing mortgage holders… but also… for borrowing capacities and what prospective buyers are willing to pay,” he said.
Mr Moore pointed to simmering house prices in Melbourne and Sydney, which both experienced drops in the last few months of 2024.
Sydney and Melbourne prices continued to fall in January after plunging 1.4 per cent and 1.8 per cent respectively in the final three months of last year.
“If we look across the country, the past few months have seen pretty soft prices,” the REA economist said.
“Sydney and Melbourne have kind of been tracking sideways for the past six months and even some of the smaller capitals that have been seeing really strong growth throughout the first half or so of 2024, even there it looks like the momentum has come out of prices recently.”",SKY News,finance

Brook Kidd, 20, who moved to Queensland's Sunshine Coast with plans to explore Australia, told her 11,000 TikTok followers that she had decided to go back home to Canada.
Ms Kidd said the cost of day to day expenses, particularly rent and groceries, had made things difficult.
""This is honestly something that I never thought I would say, but I'm coming back home,"" she said.
""...The cost of everything in Australia is a lot. Rent is astronomical and so are groceries.
""Although the wage is better you do need a consistent job to keep you on your feet.""
The 20-year-old was baffled with the price of healthcare for foreigners.
“Healthcare, it's not as bad as most places but for foreigners it is pricey,” Ms Kidd said.
“If you are someone that needs consistent visits, just be prepared to spend a decent amount of money.”
Visitors who come to Australia and are not permanent residents are responsible for their own healthcare costs.
Ms Kidd admitted she should had known how expensive life in Australia would be before she arrived.
Many in the comments section left their sympathies for the Canadian.
“At least you tried it and realised it wasn’t for you, some people don’t even take that step to try,” one said.
prioritizing your mental and physical health is so frickin important before travelling/moving abroad. travel will always be there and it’s something i’m just now realizing. you cannot experience travelling to its fullest extent if you don’t get your mental health in check first #fyp #foryoupage #solotravel #traveltok #australia #workingvisa #workingholiday #traveltiktok #abroad
“It's sad what has happened to Australia. I always thought I would stay in Australia but now I can't wait to leave,” another added.
It comes after couple Hayley Banks and Cole Whiteside, a Canadian couple living on the Sunshine Coast, told SkyNews.com.au they found it challenging settling into Australia.
After living in Queensland for just over a year, Ms Banks said rent was astounding for the place she got in return, as she currently pays $620 a week in Currimundi.
She agreed with Ms Kidd that healthcare is much more expensive for foreigners, saying it is cheaper in Canada.
Ms Banks put rent and healthcare as her most expensive necessities.
“I have not gone to the dentist since being here and have no plans on going back because it is so expensive. It is so much more out of pocket,” she said.
The 22-year-old said the cost-of-living crisis keeps the couple on their feet having a strict budget of $200 a week for groceries.
“$200 a week for groceries seems like a lot, but it’s not. It goes so fast,” Ms Banks said.
“Bananas are so expensive here. That’s one thing Cole gets really mad about.”
The university student was shocked with the price of fuel in the country, claiming diesel and fuel was “definitely” much cheaper in Canada.
Ms Banks said it was “really hard” for her partner Cole to find a job in his mechanical field after applying endlessly when he arrived in the country.
“It took him exactly 12 months to get an apprenticeship. He applied for retail, restaurant work and bar work. He had a hard run finding his feet in Australia for the first year,” Ms Banks said.
Ms Banks is currently working at a café and studying primary education full time at the University of Sunshine Coast.
The one issue she is juggling with is the act of working and studying, claiming her university gives her limited class options to allow for a good study/work life balance.
“For me I need to work a minimum 30 hours a week and do all my study work, it would be nice if I could move some of my classes online,” Ms Banks said.
The one thing the Canadian couple agreed on is how beautiful the country they live in is, and they plan to stay around for a while to complete their TAFE and university courses in Queensland.",SKY News,finance

The market's financial position has been at the centre of public scrutiny in recent months, with the site recently failing to publish its FY 2024 results on time for the first time in its 30-year history.
“We are finalising the financial report with the appropriate level of due diligence – it will be lodged this quarter,” a spokesperson said in January.
Amid concerns about the market’s financial position, Sharvain Facades, a Sydney-headquartered firm that has helped design some of the city's most recognisable structures, including the Chau Chak Wing Building at UTS, entered administration earlier this month.
It comes just weeks after the company installed the final roof panel on the 200m long floating roof canopy.
Graeme Beattie, the managing principal of insolvency firm Worrells, was appointed administrator on March 4 and the first creditors' meeting was held last week.
Sharvain Facades' managing director Boris Kostura said the collapse was attributable to construction delays at the market, and cost blowouts from labour and material expenses.
“The perimeters, program and prices have changed far beyond what could have been anticipated,” Mr Kostura told The Sydney Morning Herald.
“We hung in for a very long time. It was simply not possible to complete such a complex project for the original budget.”
The new development - initially costed at $250 million - had been scheduled to open to the public in 2024.
Its opening date is now looking more likely for November 2025, with costs ballooning out to $836 million.
Construction giant Multiplex is behind the new building and in October extended Sharvain Facades a $16 million loan, which Mr Kostura has since said he regretted taking.
“Our intention was not to be a roadblock, but rather to be part of the solution,” he said.
Sydney Fish Market’s construction timeline was extended by COVID work restrictions, a crane falling over in 2023 and poor weather.
Construction on the development has resulted in losses for other subcontractors, reaching as high as $7 million.
The market’s 38 tenants are reportedly worried the new building will not have enough power to support their refrigeration needs and the logistics between transporting stock between the two buildings.
Multiplex said it is meeting with Worrells and the NSW Government, which owns the new building, to assess the impact of Sharvain Facades’ administration.
Prior to Sydney Fish Market failing to publish its 2024 financial year results on time, the company posted a $6.3 million loss in the 2023 financial year.",SKY News,finance
ANZ Chief Economist Richard Yetsenga warns Australia to be hit by Trump tariff policies regardless of exemption,Patrick Hannaford,https://www.skynews.com.au/business/finance/anz-chief-economist-richard-yetsenga-warns-australia-to-be-hit-by-trump-tariff-policies-regardless-of-exemption/news-story/a193a212d97297e295fcc40c26d1401e,"The chief economist at one of Australia’s big banks has issued a warning about the impact of Trump’s tariff policies, telling Sky News Australia they will harm Australia’s economy even if we receive an exemption.
The Albanese government is yet to be successful in its attempt to win an exemption from the US President’s massive 25 per cent tariffs on steel and aluminium, despite Australia being the only country not hit by tariffs during Trump’s first term.
But according to the ANZ’s chief economist, Richard Yetsenga, the only question was whether the tariffs impacted Australia’s economy directly or indirectly.
“I don't really have a view about whether the problem will be Australia being tariffed directly, or that we’ll be a small, open economy in a world which is being impacted by tariffs,” Mr Yetsenga said.
“Either way, there's a headwind coming down the pipe.”
The ANZ economist said the current Trump administration was turning out to be “fundamentally different” to his first term, particularly when it came to trade policy.
“The first one did largely focus on China. This one is focusing on trade on a much broader front, and really seems to be viewing tariffs as a revenue raising tool,” he said.
“The problem with that… is if you put tariffs on someone they typically retaliate back in some form.”
Mr Yetsenga said this meant the impact of the US tariffs were likely to be 50 to 100 per cent worse than the impact of Trump’s tariffs alone.
“That's impacting the global economy and reversing globalization,” he said.
“Rather than pushing prices down, it's pushing them up, and rather than pushing growth up, it's pushing growth down.
“That must impact Australia's outlook - I'm not particularly negative on Australia. I think there's enough tailwinds there, but this is a strategic shift we need to keep factoring into the outlook.""
The leading economist said it should be taken “as a given” that the US economy would be worse this year as a result of the tariffs.
“Let's look at the numbers. The US is about 25 per cent of world GDP… but because it runs quite a big trade deficit, it's more, its share of global demand is bigger than that. It's closer to 30 per cent,” he said
“So if the US is very much weaker, I think that's a challenge for the world. The question here is to what extent (and) which of Trump's objectives or measures will he really follow through with.”
However the ANZ chief economist suggested Trump might change his approach when his policies start harming the economy.
“He views bilateral trade balances as kind of a fairness measure on trade, and wants to try and balance some of those up. But he also views the equity market as an arbiter on the economy, and he wants that to do well,” he said.
“I don't think he can hit both of those objectives if he follows through on all his tariff commitments. I think he will have a problem with what financial markets in the US signal.
“I think ultimately Trump will prioritise that. He talks about a period of adjustment and the risk of recession. I think if we start to see developments that are genuinely in that direction, and we have some weaker data coming out of the US… I think you'll see Trump start to adjust his tariffs and just step back a bit.”",SKY News,finance
"Australia's 2026 growth forecast smashed, OECD reveals as US President Donald Trump's tariffs cause global upheaval",James Harrison,https://www.skynews.com.au/business/finance/australian-growth-slumps-amongst-worst-impacted-nations-by-tariffs/news-story/973598248cf96867e927eabd1cfdd704,"Australia is “vulnerable” from tariff-induced risks to Chinese growth, a leading economist has declared as new data showed Donald Trump’s market rocking tariffs will keep global inflation higher for longer and slash growth in the coming years.
This comes as Treasurer Jim Chalmers on Tuesday addressed reporters ahead of next week’s budget where he tore into the “unnecessary” levies.
A new Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) report projected lower growth across the world, with Australia suffering one of the worst blows amongst the group compared to forecasts delivered in December.
Australia is on track for growth of 1.9 per cent in 2025, up from 1.1 per cent last year, while projections for next year are 1.8 per cent, which is 0.7 per cent lower than the December forecast.
The nation’s 2026 downgrade makes it the third worst slump behind Mexico and Canada which will both be directly impacted by the US President’s 25 per cent tariffs.
Canada will experience back-to-back growth of 0.7 per cent over the next two years, a 1.3 per cent downgrade for each year, while Mexico’s forecasts have dropped 2.5 and 2.2 per cent respectively.
The chief economist at AMP Shane Oliver told SkyNews.com.au the risk to Australia’s economy from the tariffs was through flow on effects of the 20 per cent tariffs Trump has slapped on Chinese-made goods.
“There’s a risk to Chinese growth from these tariffs and a trade war flowing from that. That’s where Australia is vulnerable and that’s largely why the OECD has revised our forecast,” Mr Oliver said.
“If we didn’t have the uncertainty around Trump and his trade war then we probably would have been looking at much better growth.”
Backing in Mr Oliver's point was Michael Fingland, the CEO of consultancy business Vantage Performance, who said Australia faces ""indirect fallout"" from US-China trade frictions and potential spillovers affecting North American economies.
""Even before the tariffs, China’s demand for iron ore was already slowing,"" Mr Fingland told SkyNews.com.au.
Australia is directly impacted by 25 per cent tariffs on steel and aluminium, however, Mr Chalmers on Tuesday said the direct hit to the nation’s GDP would be less than 0.02 per cent by 2030.
But he stressed the indirect effects would pose a 0.1 per cent hit by 2030.
“Over a range of scenarios, Treasury found the indirect GDP impacts of a trade war could be up to four times larger than the direct effects of tariffs on our economy,” Mr Chalmers said.
Mr Oliver stressed the tariff setback to Australia’s growth was “not disastrous” as the nation is on track to perform better than in 2024.
“Last year our economy only grew 1.1 per cent so we’re talking about 1.8 per cent in 2026, it’s still an improvement on last year and likewise for the global economy,” he said.
Headline inflation in Australia is expected to drop within the RBA’s 2-3 per cent target band over 2025 and 2026, however, the OECD said “heightened political uncertainty” and further trade disruption means inflation could fall slower than expected.
“Increasing trade restrictions will contribute to higher costs both for production and consumption,” OECD secretary-general and former finance minister Mathias Cormann said.
“It remains essential to ensure a well-functioning, rules-based international trading system and to keep markets open.”
The OECD could further downgrade Australia's 2026 growth forecast if the trade war were to intensify or if domestic inflation stayed ""stickier than expected"", Mr Fingland said.
""The cost-of-living crisis is really hurting a lot of families, so discretionary spending will remain subdued for some time,"" he said.
Trump’s tariffs were criticised by Mr Chalmers on Tuesday as he prepares to hand down his fourth budget in a week’s time.
“In a world of retaliation and escalation, the impacts of tariffs are amplified, they linger for longer, resulting in a bigger reduction in GDP and a bigger increase in prices,” the Treasurer said.
Australia could face further tariffs outside of the current 25 per cent tax on aluminum and steel in Trump’s next series of trade taxes with the nation’s beef and pharmaceuticals exposed, according to The Australian Financial Review.
Tariffs of between two and eight per cent could be slapped on an array of Australia’s $30b of exports sold to the United States.
Mr Chalmers was questioned about this report during an appearance on ABC Radio National where he said it “remains to be seen”.
“Obviously there's a lot of discussion in both countries and around the world about what the next steps may look like in terms of trade policy out of the US,” he said.
He also described the tariffs as “self-defeating … self-sabotaging” and a “recipe for less growth and higher inflation” across the globe.
“That's one of the reasons why the OECD overnight downgraded their expectations for growth, because of these trade barriers and this escalation of trade tensions,” Mr Chalmers said.
“It's very concerning to us as a trade exposed country, and that's why we engage where we can in the most meaningful way we can to put Australia's case.”
Mr Chalmers has warned ex-tropical Cyclone Alfred will cost the Australian economy at least $1.2 billion.
The hit will further compound pressures on inflation and the federal budget in the lead-up to election, to be held on or before May 17.",SKY News,finance
ACCC's Gina Cass-Gottlieb vows to crackdown on anti-competitive behaviour worsening cost of living pressures in 2025,James Harrison,https://www.skynews.com.au/business/finance/acccs-gina-cassgottlieb-vows-to-crackdown-on-anticompetitive-behaviour-worsening-cost-of-living-pressures-in-2025/news-story/4d75c2fdd0dc02020a4ac7aaeeb759e2,"The consumer watchdog has vowed to crackdown on anti-competitive behaviour causing many Aussies to further tighten their belts amid stringent price pressures.
In an address to the Committee for Economic Development of Australia, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission’s chair Gina Cass-Gottlieb gave insight to the agency’s top priorities going into 2025.
“Consumers are still doing it tough, and the cost of groceries and essential services have contributed to significant cost of living stress,” she said.
“We will continue to work hard to protect consumers by using the full range of our tools and powers to enhance competition and fair trading, through tough and rigorous enforcement as well as targeted compliance and education initiatives.”
The ACCC in September announced it was suing Woolworths and Coles for allegedly misleading customers on items listed as discounted, which both supermarket giants have denied.
It led the government to inject $30m into the watchdog as it looks to crack down on “unconscionable conduct”.
Ms Cass-Gottlieb referenced this in her speech and said the ACCC was investigating competition and consumer concerns in the supermarket and retail sector.
The watchdog also noted concerns about market concentration in a litany of other industries including aviation and digital platforms.
Qantas and Virgin Australia continue to make up about 95 per cent of Australia’s domestic aviation market, which has grown since budget carrier Bonza went under and Rex exited the major city routes last year.
Meanwhile, the ACCC has flagged concerns about Google entering exclusive agreements with Telstra, Optus and TPG to exclusively pre-install Google Search as the default option on Android devices these telcos sell.
Essential services sectors including telecommunications companies, electricity providers and gas companies will also come under the ACCC’s microscope over the coming year.
Card surcharging, which Labor has vowed to take action on, will also be a high priority focus for the watchdog as many companies and bodies call for further transparency into the add-on costs.
“In the year ahead, our work will focus on increasing business compliance with the excessive card payment surcharging prohibition, and improving pricing practices to ensure all add on costs are appropriately disclosed,” Ms Cass-Gottlieb said.
The ACCC said it received about 2,500 reports of businesses allegedly imposing illegal card surcharges in 2024.
Ms Cass-Gottlieb stressed the importance of tackling anti-competitive practices in the year ahead as the watchdog looks to foster “economic dynamism and growth” in Australia’s markets.
“When markets are not workably competitive, Australian customers, whether consumers or businesses, pay the price,” she said.
“When businesses compete with each other to meet consumer needs, they are incentivised to innovate and improve, to offer greater choice, lower prices and better quality products and services that deliver value for the money consumers choose to spend.”",SKY News,finance
"Just one in three lenders have announced they will pass on the RBA's interest rate cut, Finder research reveals",James Harrison,https://www.skynews.com.au/business/finance/shockingly-low-number-of-lenders-have-announced-they-will-pass-on-the-rbas-interest-rate-cut/news-story/1b745c933f288f65994baf2a2944b0d9,"Just one in three lenders have passed on the long-awaited interest rate cut handed down by the Reserve Bank of Australia on Tuesday, new research has revealed.
The RBA cut the cash rate by 25 basis points earlier this week, bringing it down to 4.10 per cent in welcome news for millions of Aussies struggling with price pressures.
It follows the central bank holding the rate at 4.35 per cent since November 2023 after it hiked interest rates 13 times over about a year and a half.
This meant many families were paying $26,000 to $50,000 more than they would have prior to the hikes.
Shortly after the RBA handed down its decision, the four major banks ANZ, NAB, Westpac and Commonwealth Bank announced they would pass on the cut to its customers, taking anywhere from 10 to 17 days to come into effect.
This delay alone could cost Aussies roughly $92m in interest, according to comparison site Finder.
However not all banks were as quick to announce rate cuts, with the head of consumer research at Finder Graham Cooke arguing that mortgage holders have a right to be upset if their lender is not passing on the cut.
“Every extra day without a cut leaves many Aussie homeowners with tighter budgets,” Mr Cooke said in a statement.
“If your bank isn’t looking out for you when all eyes are on an RBA cut, when will it?”
The big four banks collectively hold about $1.5 trillion in owner-occupied mortgages, making up about 72 per cent of the market, Finder said.
Households on the average home loan of $641,416 could save about $103 per month if the rate cut is passed on.
Three of the big four banks are predicting the RBA will cuts rates by a full per cent over 2025.
Commonwealth Bank of Australia and Westpac both forecast the cash rate to hit 3.35 per cent by December, while NAB said it will hit 3.10 per cent by February.
ANZ is less optimistic than its main competitors, predicting the cash rate will hit 3.85 per cent by August.
However, the RBA poured cold water on that prospect after the rate cut was revealed.
""If monetary policy is eased too much too soon, disinflation could stall, and inflation would settle above the midpoint of the target range,"" the bank said in a statement.
""In removing a little of the policy restrictiveness in its decision today, the Board acknowledges that progress has been made but is cautious about the outlook.""
RBA Governor Michele Bullock reiterated the central bank's caution towards declaring ""victory on inflation"" as price pressures continued to impact Aussies.
""It's not good enough for it to be back in the (2-3 per cent) target range temporarily, the board needs to be confident it's returning to the target range sustainably,"" Ms Bullock told reporters on Tuesday.",SKY News,finance
Commerce secretary Howard Lutnick shares Donald Trump's 'goal' to abolish the IRS,Unknown,https://www.skynews.com.au/business/finance/commerce-secretary-howard-lutnick-shares-donald-trumps-goal-to-abolish-the-irs/news-story/ff618f9af825dc9e49ce5ae0ab5c2c99,"More details have emerged from the Trump administration about alleged plans to get rid of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and utilize tariffs so the ""whole economy explodes.""
""His goal is to abolish the Internal Revenue Service and let all the outsiders pay,"" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Wednesday on ""Jesse Watters Primetime.""
""As the president said, reciprocal tariffs, either you bring yours down or we're going to bring ours up. If we go to their level, it will earn us $700 billion a year to be equal to everybody else,"" he expanded Thursday on ""America’s Newsroom.""
""And there goes our deficit. And interest rates come smashing down, and the whole economy explodes higher.""
Last month, President Donald Trump announced a new ""External Revenue Service"" that would be tasked with collecting revenue from tariffs, and potentially replace the IRS as America has been ""taxing ourselves.""
Trump has boasted about bringing the U.S. economy back to a ""golden age,"" prior to 1913 when the federal income tax was created, where government funding primarily came from tariffs — though economists have questioned whether this approach is feasible in modern times.
Lutnick provided multiple examples of profitable tariff use to Watters: ""Cruise ships — you ever see a cruise ship with an American flag on the back? They have flags of, like, Liberia or Panama. None of them pay taxes… Every supertanker, none pays taxes. Alcohol, all foreign alcohol, no taxes. This is going to end under Donald Trump.""
""And those taxes are going to be paid and Americans' tax rates are going to come down,"" he added. ""That's what Donald Trump wants to do, balance our budget and cut our taxes.""
Tariffs are taxes on imports, which in most cases are paid by the U.S.-based importer to an existing federal agency, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP).
The U.S., Canada and Mexico came to an agreement before a 25% tariff went into effect, and a current across-the-board tariff has been placed on Chinese exports.
""We've got the power. We've got to use tariffs. We've got to use the External Revenue Service to take care of America and cut the scams and the abuse, the waste. And let's make America great,"" Lutnick also told Watters.
""We mean 'great' by saying no deficit and, basically, try to eliminate the Internal Revenue Service and our taxes. Cut taxes, try, try to get them down because we're great, and we collect the money.""

"April interest rate cut unlikely as January unemployment data comes in at 4.1 per cent, meeting market expectations",James Harrison,https://www.skynews.com.au/business/finance/april-interest-rate-cut-unlikely-as-january-unemployment-data-comes-in-at-41-per-cent-meeting-market-expectations/news-story/daa054185ed3bbacefa6df75d7769c1d,"Aussies hoping for a second interest rate cut in April have been let down as the unemployment rate rose by 0.1 per cent in January, as the rate stays near historic lows.
New data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics has revealed the number of unemployed people rose by 23,000 in January while the number of employed Aussies was up by 44,000 - meeting market expectations of 4.1 per cent.
The participation rate was up to a new high of 67.3 per cent which was almost a full percent above the January 2024 level.
Unemployment data is closely examined by the Reserve Bank of Australia when it determines its call on interest rates.
Sky News’ Business Editor Ross Greenwood predicted the RBA would “feel pretty neutral” when it examined the new unemployment data and would not cut in the lead up to the election.
“As indicated when the Reserve Bank cut interest rates on Tuesday, it was almost taking itself out of the election campaign,” Greenwood said.
“I would expect the Reserve Bank from here, even with these numbers, to be almost silent during the entire election campaign.
“The reason for that is there is not much of a reason for them now economically to come out and make any big statements about future monetary policy.”
Following the release of the unemployment data, the market has factored in an 88 per cent chance of rates remaining on hold in April.
Greenwood said interest rates were ""probably going to be on hold well after the election is run and won and done"".
Backing in Greenwood’s sentiment was Abhijit Surya, senior APAC economist at Capital Economics, who predicted the central bank will continue to approach future rate calls cautiously.
“Today’s data release will likely reinforce the RBA’s view that it needs to be cautious about any further policy normalisation,” Mr Surya said.
“We expect the Bank to cut rates only twice more over its easing cycle this year.”
Krishna Bhimavarapu, APAC economist State Street Global Advisors, similarly predicted two more rate cuts in 2025 and said the data was unlikely to impact forecasts on rate cuts.
“It is unlikely that this data would affect the easing outlook on the cash rate,” Mr Bhimavarapu said.
“We still expect two more cuts this year taking the rate to 3.60 per cent.”
Thursday's unemployment figure was heavily influenced by changes for female representation in the workforce.
Bjorn Jarvis, the ABS' head of labour statistics, said the shift in female representation against male representation was significant.
“Most of the rise in both employment and unemployment in January reflected rises for women, with female employment rising by 44,000 and unemployment by 24,000,” Mr Jarvis said in a statement.
“In contrast, male employment and unemployment both changed by less than 1,000 people.”
Alongside this, the employment-to-population ratio rose 0.1 per cent to a new record of 64.6 per cent.
This change, underpinned by the change in female representation, was 0.8 per cent higher than a year ago and 2.4 percentage points higher than before the COVID-19 pandemic.",SKY News,finance
Kochie claims US President Donald Trump's tariffs 'rampage' could kill future interest rate cuts after RBA lowered rates,James Harrison,https://www.skynews.com.au/business/finance/kochie-claims-us-president-donald-trumps-tariffs-rampage-could-kill-future-interest-rate-cuts-after-rba-lowered-rates/news-story/1579714b130200f153236932b7b868b3,"David Koch has claimed United States President Donald Trump’s tariff “rampage” could dampen hopes of future rate cuts after mortgage holders were given their first fall since 2020.
The former Sunrise host noted that President Trump’s protectionist economic policies, which target aluminium and steel imports alongside goods from China, Mexico and Canada, would be inflationary.
This comes as the Reserve Bank of Australia on Tuesday noted that inflation had eased “a little more quickly than expected”, but added it was still cautiously monitoring future price pressures after delivering a rate cut.
Kochie said the RBA was not convinced there would be multiple rate cuts throughout 2025, as three major banks have forecasted, due to concerns inflation could return.
“They went out of their way to say there is a high risk that inflation could come back,” he told SkyNews.com.au.
“We're in a world of Trumpism at the moment with protecting borders (and) increasing tariffs.”
He added that RBA Governor Michele Bullock had vocalised concerns about how the tariffs could impact inflation and possibly stall future rate cuts.
“If he goes on this rampage of increasing tariffs around the world (then) increasing tariffs lead to inflation, leads to higher prices, feeds into the inflation wheel again and that's what Michele Bullock and Reserve Bank board are really concerned about,” Kochie said.
“We're going into uncharted economic waters here and markets hate uncertainty.
“The problem with Trump is we're in a world of uncertainty.
“Every morning you wake up to an economic reality show that there's some new episode that just makes you shake your head, and he changes decisions quickly. I think that is what is concerning the Reserve Bank.”
Ms Bullock told reporters on Tuesday that President Trump’s trade war was “uncertain” and “unpredictable”, limiting the central bank in how it can forecast the future of Australia’s economy.
“We don’t know exactly what’s going to happen, so we can’t make specific plans,” she said.
“What we probably can say is that in a particularly bad case, it would be bad for economic activity around the world and possibly China, and that wouldn’t be good for us.
“What it means for inflation is slightly different because it could mean higher inflation in some countries due to tariffs. So it very much depends on how it plays out in terms of what actually gets implemented, and then how people respond to those things.”
President Trump last week said he will give “great consideration” to a tariff exemption for Australian aluminium and steel after having a phone call with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.
American importers will be forced to pay a 25 per cent tax on the Australians metals from March 12, unless the US President gives Australia an exemption.
Australia could also be indirectly impacted by President Trump’s tariffs on China if its economy slows down and reduces demand for local goods.",SKY News,finance
"Pre-election cash splashes, quick fixes stirs budget concerns from Deloitte Access Economics as sea of deficits loom",James Harrison,https://www.skynews.com.au/business/finance/preelection-cash-splashes-quick-fixes-stirs-budget-concerns-from-deloitte-access-economics-as-sea-of-deficits-loom/news-story/059676811c2b5f9dc7c341bac8b4e63c,"Pre-election “sweeteners” and Australia’s forecasted long term budget hole have stirred concern for the nation’s fiscal position as a leading economist has warned “ineffective spending is the last thing Australia needs”.
After posting back-to-back surpluses, Labor is expected to reveal a deficit of $26.1b in the coming budget and revenue downgrades of $11.3b over the coming four years, according to Deloitte Access Economics.
The major consulting firm predicts the coming deficit is an $800m better result than Labor’s mid-year economic forecast as it has been forecasted the nation will not return to surplus for a decade.
But Australia’s bottom line is set to suffer as spending pressures across key areas like aged care, the NDIS and defence escalate, leading to a $13.1b blow out over the coming four years.
This would push net debt to 23.9 per cent of gross domestic product in 2027-28 from about 19.6 per cent during this financial year.
Deloitte’s report points to pre-election spending sprees from either party in bids to woo voters in a battle likely to result in a minority government.
Stephen Smith, a partner at Deloitte Access Economics and co-author of the report, warned structural challenges in the economy cannot be solved with quick fixes and called for careful spending.
“It is critical that each new dollar of spending is delivering value for money. Unfortunately, in the lead up to a federal election, that is not the case,” Mr Smith said.
“Value for money can be hard to come by in election years. But the long-term budget projections show deficits as far as the eye can see, and ineffective spending is the last thing Australia needs.”
Labor has announced it will put forward $16b to wipe 20 per cent off all current HECS debts if elected, while it has pledged $8.5b for Medicare, $7.2b for the Bruce Highway, $2.4b for the Whyalla Steelworks and an extra $4.8b for NSW Public Schools over 10 years.
The Coalition has exceeded Labor’s Medicare pledge by $500m, while it has matched the Whyalla bailout and Bruce Highway upgrades and announced $3b for fighter jets.
Cathryn Lee, a partner at Deloitte Access Economics and co-author of the report, stressed ongoing financial challenges plaguing the government will be inherited by a future government and hoped this would spark “meaningful proposals to put Australia on a firmer fiscal footing”.
“Unfortunately, the election is more likely to put an outsized focus on flashy proposals designed to woo voters who are focused on their day to day,” Ms Lee said.
“This will distract from a pressing policy issue facing the nation: the fiscal holes in Australia’s medium-term budget outlook are getting bigger, not smaller.
“And no politician is putting forward a credible plan to plug those holes.”
She said the path back to surplus will “require hard decisions” such as how to pay for the litany of costly election promises.
“Today, the Australian conversation about the right level of revenue and the right mix of taxes is barely a murmur,” Ms Lee said.
“It’s an increasingly important conversation for the nation’s future, and the volume needs to be turned all the way up.”
Concerns about budget blow outs come as Treasurer Jim Chalmers warned ex-tropical Cyclone Alfred will cost the Australian economy at least $1.2 billion.
The hit will further compound pressures on inflation and the federal budget in the lead-up to election, to be held on or before May 17.
Mr Chalmers revealed the substantial blow to the nation's economy at a press conference in Brisbane on Monday.
“We have been primarily focused throughout on the human cost of these natural disasters, but there will be a very substantial economic cost as well,” Mr Chalmers said.
“Recovering and rebuilding from natural disasters will be a key influence on the budget that (Finance Minister) Katy Gallagher and I will hand down in eight days' time.
“Treasury expects there will be about a $1.2 billion hit to economic output, just as a consequence of ex-TC Alfred.”",SKY News,finance
"Private health benefits slumped to record low level in 2024 as Aussies were forced to fork out $1.37b, new data reveals",James Harrison,https://www.skynews.com.au/business/finance/private-health-benefits-slumped-to-record-low-level-in-2024-as-aussies-were-forced-to-fork-out-137b-new-data-reveals/news-story/60eb40d706e179dfa9eb2b256c1f41e2,"Private health insurance benefits hit record lows as Aussies were forced to pay $1.37b in medical costs last year, new research has revealed.
Private health funds only reimbursed 66.7 per cent of medical costs after coverage from Medicare in 2024 — the lowest level since records began in 2008, according to analysis of Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority data by money.com.au.
This is a huge drop from just five years ago when private health funds covered 75.7 per cent of medical bills after Medicare contributions while they covered 70.7 per cent in 2008.
Money.com.au’s general manager of health insurance, Chris Whitelaw, said this revelation showed Australia is facing a private health insurance “crisis”.
""The gap between what insurers should be covering and what they actually cover is growing,” Mr Whitelaw said.
“Five years ago, private health funds picked up three-quarters of the bill after Medicare — now, it’s closer to two-thirds.”
He said many Aussies were taking out private health insurance expecting to be protected but they were “left holding the bag”.
“Medical costs are rising, health insurance coverage is shrinking, and patients are paying the price — all while premiums keep going up each year,” Mr Whitelaw said.
Medical costs increased by nine per cent last year while Medicare rose about eight per cent and private health benefits were up 7.1 per cent.
However, “both have failed to keep up”, money.com.au said as it led “to a 15.4 per cent rise in out-of-pocket costs last year — a record high”.
Aussies paid $779m out of pocket five years ago and $523m in 2008, the comparison site said.
Despite the cost increases, the percentage of Aussies with private health cover has increased from 44 per cent to 45.2 per cent over the past five years.
Money.com.au said this showed rising out-of-pocket costs are due to increasing medical expenses while Medicare and health funds cover a smaller chunk of the bill.
These revelations about health insurance come as Labor in February approved an industry average premium increase of 3.73 per cent with Health Minister Mark Butler arguing the increase was a “justified and proportionate” rise.
The jump, which comes into effect from April 1, marks the largest increase in seven years and comes above inflation which was 2.5 per cent in the 12 months to January.",SKY News,finance
Major inflation warning from Sky News' Ross Greenwood as Tropical Cyclone Alfred threatens vital Lockyer Valley Region,James Harrison,https://www.skynews.com.au/business/finance/major-inflation-warning-from-sky-news-ross-greenwood-as-tropical-cyclone-alfred-threatens-vital-lockyer-valley-region/news-story/b45f42b6d4151a9183591b6fe96420ae,"Aussies could be plagued by a spike in inflation as the wild weather from Tropical Cyclone Alfred may impact a vital Queensland farming region.
The slow-moving cyclone continues to hover off the coast of Queensland and northern NSW as concerns mount about the impact of this wild weather event when it hits the coast, which is expected either later Friday or early Saturday.
As Queensland and Northern New South Wales residents prepare for the looming threat of Tropical Cyclone Alfred over the coming days, Sky News Weather brings you a special report on what to expect, which locations will be hit hardest and a detailed explainer on how cyclones work. Watch ‘Prepare for Impact: Tropical Cyclone Alfred’ now.
Sky News’ Business Editor Ross Greenwood warned the cyclone could impact the Lockyer Valley Region, a rich farming region to the west of Brisbane labelled “Australia’s Salad Bowl”.
“This could have a big impact on even the national economy,” Greenwood warned.
The valley produces about 40 per cent of Queensland’s fruit and vegetables and grows more than 95 per cent of all winter crops in Australia.
Greenwood noted this area was one of the “most prosperous fruit and vegetable growing areas” in the nation and warned about financial ramifications from the cyclone’s devastation.
“If all of a sudden Australia has a lack of fruit and vegetables off the back of this disaster, then that could spike up inflation (and) could certainly spike up the price of fruit and vegetables for the whole of Australia,” he said.
The cyclone could create a knock on for the Australian economy just as the nation starts to see some economic recovery after post-pandemic inflation forced Aussies to slash their budgets.
It comes as inflation has dropped back into its two-three per cent target range after peaking at more than seven per cent in December 2022, while the Reserve Bank of Australia lowered the cash rate about three weeks ago after keeping it on hold for almost a year and a half.
“This is the sort of thing that takes you backwards for a period of time,” Greenwood said.
“The rebuilding effort - when all that money comes out of the insurers - is an issue. Australians right now understand that insurance policies have gone up a lot in recent times.
“Guess what happens when you have massive claims such as this?
“The insurance companies, their profits go, (and) a lot of people become uninsured and insurance premiums ultimately go up again.”
Greenwood said another “big issue” was for those who had recently purchased homes in the impacted areas and struggled to secure insurance.
“They're being knocked back for that insurance at the moment and the reason for that is because you can't suddenly get an insurance policy day and then make a massive claim tomorrow if the cyclone comes through and wipes you out,” he said.
Similarly, insurance expert Marty Sadlier warned Queensland and New South Wales property owners were in for “devastating” insurance challenges once Tropical Cyclone Alfred had passed.
“The insurance crisis hitting this country has been fermenting for some years now, yet it’s only when events such as this cyclone hit that the consequences come into sharp focus,” Mr Sadlier said.
The cyclone came to a ""near staggering halt"" off the coast of Queensland, sparking concerns the delay could make the storm more powerful.
The details of exactly where and when Tropical Cyclone Alfred will hit have been constantly changing as the massive and destructive weather system moves closer to the Queensland coast.",SKY News,finance
"Australia's major banks, airlines exposed for huge gender pay gaps in bombshell report from Workplace Gender Equality Agency",James Harrison,https://www.skynews.com.au/business/finance/australias-major-banks-airlines-exposed-for-huge-gender-pay-gaps-in-bombshell-report-from-workplace-gender-equality-agency/news-story/c9e8c9f91be468e3cb7d341189f5419a,"Major Australian companies have been exposed as new data revealed wide gender pay gaps with men taking home almost $30,000 more than their female co-workers.
The Workplace Gender Equality Agency on Tuesday published its Employer Gender Pay Gaps Report for the 2023-24 financial year where the disparities between men’s and women’s total remuneration, which includes salary, bonuses and superannuation, came under the microscope.
While 56 per cent of employers improved their gender pay gaps between now and last year’s data, 79 per cent are still outside the +/-5 per cent target range.
The average remuneration from WGEA's data looks at full time, part time and casual employees and does not account for hours worked.
The male-dominated construction industry led the pay gap with a 25.3 per cent divide while the Financial and Insurance Services sector (22.2 per cent) and the Rental, Hiring and Real Estate Services industry (21.2 per cent) followed.
Australian property company Goodman Group was one of the worst offenders with a 66.4 per cent pay gap while the Brisbane Broncos reported a hefty 66.9 per cent disparity.
The major four Australian banks, which collectively employ about 150,000 workers, were also well outside the target range.
The ASX's largest company, Commonwealth Bank, reported a 22.3 per cent gap while Westpac (22.4 per cent) posted the largest pay gap out of the major banks.
Speaking on the results, CommBank said it had achieved “pay equity on a ‘like for like basis’” to ensure workers were paid equally for work of equal value.
Meanwhile, NAB and ANZ both reported pay gaps of about 19 per cent.
WGEA's report found that women were pocketing 78 cents for every dollar their male counterparts took home, totalling a $28,425 difference per year for the average worker.
WGEA’s chief executive Mary Wooldridge said that pay differences outside the target range indicated that one gender was more likely to be over-represented in higher paying roles compared to the other.
“This can be a sign of structural or cultural differences for one gender within an occupation, organisation, or broader industry,” Ms Wooldridge said in a statement.
“For employers that haven’t made progress, it’s time to ask why – dig into the data to find out what’s causing any gender differences and use evidence-based solutions to address them.”
She noted the drop in pay disparities compared to last year came as many companies anticipated the publication of these results and “generated positive flow on effects”.
Qantas Airways Limited, which includes the national carrier and its budget subsidiary Jetstar, had a whopping 41.2 per cent pay gap despite women making up 44 per cent of the company.
Women were greatly underrepresented in the upper portion of earners with just 12 per cent of female staffers at the airline group in this top bracket where the average worker took home $287,000 in remuneration.
The company’s Chief People Officer Catherine Walsh said Qantas saw a five per cent drop in its gender pay gap and lauded its proportionally higher representation of female pilots compared to the wider industry.
“At Qantas 7.5 per cent of pilots are women, which is above the global industry average of 4 per cent. The figures are similar for our engineering teams, with 4.3 per cent women, slightly above the global average around 3 per cent,” Ms Walsh said in a statement.
Qantas’ main competitor Virgin Australia was worse off with a 45.2 per cent average gap between male and female workers.
Virgin said this gap was driven by the “demographic profile” of the company with a larger proportion of men occupying higher paying roles like pilots and engineers.
The mining sector had about a 19.8 per cent gap, however, giants Origin (16.9 per cent), BHP (11.2 per cent) and Fortescue (10.4 per cent) all fell below this.
Media and telecommunications companies also struggled with pay disparities between men and women, though the industry average of 12.1 per cent fell below the national.
Men at Nine Entertainment earnt 17 per cent more than their female counterparts while male staffers at the company’s main competitor Seven West Media took home almost 14 per cent more.
Nationwide News, which owns Sky News Australia's parent company Australian News Channel, had an overall gap of 10.5 per cent while ANC's was 11.1 per cent, which is slightly under the industry benchmark of 11.2 per cent.
Meanwhile, Telstra’s gap was 13.3 per cent while Optus' was a touch lower at 11.8 per cent.
The supermarket sector was milder with Woolworths reporting a 10.5 per cent gap, Coles at 6.1 per cent and Endeavour Group, the owner of Dan Murphy’s and BWS, at 3.3 per cent.
Ms Wooldridge said that many employers had told WGEA that publishing the gender pay gaps had been a “catalyst to assess gender-based differences in all areas of their workplace”.
“For men, a more equal experience could mean their employer is providing access to paid parental leave, paying superannuation on that leave and actively supporting a flexible return to work from parental leave,” she said.
“For women, it could mean their employer is redesigning manager roles that will enable those roles to be undertaken on a part-time basis or as a job share.
“This action can create new pathways to career progression for employees with caring or other responsibilities outside of work, or by actively broadening the pipeline of talent across occupations and job roles.”
Tuesday’s report marks the second year WGEA has published this employer data.
Last year, WGEA only released the median total remuneration for companies.",SKY News,finance
AustralianSuper fined $27m by ASIC for charging duplicate fees to members with multiple accounts over decade-long period,James Harrison,https://www.skynews.com.au/business/finance/australiansuper-fined-27m-by-asic-for-charging-duplicate-fees-to-members-with-multiple-accounts-over-decadelong-period/news-story/ba57164645053d382ef7f7e29f3ff268,"The nation’s largest super fund has been fined $27 million after the Federal Court found it charged duplicate fees to tens of thousands of its customers over the span of a decade.
AustralianSuper was taken to court by the Australia Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) in 2023 for charging these fees.
This resulted in about 90,000 members with more than one account paying fees and premiums on each one, costing a collective $69m between July 2013 and March 2023.
It was found the super fund’s processes to detect and combine multiple accounts held by a member were not up to standard.
This issue was self-reported in 2021, which came as a point of concern for ASIC as it was first identified in 2018.
Despite AustralianSuper self-reporting the issue, ASIC proceeded with legal action anyhow as it felt the three year gap between becoming aware of the issue and reporting it was lacklustre.
ASIC’s deputy chair Sarah Court flagged concerns about the major super fund’s conduct when the case was originally filed.
“ASIC expects that superannuation funds will put their members first and promptly address issues that cause members to face multiple sets of fees and insurance premiums,” Ms Court said when the case was filed.
“We expect these issues to be identified and rectified quickly, including compensating members if a trustee has failed to comply with its obligations.”
AustralianSuper’s chief executive Paul Schroder on Friday said the company has rectified the issue with its customers when making an apology.
“We found this mistake, we reported it, we apologised to impacted members, we compensated them, and we’ve improved our processes to prevent this happening again,” Mr Schroder said in a statement.
""Multiple member accounts are a problem across our industry and for several years our process wasn’t comprehensive enough to meet our obligations to members.
“We've fixed that now and we continue to review and improve our services, so we provide members with the support and guidance they expect and deserve.”
Alongside the eight figure fine, AustralianSuper will also pay ASIC’s legal costs, though this is capped at $500,000.
In its 2024 financial year report, AustralianSuper said it manages over $340 billion on behalf of 3.4 million members.",SKY News,finance
At least five million Aussies to receive cash bump as Labor's latest round of social security indexation arrives next week,James Harrison,https://www.skynews.com.au/business/finance/at-least-five-million-aussies-to-receive-cash-bump-as-labors-latest-round-of-social-security-indexation-arrives-next-week/news-story/5737c4a1eaf6ce9bd2b129caab07ff24,"At least five million Aussies receiving Centrelink payments will get a payment boost through the latest round of indexation.
Payments such as Jobseeker, the age pension, and rent assistance will increase from March 20 in one of the government’s biannual social security payment bumps, which aim to mitigate the impacts of inflation.
It comes as price pressures have simmered over the past year, but the cumulative impact of post-pandemic inflation still hurts the most vulnerable Aussies in the hip pockets.
Social Services Minister Amanda Rishworth said Labor had spent the past three years “strengthening” social security to help Australians “at whatever age or stage they’re at in life”.
“Indexation is a critical part of our social security safety net. For pensioners and other payment recipients receiving this financial boost, this will help ease some pressure,” Ms Rishworth said.
Those on the maximum rate for the Age Pension, Disability Support Pension and Carer Payment will have their payments increased by $4.60 to $1149.00 a fortnight.
Couples on the maximum rate of pension will increase by $7 a fortnight to $866.10 each or $1732.20 per couple.
Single parents will get an extra $4 per fortnight, while those on Jobseeker without children will get a $3.10 increase and couples will get a $2.80 bump.
About 2.6 million Australians are on the aged pension while 850,000 people receive JobSeeker.
Labor has invested about $11.5 billion into the nation's social safety net across the past two budgets.
The government said a single pensioner will be receiving more than $3913 additional per year from its indexation, while pensioner couples received $5902 extra per year.
This indexation comes as total inflation since Labor came to power has increased about 10 per cent as global market conditions have impacted Aussie households.",SKY News,finance
Mark Bouris argues govt did nothing to lower interest rates following Treasurer Jim Chalmers praise for Labor’s efforts,Amy Roulston,https://www.skynews.com.au/business/finance/mark-bouris-argues-govt-did-nothing-to-lower-interest-rates-following-treasurer-jim-chalmers-praise-for-labors-efforts/news-story/79bfce2a4cb4eb9332f690c7970b1708,"Wizard Home Loans founder Mark Bouris has argued both state and federal levels of Australian government had nothing to do with the Reserve Bank of Australia lowering interest rates, despite Treasurer Jim Chalmers commending Labor’s economic progress.
The Reserve Bank of Australia lowered interest rates by 0.25 per cent on Tuesday, marking the first reduction since 2020.
The cash rate was held at 4.35 per cent for more than a year, only after the RBA hiked rates 13 times over a year and a half to stamp out soaring price pressures.
The central bank has now lowered the rate to 4.1 per cent.
In a statement on Tuesday, Treasure Jim Chalmers claimed the rate cut was a victory for the Labor Party, claiming the reduction is the ""soft landing we have been planning for"".
“Today’s result is a demonstration of the substantial and sustained progress we’ve made on inflation together,” Mr Chalmers said.
“When we came to office, interest rates were going up, now they are going down. For a household with a mortgage of $500,000, this rate cut will save them $80 a month, or $960 per year.
“Under Labor, inflation is down, wages are up, unemployment is low and now interest rates have started to come down too.""
The Treasurer claimed Australians would be thousands of dollars worst off if the LNP's economic policies were adopted, and households would suffer further strain if Liberal leader Peter Dutton secured a win in the upcoming federal election.
However, founder of Wizard Home Loans, Australia's second largest non-bank mortgage lender, Mark Bouris, told Sky News Mr Chalmers “hasn't had anything to do with the cut.”
“The cut has come about as a result of Australians restraining their spending habits as a result of higher interest rates,” Mr Bouris said to host Andrew Bolt.
“I don't see which government, whether a state or federal government, has done anything to control inflation in this country.
“The inflation has been controlled in this country by virtue of consumers changing their spending behaviour.""
The rate cut will save the average Aussie homeowner about $1,200 over the coming 12 months, with all four major banks passing the cuts to their customers
“Australians have suffered for a long time with really high cost of living, and on top of that three million Australians have suffered for a long time with a really high mortgage rate - 12 rate rises coming off the back of a very low rate,"" Mr Bouris said.
“They probably thought, well, let's give them the benefit of the doubt and see what response we're gonna get from the consumers.”
The finance guru suggested that both state and federal governments had ""misdirected"" their efforts by adopting a people-pleasing approach, resulting in decreased productivity, rising inflation, and high electricity prices.
“All governments… have certainly been a bit misdirected in where they're concentrating their efforts,” he said.
“I see the way it's going is that governments have actually tried to be popular and satisfy everybody's requests.
“That is, from every walk of life, particularly in relation to the Labor Party, because the Labor Party's made up of lots of different groups, and you can't, at the end of the day, satisfy everybody's requirements. It's impossible.”",SKY News,finance
Star Entertainment Group offered a $650m lifeline from American firm Oaktree Capital Management amid dire financial woes,James Harrison,https://www.skynews.com.au/business/finance/star-entertainment-group-offered-a-650m-lifeline-from-american-firm-oaktree-capital-management-amid-dire-financial-woes/news-story/03598a29516ac0088e4c4cbecec66d58,"Star Entertainment Group is considering a $650m financial lifeline from a large American asset management firm as it desperately tries to stay afloat.
Sky News Australia last week reported the casino operator could be less than a week from collapse with little liquidity and financial strains dampening the company’s future.
It confirmed in January it had just $78m left in its coffers as of December 31 after churning through $107m over the previous three months.
Star has sold its Sydney casino’s event space for $60m and knocked back several offers from foreign investors looking to purchase its 50 per cent stake in the Brisbane Queen’s Wharf precinct, but negotiations are ongoing.
After a report in the Australian Financial Review’s Street Talk column on Sunday revealed Oaktree Capital Management was trying was trying to buy Star’s lenders, it has since confirmed it received a nine-figure offer.
Star on Monday said the $650m proposal would come in two debt facilities over the space of five years.
The proposal is subject to an array of conditions including “a comprehensive security package” which would need the green light from the NSW and Queensland governments and regulators.
It would also need the approval of the existing lenders via a refinancing agreement or a settlement and the “completion of due diligence in relation to specified matters”.
“The Board of The Star will consider the proposal,” Star told shareholders.
However, it noted there was “no certainty” that the proposal would be undertaken or implemented.
“If The Star proceeds with the proposal, the company will require additional funding for the period prior to the proposal being implemented,” the company said.
It added the company was looking into possible liquidity options that would help it prevent entering administration.
“In the absence of one or more of those arrangements, there remains material uncertainty as to the Group's ability to continue as a going concern,” it said.
Star raised $100m in early December in the first half of a two-tranche loan package it secured in September that gives the company upwards of $200m.
But to access the second half of the package, Star has tough conditions to meet, particularly with raising $150m of subordinated debt - a low priority loan that is not necessarily secured by a company's assets or other forms of collateral.
The offer from Oaktree is not conditional on the company raising subordinated debt “nor any waiver or deferral of tax payable to State Governments”.
Sky News’ Business Editor Ross Greenwood last week revealed Star was on the brink of collapse.
“Sources close to the financially troubled Star Entertainment have revealed to us that the company could enter administration within a week as its cash reserves again run dry,” Greenwood said on Business Now.
Star was publicly listed on the ASX in 2011 about $3.40 before rising to over $5.20 at the start of 2018.
As of Monday, the share price is just 12 cents.",SKY News,finance
Finance Sector Union demands answers after Commonwealth Bank of Australia cuts more than 160 roles in technology division,James Harrison,https://www.skynews.com.au/business/finance/finance-sector-union-demands-answers-after-commonwealth-bank-of-australia-cuts-more-than-160-roles-in-technology-division/news-story/73d3b823cca3c973bc826a779b3c4dea,"A major union has demanded answers from Commonwealth Bank of Australia after it was revealed 164 workers will be sacked from the bank’s technology division.
CommBank, the nation’s biggest bank and the largest company listed on the ASX in terms of market capitalisation, will sack more than 150 Sydney-based workers, while the remaining roles came out of Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, Hobart and Tweed Heads.
The move sparked outcry from the almost 22,000-strong Finance Sector Union which demanded the bank explain this decision just weeks after it posted a whopping $5.13b half year profit.
It also cited previous comments from CommBank’s Chair who told shareholders the bank needed to ensure it had “the most capable engineering and digital talent”.
“On the one hand, the CBA tells its shareholders that it is facing a skills shortage in Australia and it has a commitment to digital talent. And on the other hand, it cuts a further 164 jobs from its Technology division,” FSU National Assistant Secretary Jason Hall said.
“The CBA owes its workers an explanation for why its actions don’t match its words.""
In justifying the move, CommBank reportedly said it was “enhancing capability” and to “deliver digital customer experiences faster, we will require enhanced skill-sets to support new ways of working”.
Mr Hall called this explanation “almost meaningless” and demanded “honesty and clarity at the very least” for the workers who lost their jobs.
“We have written to the CBA seeking clearer answers,” he said.
A CommBank spokesperson said the company “regularly reviews” its operations and this meant “some roles and work can change”.
“Our focus is on providing our growing team with the right skills for the evolving work,” the spokesperson said.
“Our priority is always to redeploy or reskill for a new role or opportunity wherever possible.
“We are working closely with every individual to support them with respect and care.”
They noted CommBank had invested “more than two billion dollars” into its technology operations.
“We employ more than 12,000 people in Technology and in 2024 we hired 1,200 technologists in engineering, cyber, data scientists, architects and tech data analysts,” the spokesperson said.
CommBank currently has more than 400 technology roles open in Australia.
The job cuts come as CommBank will deliver billions in dividends as bank pays its shareholders from its windfall profit in the first half of the 2025 financial year.
The company announced an interim dividend of $2.25 per share, which comes in at about 73 per cent of the bank’s profit, or $3.7b.
This is a five per cent increase on the dividend paid in the first half of the 2024 financial year and will be paid on March 28.",SKY News,finance
"Star Entertainment Group signs deal to sell stake in Brisbane's Queen's Wharf to raise cash avoid, avoid entering administration",James Harrison,https://www.skynews.com.au/business/finance/star-entertainment-group-unable-to-reach-deal-to-sell-stake-in-brisbanes-queens-wharf-precinct-as-administration-looms/news-story/7f6334d48d460d7e3acb5ebe57d4dc43,"Star Entertainment Group has reportedly signed a deal to sell its 50 per cent stake in the Queen’s Wharf precinct to Hong Kong investors to secure the cash-strapped company $53 million.
Reports first emerged on Thursday that Star was close to securing a deal where it would sell off its stake in the Brisbane property to Far East Consortium and Chow Tai Fook – which each own 25 per cent stakes in the precinct.
It comes about a month after the casino operator confirmed it had knocked back several offers from the Hong Kong investors as they could not come to an agreement on key details.
The Australian Financial Review reported just after 2pm on Friday the Star had finally signed a deal to sell its stake.
The deal will be subject to approval from the Queensland Government and Star is expected to confirm this with shareholders later on Friday.
Earlier in the day, Star told shareholders it had been in discussion with the Hong Kong-based companies, which it refers to as “Joint Venture Partners”, but stressed that a deal was yet to happen.
“The Star has been unable to reach an agreement with its Joint Venture Partners to date,” Star said.
This deal comes as the embattled casino operator has desperately looked for more cash.
The company was forced into a trading halt earlier this week after failing to publish its half-year financial results by the deadline of last Friday.
Star confirmed it was ""unlikely"" to lodge its financial results unless it could secure a lifeline that would ""refinance all of the group's existing corporate debt"" and provide ""additional liquidity"".
It was also reported Star’ chief executive Steve McCann is trying to secure the $60m from the sale of its events centre at its Sydney premises, which remains in escrow.
This was not directly addressed in Star’s note to shareholders on Friday, however, it did reference “recent media speculation” on Thursday “relating to various matters”.
Star, in January, revealed the sale of the complex – which it had previously described as a $100m venue – to Foundation Theatres.
The company may be able to post its results after securing the cash from this sale and the Queen's Wharf deal.
Star’s attempts to secure more cash comes at it owes about $430m to an array of lenders and is facing hefty fines from AUSTRAC.
Sky News' Business Reporter Ed Boyd on Thursday afternoon said the company was paying a hefty interest rate to banks of ""around 16 per cent"".
He also noted the company's future in administration could cost around $300m but stressed there is an option for the company to secure more cash.
""Pub baron Bruce Mathieson's company, they've placed a $550m bid just for the Gold Coast Jupiter's Casino - that's been knocked back but that bid is still on the table,"" Boyd said.
Another lifeline could come from Queensland coal miner Chris Wallin who has reportedly offered the casino operator a $200m bridging loan to give the company more time for a potential turnaround.
The company is also considering a $650m financial lifeline from American asset management firm Oaktree Capital Management which could help it stay afloat.
However, this deal could be in doubt, according to Sky News’ Ross Greenwood, as Oaktree wants the ""rights over the property"" where the Star Casino in Sydney sits, which is owned by the NSW government.
“My understanding of it is that there is no way known that the New South Wales government will give that up easily,"" Greenwood said.
“In fact, the NSW government, in my understanding, would allow the Star to go into insolvency and then deal with the administrators.”
The Australian Securities Exchange on Monday alerted shareholders that Star, alongside seven other publicly listed companies, was suspended from trading for failing to publish their results.",SKY News,finance

NSW Opposition Leader Mark Speakman slammed the government over its handling of securing a deal with Victoria, which was continuing to cement itself as the sporting capital of Australia.
Mr Speakman said it was a “spectacular failure” by the Minns government, claiming it could have been a golden opportunity to bring millions of dollars of revenue, while utilising the vast number of rectangular stadiums in NSW.
“We have better facilities in NSW for a rectangular game and we've lost this opportunity … to put Sydney on a world map,” he said on SEN 1170 Afternoons.
“You'd have hundreds of millions of viewers possibly watching this game.
“What seems to have happened here is the government hasn't put any money at all on the table.""
On Thursday, the Victorian government secured in-season NFL matches for a three-year deal likely to exceed $40m, according to The Daily Telegraph.
Speculation is now growing the NBA could also be heading to Melbourne.
Victoria is set to host two exhibition games in October 2025, according to ESPN sources.
NSW Tourism Association CEO Natalie Godward said the decision not to chase the NFL was an ""epic failure"".
“This is an epic failure for the NSW Government and Destination NSW,” she said.
“It’s inexplicable that NSW could … (lose) one of the most sought-after pieces of sporting and tourism content in the world.""
Ms Godward said the American Football fixtures would have delivered massive economic benefits and global exposure for NSW.
She claimed the state has failed to pounce on a “huge, missed opportunity” while Victoria continue to secure world-class events.
Melbourne will boost their sporting portfolio with the first game of NFL set to launch at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in 2026 with the Los Angeles Rams set to take on the Philadelphia Eagles.
Aussie fans might be in favour for the Eagles, if they take on the Rams, as they boast Sydney-born superstar and former rugby league player Jordan Mailata.
As the NFL overlooked NSW, Premier Minns said the matches did not meet the state budget as funding for schools, hospitals and wages were a bigger concern.
“We looked at it. It’s too expensive,” he said.
“They were after a King’s ransom … we’ve got schools, hospitals and wages we have got to cover.
“If we can get events into NSW that drive economic growth, we are up for it, but not under any circumstances.”
Tourism and Transport Forum CEO Margy Osmond said every state had to “make choices as to where they get the biggest bang for their buck”.
“The NFL will be terrific for Victoria,” she said.
Sydney sporting fans can look forward to mixed martial arts on Sunday with UFC 312 to be showcased at Sydney’s Qudos Bank Arena.
Premier Minns and Destinations NSW struck a $16 million deal in 2023 for Sydney to host three major UFC fight cards over the next four years.
“We love the UFC for years and years, it’s been fantastic for crowds and great for the economy,” Mr Minns said on Straight Talk with Mark Bouris.

The Philadelphia Eagles hammered the back-to-back Super Bowl champions Kansas City 40-22 on Sunday, US time, preventing the Chiefs from completing a three-peat.
Starring for the Eagles was 27-year-old offensive tackle Jordan Mailata, an Australian who previously tried to make it as a rugby league player, who became the first Australian to play in and win a Super Bowl.
The boy from Bankstown spent time in the juniors system with both the Canterbury Bulldogs and the Rabbitohs, where he became part of the under-20s squad.
Mailata never went on to make the grade with the Rabbitohs, who deemed him to be too big and instead offered him a $5,000 contract to play reserve grade.
On Monday though, after the Eagles prevailed in the NFL showpiece, the Rabbitohs were quick to claim Mailata as a former representative of the club.
""First Aussie and first Rabbitoh to WIN a Super Bowl!!"" the post read.
Many were quick to remind Souths that they were the club to let the eventual NFL star go.
""How do you celebrate him when you cut him?,"" one said.
""Oh please he played 12 games in U20s then you got rid of him but now you want to claim him?,"" another commented.
""Embarrassing post. You are just coat tail riders,"" a third said.

Mailata never held any bad blood over the Rabbitohs' decision to cut him loose. A highlights package of him eventually worked its way to NFL scouts, before he stunningly made the Eagles squad for 2018, having never played American football before.
Speaking to the Sydney Morning Herald before his debut, he acknowledged the Rabbitohs ""gave me a chance"" and that without the club ""I wouldn't be here"".
Last year, Mailata signed a three-year contract extension with the Eagles, worth $105 million, and on Sunday he helped his side win the game's greatest prize.
""It's an undescribable feeling, I'm not really sure how to describe it. The best way I could probably do it is... it doesn't feel real,"" he told Good Morning America on Monday.",SKY News,sports

The South Sydney star, who is currently not playing due to injury, shared a photo to a Facebook fan page of himself on a quadbike with his 15-month-old son.
The photo received negative comments, leading to Mitchell's mother to speak out.
His mother Patricia Goolagong shared her ""disgust"", hitting back at online trolls continuing to make her son's life a ""constant misery"".
""I’m just sick and tired of these cowards and the way they attack my son and make his life a constant misery,"" Goolagong told Nine's Wide World of Sports.
""They really make his life hard and then to bring his little boy into it takes it to a whole new level. It just disgusts me and I wish I could confront these cowards face to face and see how brave they are then.""
Ms Goolagong confronted the keyboard warriors, with several people then removing their comments, according to Wide World of Sports.
However, some reportedly did not seem fazed over her efforts and continued to double down on their harsh comments.
The boss of the Rugby League Players Association (RLPA) Clint Newton said he is aware of the online abuse Mitchell faces along with other players.
""There is no place for it and we've worked with the NRL to create a space for players to come forward when they have been abused online - when it's worse than constructive criticism - and descends into outright abuse,"" Newton told the publication.
""There is no place for personal abuse of players - it's the lowest form of criticism. The NRLW players actually cop worse abuse than the men so it is very unfortunate. Latrell has been very brave in coming forward to hit out at online abuse.""
The Australian Rugby League Commission chairman Peter V'Landys said he would continue to protect all players from receiving abuse, adding players such as Mitchell are only human.
“Latrell Mitchell is one of the great players in the game and we want him here in our game,” he told Code Sports.
“We want him at his best. We can’t forget he is human at the end of the day.”
According to figures from an RLPA survey, it was revealed 67 per cent of players who suffer abuse online do not report the incidents to the NRL integrity unit.

Jacinta Allan grilled on how much taxpayers forked out to bring the NFL to Melbourne amid Victoria's soaring debt,Bryant Hevesi,https://www.skynews.com.au/australia-news/politics/jacinta-allan-grilled-on-how-much-taxpayers-forked-out-to-bring-the-nfl-to-melbourne-amid-victorias-soaring-debt/news-story/18d52e5ae9c603bae0502297d04717f3,"Jacinta Allan has been grilled on how much taxpayers forked out to secure NFL matches in Melbourne and whether Victoria can even afford to pay to have games of American football amid the state's soaring debt.
The Victorian Premier confirmed on Thursday the NFL was headed to the Melbourne Cricket Ground in an Australian first but fumbled the announcement in an interview with Nova Melbourne breakfast show Jase and Lauren.
Asked to confirm long-standing rumours of the NFL coming to Melbourne for a ""Nova exclusive"", the state Labor leader initially confused rugby league with American football.
""You are bang on. This is a touchdown for Melbourne and Victoria, the NRL,"" Ms Allan said before quickly correcting herself and saying ""the NFL"" multiple times.
The faux pas prompted show co-host Lauren Phillips to cheekily quip: ""Oh no, you're having a shocker this morning"".
The government managed to ""secure a multi-year deal for Melbourne tohost NFL regular season games"", with the first match to take place in 2026 with the Los Angeles Rams locked-in as the ""home"" team.
Their opponents are not yet known nor is the date of the match, although there is a possibility it will happen in September 2026 given that is the month the NFL season starts, which could potentially clash with AFL games.
During a press conference, Ms Allan cited ""commercial in confidence"" in declining to reveal what the government offered to bring the NFL to Melbourne.
""Consistent with other arrangements for big important events like this, these arrangements are commercial in confidence because this is about making sure that we retain our competitive edge in securing big and important events like this one,"" she said.
Ms Allan also brushed aside concerns about Victoria's financial capacity to secure the spectacle, with the state's net debt on track to hit a whopping $187.3 billion in 2027-28.
""This is absolutely going to support our strong economy here in Victoria. Major events like this one support jobs and that's why we're backing them,"" she said.
""Everyone is a winner from this because it's about bringing visitors to Melbourne. It's about showcasing Melbourne to the world. And don't underestimate how many people go, I'm going to go and visit Melbourne.
""The visitor economy – sporting events, major events, the cultural events – that contributes billions and billions and billions to our economy every single year.""
Financial concerns were the major factor in Victoria pulling out of hosting the 2026 Commonwealth Games planned for Geelong, Bendigo, Shepparton, Ballarat and Gippsland.
In July 2023, then premier Daniel Andrews pulled the pin on the games claiming costs had blown out to between $6 and $7 billion, well above the $2.6 billion which had been allocated in the budget, and that was ""well and truly too much for a 12 day sporting event"".
Ms Allan - who had served as Commonwealth Games delivery minister - said on Thursday her government was determined to fight to bring major events to Victoria.

NRL exploring Grand Final idea to increase American interest as game prepares to take on Vegas for second year in a row,Patrick Staveley,https://www.skynews.com.au/australia-news/sport/nrl-exploring-grand-final-idea-to-increase-american-interest-as-game-prepares-to-take-on-vegas-for-second-year-in-a-row/news-story/1f7593441f2b4d7131977485bdacdacf,"The NRL is exploring another ambitious option to sell rugby league to Americans, on the eve of a blockbuster day for the game in Las Vegas.
Fans have turned out in full force in Sin City over the past week during an NRL takeover ahead of a massive day at Allegiant Stadium on Saturday, US time (Sunday AEDT).
Four matches will take place at Allegiant Stadium, the same ground that hosted the NFL Super Bowl just last month, including the NRL curtain-raisers - Canberra Raiders vs New Zealand Warriors and Penrith Panthers vs Cronulla Sharks.
While the week has looked like another burgeoning success, the NRL is always alert to new ideas that could continue to take the game forward and sell it outside of Australia.
Warriors chief executive Cameron George suggested the idea of having the NRL Grand Final this year broadcast from the highly popular Sphere in Vegas.
""There’s an opportunity to have an office and presence here to continually work on the ground corporately, commercially, building a fan base and promoting the game,"" he said.
“I don’t know what the cost would be, but something like showing our grand final live into the sphere could be an amazing experience for the game.
“It would build our fan base over here and they could enjoy it as a wonderful introduction to some of the biggest games on the calendar.”
NRL chief executive Andrew Abdo said the idea was ""interesting"" and worth exploring.
“Any way in which we can promote the game in the US into new markets will be looked at,” he said.
The Sphere was opened in September 2023, and has a capacity of 17,600 seated. The $2.3 billion USD venue has quickly become one of the top attractions in the city.
The NRL is hoping for upwards of 50,000 fans to walk through the gates of Allegiant Stadium on Saturday.
Last year the overall number fell just short of 40,000.
All matches will be broadcast on Kayo and Foxtel.
Schedule (AEDT time):
8:30am: Wigan Warriors vs Warrington Wolves (Super League)

Usman Khawaja claps back at Queensland cricket boss' 'categorically untrue' remarks as his wife fumes over the feud's fallout,Adriana Mageros,https://www.skynews.com.au/australia-news/sport/usman-khawaja-claps-back-at-categorically-untrue-comments-from-queensland-cricket-as-his-wife-fumes-over-the-feuds-fallout/news-story/9c9bd9332e0312841549ce611875370a,"Usman Khawaja has clapped back at ""inflammatory "" comments from Queensland Cricket coach Joe Dawes, as the 38-year-old declared his wife is ""more angry than anyone"" about the feud.
A war of words has erupted between Khawaja and Dawes in recent days following the former's absence in the Sheffield Shield match against South Australia in Adelaide last week.
Khawaja has repeatedly said he skipped the match due to hamstring concerns, but the Queensland Cricket coach has claimed medical staff were not aware of any sort of injury.
Rather than playing in the fixture, the 38-year-old batsman flew interstate to watch the Formula 1 Grand Prix in Melbourne.
Speaking at a media conference on Friday, Khawaja hit back at Dawes as he criticised Queensland Cricket's ""categorically untrue"" comments about his match absence.
""For me, the most disappointing thing was, I try to keep this as in house as possible behind the scenes ­- it’s obviously not anymore,"" Khawaja said.
""Joe Dawes came out the other day and said a few inflammatory things, which was really disappointing to me as a player, and after that, I just felt like I had to speak up and say something, and at least give my side a story.""
Khawaja' said Dawes' claim that medical staff had ""no idea"" about his hamstring concerns was ""100 per cent wrong"".
""I’ve talked to both our (Queensland) physios. I’ve talked to the Australian physio. I was talking to the Australian physio the whole time,"" Khawaja said.
""It’s on AMS - our Athlete Management System. My hammy (injury) is reported. Everything is there. Everyone knew about it.
""That was probably one of the most shocking things I heard said. It was really disappointing because it’s categorically untrue, so I just wanted to clear that up.... the physios 100 per cent knew about my hammy injury.""
Khawaja said his wife is furious over what has unfolded, and spoke about his decision to leave his family behind to play against Tasmania while Cyclone Alfred hit his home city Brisbane.
""I played through the Tassie game with an injury, I knew it was a do-or-die game, but more... I left my family before Cyclone Alfred was going to hit,"" Khawaja said.
“I sat down with my wife, and this is hand-on-heart the true story, and I was like, ‘I should stay, my family is in Sydney, your family is up the coast, I don’t want you to be home alone, like what are you going to do if something happens?
""And she dead looked me in the face and said, ‘Uzzie, Queensland Cricket has given you so much, you owe it to them to play, we’ve got great neighbours, they’ll look after me if anything happens… don't worry, I'll be fine’.
""And to be honest my wife is probably more angry than anyone else, because she’s the one who actually told me to get on the plane and go play Tassie.
""So for Joe Dawes to come out and say that I don't care, that I don't make sacrifices, I left my family here during a cyclone.""
Khawaja also elaborated on some of his movement concerns, including a tear he suffered to his rotator cuff and a ""calf niggle"" which came up during the first Test in Sri Lanka.
""I’m 38 years old... I can’t burn the candle at both ends. I do have to look after myself in some respect, and Queensland cricket do know that,"" he said.
His comments come after Dawes on Wednesday questioned Khawaja's hamstring claim, declaring there was ""no reason"" why the cricketer could not play in the draw with South Australia.
""That is my understanding from Cricket Australia staff as well – no hamstring issues as far as we are concerned,"" Dawes said at a media conference.
""I go off our medical staff and there is no reason why he could not have played the last game.
""It’s just disappointing he didn’t play a game for Queensland when he had an opportunity to.
""I have got a bunch of blokes here that all want to play. I think we are disappointed he did not play the game against South Australia.""",SKY News,sports
LA Rams to play first-ever regular season NFL game at MCG as the American game heads to Melbourne in 2026,Amy Roulston,https://www.skynews.com.au/australia-news/sport/la-rams-to-play-firstever-regular-season-nfl-game-at-mcg-as-the-american-game-heads-to-melbourne-in-2026/news-story/9e9308d9e8f15b978bd54ad77b20ed2e,"The NFL's first-ever regular season game in Australia will be played at the iconic Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) in 2026.
The Los Angeles Rams will reportedly face off against the Philadelphia Eagles, the only other team to hold marketing rights in Australia as part of the league's Global Markets Program.
While the schedule is still being confirmed, there is a possibility the first match could clash with first week of AFL finals in September.
The MCG selection is the latest move in the league's bid to expand the sport internationally.
NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said touching down in Melbourne was a ""significant next step"" in expanding the lead international footprint.
""Expanding to Melbourne, Australia, a beautiful city with a rich sports history, underlines our ambitions to become a global sport and accelerate international growth,"" Mr Goodell said.
Next year's game, a part of a multi-year deal, will be the first time the NFL has played a regular-season game in the Asia-Pacific region.
Visit Victoria board member Eddie McGuire said there was a competitive bidding war to secure the fixture.
However, Victorian Premier Jacinta Allan said the deal was commercial in confidence, meaning the cost of securing the partnership will be kept quiet.
But with Australia's growing 6.6 million NFL supporters and Delta Air Lines new direct flights from LA to Melbourne, the single venue-oriented set-up all but guarantee's revenue for the state.
""This is about maintaining our competitive edge when it comes to securing big and important events like this one,"" Ms Allan said on Thursday.
""This is absolutely going to support our strong economy here in Victoria, major events like this one support jobs and that is why we're backing them.
""Everyone is a winner from this.""
Los Angeles Rams Owner/Chairman E. Stanley Kroenke said choosing Australia could serve as a gateway to other countries in the Asia-pacific region.
""When we first identified Australia as one of our global markets, it was not only because of our passionate fans who reside there, but also because of the important role Los Angeles plays in serving as a gateway to Australia and many countries across the Pacific,"" he said.
""Today is an exciting day for Rams fans across the world, especially in Australia, where our players and organization have received an enthusiastic reception over the past few years when we have been in market.""",SKY News,sports
Triple M's Marty Sheargold cops backlash over 'pathetic' Matildas comments on-air,Preston Potts,https://www.skynews.com.au/australia-news/sport/triple-ms-marty-sheargold-cops-backlash-over-pathetic-matildas-comments-onair/news-story/b4b6e063d6e59f255552026dddd28d78,"Radio host Marty Sheargold has received backlash online after making controversial remarks about the Matildas football team and women's sport.
During a segment on Triple M comments were made on-air from Sheargold about The Matildas who are currently playing in the United States in the annual SheBelieves Cup along with Japan, Colombia and the host nation.
The program started discussing the results from the women's national football team, that's when the host had his say.
The results have not gone the way of the Tillies of late with the squad losing 4-0 to Japan on Friday (AEDT) and then losing a tight one to the US 2-1 on Monday.
Sheargold shared his two-cents on the recent performances.
“There’s something wrong with the Matildas,” he said.
“They had that wonderful tournament out here where we all fell in love with them, even though they didn’t make the quarters.
*I had to sensor this myself with a beep because the audio was so horrendous
“You know what they remind me of? Year 10 girls.
“All the infighting and all the friendship issues, ‘the coach hates me and I hate bloody training and Michelle’s being a b**ch’.
“Now I’m sorry to undermine the whole sport, but that’s what I think of it so you can stick it up your arse.”
Sheargold finished off his tirade claiming he would rather ""hammer a nail through the head of my p*nis than watch that"", before asking his colleague Will Ralston if his program has ""got any men's sport"".
His comments sparked a reaction on a TikTok video from Olympic hockey player Rosie Malone, showing the audio captioned ""I honestly don't know what is wrong with the world"".
""I heard this on the radio yesterday in prime time (5.30pm) on the way to training and all I could think about was the young girls sitting in the car with their parents, maybe on the way to or from their own training sessions hearing this,"" the Hockeyroo player said.
""I'm sure many of them would have been hurt and confused...I was in disbelief.
""This is apparently acceptable on mainstream afternoon radio??? HOW??""
The video has now reached over 250,000 views and triggered a warranted reaction in the comment section with many saying they have sent a complaint to the station.
""Complaint sent to Triple M, sick of hearing his horrific takes across multiple platforms,"" one said.
""Is this a f**king joke?!? I feel like I’m living in a simulation. That cannot be a real recording,"" another added.
""That's actually pathetic,"" a third said.
A handful of comments sided with Sheargold on the matter.
""I laughed. I love their show, it's just humour and jokes…"" One mother said.
""HAHAHA thank you I love this, he's actually hilarious x oh no, someone prefers men's sports to womens? Immediately sexist? What about those who only watch women's sport?"" Another added.
Southern Cross Austereo and Sheargold have since responded to the incident.
“Marty Sheargold’s comments regarding the Matildas - made during Triple M Drive on Monday, 24 February - do not align with Triple M's views and values, and Triple M remains steadfast in its strong support of all women's and men's sports. We are sorry for any offence caused,"" an SCA spokesperson said.
“Any comedy, including mine, can miss the mark sometimes, and I can see why people may have taken offence to my comments regarding the Matildas. I sincerely apologise,"" Sheargold said.
The radio personality only returned to the airwaves late last year after a high-profile end to his previous morning show on Triple M in late 2023.
The 53-year-old announced at the time he was taking an extended break to spend more time with family and “prioritise self-care (and) maintaining a better work/life balance”.
After a period of sobriety, Sheargold hit the headlines following a drunken incident at the 2023 AFL grand final, leading to his decision to step away from the spotlight.",SKY News,sports
NRL Canberra Raiders players Hudson Young and Morgan Smithies apologise for drunken hotel scuffle in Las Vegas,Preston Potts,https://www.skynews.com.au/australia-news/sport/nrl-canberra-raiders-players-hudson-young-and-morgan-smithies-apologise-for-drunken-hotel-scuffle-in-las-vegas/news-story/17842e038dae6a434700273f9dd7e860,"Canberra Raiders duo Hudson Young and Morgan Smithies have apologised for their drunken hotel scuffle in Las Vegas.
Young and Smithies fronted the media on Tuesday morning (AEDT) after the two exchanged blows in an elevator in the NRL hub at Hiltons Resorts World on Thursday night (local time), just hours after touching down in the United States.
The two butted heads over a disagreement when one of the players did not have a hotel room to go back to after a check-in malfunction at reception. He wanted to share a room with his teammate, who did not agree.
The teammates were in possession of an inflatable baseball bat, in which hotel security thought it was a real bat.
Reports from The Sydney Morning Herald state the two players were briefly evicted from the hotel by security, before being allowed to return to their rooms.
Young apologised for his actions and said it ""wasn't good enough"".
""The NRL invests so much time and effort into this game. It's such a great space to be a part of here in Vegas and a great spectacle. Things got a bit out of hand on Thursday night. I'm embarrassed for myself, our teammates and the NRL,"" Young said.
""We are best mates. He was at mine for Christmas and our partners are travelling America at the moment so there's no issues there.
""I feel awful, especially for my family as well. It's a massive thing for them coming over here and they have to deal with this as well.""
Englishman Smithies was seen with a noticeable black eye on Tuesday morning but said it occurred at training rather than the hotel scuffle.
Prior to the two talking to media, Raiders coach Ricky Stuart said he had spoken to Hudson and Smithies who were ""very embarrassed"".
""I have spoken to the players who are very embarrassed,"" Stuart said.
""The behaviour was unacceptable. The club will deal with this strongly.""
The Canberra club reported the incident to the NRL Integrity Unit, but there has been no sanctions handed down as of Tuesday morning.
The two are expected to receive a monetary fine over the scuffle before the NRL kicks off in Sin City.
Season two of the Las Vegas experiment kicks off on March 2, Sunday 11am (AEDT), when the Raiders face the New Zealand Warriors in the opening match at Allegiant Stadium.

Port Adelaide head coach Ken Hinkley to step down after the 2025 season to make way for senior assistant Josh Carr,Preston Potts,https://www.skynews.com.au/australia-news/sport/port-adelaide-head-coach-ken-hinkley-to-step-down-after-the-2025-season-to-make-way-for-senior-assistant-josh-carr/news-story/e75165c096653c0253222cc05ede33e4,"Port Adelaide’s longest serving coach Ken Hinkley will hand over the reigns for season 2026 with senior assistant Josh Carr to lead the club into a new footballing era.
Carr will look to start his head coaching role on an initial three-year contract commencing after 2025.
Having coached Port Adelaide since 2013, Hinkley, who will make way for a new succession plan at the club, said he felt the timing was right for himself to stand down.
“I’ve enjoyed open dialogue with the club for some time now in regard to this being my final season in charge,” he said in a club statement.
“I, along with our leaders at the club, always have an eye for the future and as I’ve been saying for the last year, Josh Carr is absolutely the best person to take over as senior coach at the right time.”
Hinkley said the desire still burns within to lead the South Australian team, saying he is feeling “fresh and recharged” to chase a flag for season 2025.
He claims having Carr under his wing for 12 months will not only grow him as a coach, but gain much needed experience for when he is ready to coach in his “own right”.
Hinkley is the longest serving Port Adelaide coach and has so far coached 275 games with a 60 per cent win record.
Port have only taken home one AFL premiership back in 2004 and the club has not been in a grand final since losing to Geelong in 2007.
Ken Hinkley has informed the club he will step aside at seasonâ€™s end and hand over to Josh Carr as senior coach in 2026.ðŸ“ https://t.co/2Ej5SMdUSs pic.twitter.com/ii6Y2V97ca
The hunger for a second flag still remains top priority for the club following years of failed attempts.
The furthest Hinkley got Port in the finals was reaching the preliminary finals in 2024, 2021, 2020, and 2014.
Carr said he isn’t putting much thought into 2026 as he remains focused on bringing success for Port this year as assistant coach.
“Whilst it’s an honour to have been appointed Port Adelaide’s next senior coach, my focus right now is to support Ken, the other coaches and players as best I can as we strive for success this season,” he said.
“Ken is the senior coach. I will continue as coach of our midfield group and take every opportunity to develop and grow as a coach across this season.”
Port Adelaide chairman David Koch said Hinkley had approached the club in the off-season to confirm he had one year left in him before moving on.
“Our club is in a very fortunate position to have Ken continue to lead and coach our group this season, and to have Josh Carr, one of the most sought-after assistant coaches in the AFL, well prepared to take over in 2026,” Mr Koch said.
Mr Koch said the club had always maintained an eye for the future and wanted to produce coaches within house.
“As an organisation, we support the growth and development of our people to ensure our organisation continues to grow and prosper. Whether it be our chief executive, our head of high performance, or our next senior coach,” he said.
“The discussion with Josh at the end of 2023 was that we believed he had the right attributes to be an AFL senior coach in the future and hopefully the senior coach of Port Adelaide, and we wanted to continue to support that path for him.
“Across the last 18 months we’ve seen Josh continue to grow and develop and believe he is perfectly positioned to lead our club in his own right in 2026.”",SKY News,sports

McAvaney said he “can’t wait” to return and be alongside Seven’s “outstanding football team” for a hosting role.
""Some of my fondest memories have been in Seven's AFL commentary box, and I can't wait to witness more unforgettable moments during the 2025 season.

The veteran broadcaster retired from calling AFL in 2021 but was notably present during the 2024 AFL Finals Series as he was in the commentary box calling both preliminary finals and the Sydney Swans vs Brisbane Lions Grand Final.
Brian Taylor was Seven’s lead caller, but will now take a backwards step in a secondary role for season 2025.
Seven's director of sport, Chris Jones said he can’t wait for Australians to embrace McAvaney again on Seven.
“Bruce McAvaney is simply unrivalled and the greatest sports broadcaster of our generation. He is a beloved member of the Seven family, and we are thrilled that he is returning to our AFL coverage for Sunday nights and marquee matches this season,” he said.
“When Bruce returned to our AFL coverage during the Finals in 2024, we saw an outpouring of love from footy fans all over the country and we can't wait to see Australians embrace him again throughout the 2025 season.”
Having joined the Seven Network commentary team in 1990, McAvaney called more than 1000 AFL matches, over 30 AFL Grand Finals and hosted numerous amounts of Brownlow Medal ceremonies.

With ticket sales currently over 45,000, officials are hopeful of hitting the 50,000 mark in Vegas' Allegiant Stadium - a significant increase after it fell just shy of 40,000 in 2024.
Four games will be played instead of the two the year prior - English Super League powerhouses Wigan Warriors will play the Warrington Wolves, NRL sides Canberra Raiders, New Zealand Warriors, Penrith Panthers and the Cronulla Sharks will be in action, while women's international rugby league will be on show with the Jillaroos and England.
Mr Delany said the ""hype"" has been great for the event, as close to 20,000 Australians, about 10,000 spectators from England, and 8,000 fans from New Zealand flock to Sin City.
Tickets have also been sold in each of the 50 US States.
""The number of people is huge, the hype's great. My experience last year was just awesome. The people from all over the country here. And I mean Australia and America,"" the Foxtel Group chief executive told Sky News host Paul Murray in Vegas.
""You get the sense of this great celebration, of getting ready to go to a game. Last year NRL game attendances were up 25 per cent and I think it's a great kick off to the season.
""Forget what it's doing in America, for us at home I can't think of a better way to kick the season off.""
Fans keen to watch the event in Australia can tune in on Kayo or Foxtel from 8am AEDT to follow coverage and enjoy the ""extraordinary production"" of all four matches.
""It is quite extraordinary. This is something all Australians are starting to observe, better tune in on Kayo and Foxtel,"" Mr Delany said.
""You'll see extraordinary production of all four games on Sunday. All of our shows are over here, all our callers are over here. We are really in behind the NRL because we figure you've got to do it right.
""This is Vegas, it's show business right? It's uncontrolled explosions. That's the NRL.""
Australian Rugby League Commission chair Peter V'landys said he couldn't believe how much the showpiece has grown in 12 months.
During an event on Wednesday night local time, Mr V'landys was given the keys to the Las Vegas Strip and told the event had brought in $100 million worth of economic benefit to the city.
""We've become one of the biggest events in Vegas now,"" he said.
""All credit to the NRL staff, they work 12 months on this - it's not just a five minute exercise. To get all the eight teams over this, the first time having the women here. To get all the fields, gymnasiums and everything .
""It takes a lot of work, we've brought I don't know how many people over from the NRL to put this show together but they do it so well and so professionally. You can have the greatest ideas in the world but if you don't implement them right, they go to dust.""
Mr V'landys said the event was purely for the fans, and had become somewhat of a ""bucket list"" item for Australians.
He also said he hadn't stopped trying to convince President Donald Trump to come to the event, going as far as directly sending a message to him during a Fox News broadcast.
""Look every person that I know (who) knows Donald Trump, I've rung them, so I haven't stopped trying. I've gone to the most senior executives in Australia, to people that know him in America. I haven't given up. We've got as far as his office and we're just waiting,"" he said.
""He's an unpredictable person, who knows he may jump on a plane and come out. And if he does, he's going to meet more Australians in the one go than ever. We're the only country that has a trade surplus with (the US). He owes us in my view
""If he came here, the publicity that would generate on American television, you could not buy. If no one heard of rugby league, that'd have heard of it if he comes here Saturday.""",SKY News,sports

With the pre-match ceremony well underway, Australia's players waited for the music to being after the English side had finished their rendition of God Save the King.
However, in a serious error on the part of organisers, the Australian side were not greeted by Advance Australia Fair, but the opening to the Indian national anthem instead.
Things then got more embarrassing, as feedback interrupted India’s Jana-gana-mana anthem while cameras filmed an Australian flag flying high and another draped on the surface of the ground.
The technical difficulties lasted another few seconds, before the Australian anthem finally began to play.
Cricket fans around the world were left outraged by the blunder, considering India were not playing the game.
The incident led the Pakistan Cricket Board to lodge a compliant to the International Cricket Council, according to The Hindustan Times.

“The PCB has made it clear that the ICC needs to offer some explanation as their people are responsible for the (national anthem) playlist of teams in the Champions Trophy,” the publication was told by a source.
“Since India is not playing in Pakistan, it is hard to understand how their anthem was played by mistake from the playlist.”
The ICC is the global governing body of cricket and oversees the Champions Trophy, which is a 50-over tournament.
Pakistan is the host country for the tournament alongside the United Arab Emirates.
The UAE will host all of India’s matches due to long-standing enmity between Pakistan and India.
Gasps were head within the 30,000 crowd, with Pakistani locals bewildered by the anthem blunder.
Fans online gave their two-cents as to why it happened.

Some fans online also complained the anthem should have played out once it had started.
The tense rivalry between India and Pakistan has stretched back decades.

South Sydney Rabbitohs stars Cameron Murray and Latrell Mitchell struck down by injuries in training,Patrick Staveley,https://www.skynews.com.au/australia-news/sport/south-sydney-rabbitohs-stars-cameron-murray-and-latrell-mitchell-struck-down-by-injuries-in-training/news-story/856cafc6e4f6930e12bf92d512b63250,"A major crisis has hit the South Sydney Rabbitohs before the 2025 NRL season has even begun, following injuries to two of the club's most crucial players.
Cameron Murray and Latrell Mitchell were the players injured during the club's Wednesday training session, which has cast a dark cloud over the side's premiership hopes for 2025.
Murray suffered a suspected achilles rupture, a devastating injury diagnosis which leaves him facing the possibility of spending the entire season on the sidelines.
The 27-year-old has not yet had scans at the time of writing, but if the hands on testing is correct, he will have to undergo surgery and spend anywhere from five to eight months recovering.
Mitchell, 27, pulled up with a hamstring complaint during the same session, but in a positive sign was seen walking from the Heffron Park training field.
He will also go for scans to determine the full extent of the injury.
The fullback was named in Souths' line-up for their annual Charity Shield match this weekend against the Dragons, which is being held at Mudgee this year, though he has now been swiftly ruled out.
Murray had not been named to play as he was being held back for Round One along with star half Cody Walker.
Both stars will be major losses from the Rabbitohs' team as coach Wayne Bennett prepares to lead the club in his second stint at Redfern.
They are both key fixtures in the New South Wales and Australia set-ups and have 332 games of NRL experience total.
Fans have been salivating at the prospect of a fully fit Mitchell, who had been showing positive signs in training in an ominous sign for opposition teams.
Mitchell hasn't been able to catch a break from injuries, previously hurting his hamstring in 2020 and again in 2022.
He also suffered a Lisfranc foot injury in 2024, which kept him out of action for the last nine games of the season.
Murray and Mitchell's setbacks add to a worrying list of casualties before the regular season has even begun.

Professional Tennis Players Association launches legal action against tennis governing bodies alleging 'systemic abuse and corruption',Patrick Staveley,https://www.skynews.com.au/australia-news/sport/professional-tennis-players-association-launches-legal-action-against-tennis-governing-bodies-alleging-systemic-abuse-and-corruption/news-story/1e8e22e51bc9287ee85534c916520d4a,"The ATP has accused the Professional Tennis Players Association (PTPA) of causing division, after it launched legal action against the governing bodies of tennis.
The PTPA, which was founded in 2019 by Serbian tennis star Novak Djokovic and Canadian player Vasek Pospisil, filed a lawsuit against the ATP,  Women's Tennis Association, International Tennis Federation (ITF) and International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA).
A dozen current and former players have been listed as plaintiffs with the PTPA including Nick Kyrgios and Pospisil.
The PTPA's 162-page complaint accused the governing bodies of colluding with one another, according to ESPN, to reduce competition and prize money.
It has also demanded a jury trial.
""Following years of good-faith efforts to reform professional tennis, the Professional Tennis Players Association has taken decisive legal action,"" the statement read on Tuesday.
""Today, the PTPA, alongside over a dozen professional tennis players and on behalf of the entire player population, and renowned international law firm and historical player advocates Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP, initiated a series of legal actions in the US, UK and EU against the sport's governing bodies.
""The lawsuits expose systemic abuse, anti-competitive practices, and a blatant disregard for player welfare that have persisted for decades.""
Pospisil said in a statement the suit was about ""fairness, safety and basic human dignity"" rather than money.
Executive Director of the PTPA, Ahmad Nassar said ""tennis is broken"" and claimed the current system exploits the talent of players, ""suppresses"" their prize money and ""jeopardises their health and safety"".
The ATP responded, delivering a lengthy statement, defending its system and treatment of players as it recalled ""transformative changes"" that have been introduced in recent years including record-setting on-site prize money, and a major increase in player compensation.
""While ATP has remained focused on delivering reforms that benefit players at multiple levels, the PTPA has consistently chosen division and distraction through misinformation over progress,"" the statement said.
""Five years on from its inception in 2020, the PTPA has struggled to establish a meaningful role in tennis, making its decision to pursue legal action at this juncture unsurprising.
""We strongly reject the premise of the PTPA’s claims, believe the case to be entirely without merit, and will vigorously defend our position. ATP remains committed to working in the best interests of the game - towards continued growth, financial stability, and the best possible future for our players, tournaments, and fans.""",SKY News,sports
Police make shock discovery as drugs found inside Perth home where former West Coast Eagles star Adam Hunter found dead,Preston Potts,https://www.skynews.com.au/australia-news/sport/police-make-shock-discovery-as-drugs-found-inside-perth-home-where-former-west-coast-eagles-star-adam-hunter-found-dead/news-story/5a83aaa098535c7b9da4cf81c95d213e,"Police have made a shock discovery at the Perth home of West Coast Eagles premiership winner Adam Hunter, following his death on Wednesday.
Western Australia Police found methamphetamine and drug paraphernalia on Thursday at the home of the former AFL premiership winner.
Officers who attended the scene reported speaking to a number of witnesses in relation to the discovery.
Police and ambulance paramedics were called to Hunter's property in Bunbury, south of Perth, about 12.20am on Wednesday where he was found unresponsive.
The 43-year-old could not be revived and was pronounced dead at the scene.
A report will be prepared for the Coroner, with the death not being treated as suspicious.
Despite the discovery of drugs by WA Police, Hunter's cause of death is not yet known.
In a short statement, West Coast Eagles said it was ""devastated"" by the loss of Hunter.
""Our thoughts are with his family, teammates and friends,"" it read.

Hunter was part of the 2006 West Coast Eagles team which put an end to Sydney Swans' hopes of consecutive premiership wins, beating the harbour city team by a nail-biting point, 85-84.
He famously played a pivotal part in winning the flag by kicking the final goal with eight minutes until the siren.
Off field, the 43-year-old was a part of a troubled era for the East Coast side with teammates Daniel Kerr and Ben Cousins jailed following drug abuse.
Another one of his teammates, Chad Fletcher, almost died following a post-season trip to Las Vegas.
The utility played 151 games with the Western Australia club from 2000 to 2009.
He was eventually forced to retire from the sport due to persistent injuries.
Tributes from players and fans have started to pour in for Hunter following news of his death.
Former Swans player Jude Bolton described it as a ""sad couple of days across the entire footy industry"", adding it is ""bloody awful"" to have three AFL greats die in such a short space of time.
Hunter's passing follows the Tuesday deaths of ex-Brisbane Lions player Troy Selwood, who died at 40-years-old, and Essendon VFL coach Dale Tapping, who lost his cancer battle.
Selwood's twin brother Adam played with Hunter at West Coast.
Fans have taken to social media to send condolences to Hunter's loved ones.
""Forever an Eagles legend. Rest in peace,"" one person wrote on X.
""This has been a brutal couple of days but this might be the heaviest hit of all. So many memories, sharpest of all his crucial goal in the 2006 granny. Rest easy,"" another said.
""This is brutal news,"" a third AFL fan added.

India knocks Australia out of ICC Champions Trophy two months after Border-Gavaskar defeat,Patrick Staveley,https://www.skynews.com.au/australia-news/sport/india-knocks-australia-out-of-icc-champions-trophy-two-months-after-bordergavaskar-defeat/news-story/f547d80fd8fc1c7d5913f4d2bc260270,"Australia has been knocked out of the ICC Champions Trophy after a Virat Kohli masterclass helped steer India to victory.
Steve Smith (73 off 96) and Alex Carey (61 of 57) both put in key shifts to help Australia post a total of 264, as they lost all wickets with just three balls to spare.
The pair were the highlights of the Australian innings as only Travis Head (39 off 33) and Marnus Labuschagne (29 off 36) managed to also post a score of 20 or more.
Mohammed Shami, who missed India's tour of Australia in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, led the wicket-taking with 3/48, including the crucial dismissal of Smith.
Australia notched a couple of early breakthroughs in India's innings, sending Rohit Sharma (28) and Shubman Gill (8) on their way within the first eight overs to have them at 2/43.
It was the partnership of Shreyas Iyer (45) and Virat Kohli (84) which contributed to a huge chunk of India's run chase.
Kohli was dismissed by Adam Zampa, leaving India at 5/225, but KL Rahul held his nerve to deliver an unbeaten 42, including the match-winning six, as India only lost one more wicket to chase down Australia's total with 11 balls remaining.
The 36-year-old Kohli was praised by Smith who hailed the opponent as the greatest run chaser he has seen.
""He is arguably the best chaser the game has seen. He has done it numerous times against us. He controls the tempo of the game really well,"" he said after the match.
""They kept their run rate in check throughout. We were probably just one or two wickets away.
""We took it as deep as we could, but they chased really nicely.""
The Aussies made it out of the group stage despite having a depleted squad, missing all three main fast bowlers in Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood.
The side was helped though with the fact two of their three group matches were abandoned due to weather conditions.
India's victory was revenge for the 3-1 Test series defeat they suffered on Australian soil in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in the summer.
They will now face the winner of South Africa vs New Zealand in the final which will be held on Sunday.",SKY News,sports
'Disappointed': Former Qld premier Campbell Newman raises doubts over proposed Olympics stadium in Victoria Park,Gemma Crotty,https://www.skynews.com.au/australia-news/sport/disappointed-former-qld-premier-campbell-newman-raises-doubts-over-proposed-olympics-stadium-in-victoria-park/news-story/c2c198a269466646f1fefabe4e3819eb,"Former Queensland premier Campbell Newman has expressed his disappointment over a recommended 60,000-seat stadium in Victoria Park ahead of the 2032 Olympic Games.
An independent panel recommended the venue be built in the heritage-listed space in Brisbane's inner-city, 9News Queensland reported on Friday.
It is understood government officials will review the plan at a meeting of the state cabinet on Monday.
The panel has reportedly found there was not enough time for the 130-year-old Gabba to be rebuilt in time for the Games.
Speaking to Sky News host Steve Price on Friday, Mr Newman raised concerns over the proposed new stadium, particularly highlighting the matter of accessibility.
“I would be very disappointed if it was in Victoria Park,” the former premier said.
“For my money, I hope they do put the swimming… across the road from the Gabba ground, an excellent location because it's well served by public transport.
“A great upgrade of the Gabba, I think, is required anyway.”
Mr Newman acknowledged the Victoria Park venue could be “reasonably accessible” by public transport via the Cross River Rail, set to be completed by 2029.
However, he said: “The idea that you'll walk from the CBD from say the centre of town to the stadium I'm afraid is somewhat implausible.
""It's quite a hike up and down hills and you know we're talking about a 25 to 30 minute walk.""
Mr Newman said driving to the venue would probably not be an option due to the lack of space as it was “a very congested bottleneck area of the city as it is”.
He said the Gabba was the best location in South East Queensland for an Olympic stadium.
""It's not only got that crossover rail, it's a heavy rail transport, but it's also got a busway, a high capacity busway as well,"" he said.
“Building it at Victoria Park, depending on the location, it's either a bit of a hike or a very, very long hike because there's nothing around there.”
With the project also slated to cost $3.4 billion, Mr Newman questioned whether the proper planning had been done, noting it could be a “huge risk”.
Despite his objections to the slated location of the stadium, he urged the state government to make decisions promptly.
""I think we've got to a point, they've just got to get on with it for the sake of Australia's reputation and Queensland and Brisbane's reputation – we need decisions now and we need action,"" he said.
It comes as the state government is reportedly planning to build a state-of-the-art swimming arena across from the slated Victoria Park stadium, the Courier Mail reported on Saturday.
Highly placed sources have revealed the government is considering scrapping a plans for swimming events to be held in a drop-in pool at the proposed Brisbane Live Arena entertainment venue.
The findings of the 100-day review into Olympics venues and infrastructure are set to be announced by the Queensland government on Tuesday.",SKY News,sports
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese condemns Marty Sheargold's 'completely unacceptable' comments about the Matildas,Patrick Staveley,https://www.skynews.com.au/australia-news/sport/prime-minister-anthony-albanese-condemns-marty-sheargolds-completely-unacceptable-comments-about-the-matildas/news-story/a4438b9851921b31999df7c3b79f039d,"Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has issued a strong condemnation of Marty Sheargold's controversial on-air comments that led to the end of his relationship with Triple M.
Sheargold departed Triple M on Wednesday, in the wake of tremendous backlash after the host went on a tirade about the Matildas and women's sport.
In a rant, he joked the women's sports team reminded him of ""year 10 girls"".
“All the infighting and all the friendship issues, ‘the coach hates me and I hate bloody training and Michelle’s being a b**ch’,"" he said.
“Now I’m sorry to undermine the whole sport, but that’s what I think of it so you can stick it up your arse.”
Mr Albanese was asked for his thoughts on the matter during an appearance on Nova 100's Jase and Lauren on Thursday, where he didn't hold back on his criticism of Sheargold.
""They were just shocking comments that anyone could think it, let alone say it. Completely unacceptable. The Tillies are just legends. They excited and brought together the whole country,"" he said.
""The whole country was united in cheering for them. Women's and girl's sport has been a revolution in my lifetime, in football, as in soccer football, AFLW has a Governor General, Sam Austin was the first woman appointed as an AFL Commissioner, and she really drove the creation of AFLW, that's fantastic. Rugby League in Vegas, in a couple of days time, there'll be a women's game there, it's fantastic.""
The Prime Minister also touched on comments Sheargold made on Tuesday's show, where he claimed endometriosis - a condition close to a million Australian women suffer from, isn't real.
""You know, we need to respect each other, and disrespecting more than half the population is not on,"" he said.
""It's just not funny. It's offensive.""
Mr Albanese threw his support behind women's sport, reiterating the progress and success of Australian sportswomen in recent years.
""These are great athletes, like (the Matildas) performed so well to get to the semis in the World Cup, but even if they didn't, so what! They're doing their best, and they're great athletes, and they're better footballers than all the blokes who'd be critiquing them, frankly,"" he said.
""Remember the Olympics. Remember, as the gold medals came through, they had something in common. They were all women!... And certainly, the Matildas are... more successful historically than our men's team have been.
""Ellyse Perry, statistically, is probably the greatest cricketer - maybe Bradman but he didn't bowl - the greatest cricketer that Australia has produced.""
After Southern Cross Austereo Chief Content Officer Dave Cameron confirmed Wednesday night the broadcaster had parted ways with Sheargold, another shocking rant emerged which took place on the program on Tuesday.
“I’ve done me back. It’s no secret over the last couple of days – I can’t hide it anymore. I’ve got a heat pack behind my back, which is very comforting and thank you to (executive producer Whitney Plowman) for bringing her period heat pack here because, God, don’t ladies carry on?"" he said.
“Jesus Christ, there is no end of it. Honestly, endometriosis — and this is controversial …” Sheargold continued.
A fellow host was heard saying ""don't do it"" in a desperate bid to prevent the comments that were to come.
“No, I’m going to say it. It’s controversial,"" Sheargold said.
“(Endometriosis). It’s made up.""
Endometriosis is a condition where tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows outside of the uterus. The chronic condition can lead to pelvic pain, infertility and heavy periods.
Endometriosis advocate and Triple J host Bridget Hustwaite had called for the sacking of Sheargold hours before he left Triple M, saying his comments were medically inaccurate and dismissed the ""very real pain"" of women who suffered from it.",SKY News,sports
Sam Kerr admits in court she was hostile to a British cop but denies racial harassment after 'stupid and white' remark,Laurence Karacsony,https://www.skynews.com.au/australia-news/sport/sam-kerrs-partner-kristie-mewis-insists-in-court-matildas-star-was-speaking-her-truth-after-calling-uk-cop-stupid-and-white/news-story/735ede4062023bbbb0ca000328e04efe,"Sam Kerr’s partner and United States international Kristie Mewis told a London court on Thursday the Matildas star, who’s on trial for racial harassment, was “speaking her truth in how she was feeling”.
Earlier this week, a court heard the Chelsea FC superstar, who described herself as “white-Anglo-Indian”, branded two officers “f**king stupid and white” after she was taken to Twickenham Police Station by a taxi more than two years ago.
The pair appeared in the Kingston Crown Court this week over the incident which took place on January 30, 2023.
Kerr, among women’s football’s most decorated players, was subsequently charged with aggravated harassment to PC Stephen Lovell.
The Matildas captain did not deny calling PC Lovell “stupid and white” but has pleaded not guilty to the charge.
The incident took place after the pair had a drunken night out in London, resulting in Kerr vomiting in a taxi, a window being smashed and the divider being kicked in.
Prosecutor William Emlyn Jones KC, who had pressed Kerr for almost five hours on Wednesday, on Thursday focused on Kerr’s proceeding comments after “stupid and white”.
""What did his race have to do with anything?” Mr Emlyn Jones said.
Kerr said she had explained on Wednesday that she felt it was about PC Lovell “using his power and privilege over me”.
The prosecutor said the problem was based on PC Lovell’s “perception as a man” and not being able to put himself in the “shoes of a woman”.
“(It has) nothing to do with race, has it?” Mr Emlyn Jones said, to which the footballer admitted: “not particularly”.
""What you were saying to him, Ms Kerr, was you're stupid because you're white,"" the prosecutor said.
Kerr said “no”.
Mr Emlyn Jones told the court Kerr had chosen to demonstrate “hostility” to PC Lovell “because of his whiteness”.
The Matildas star said it was “not what I meant”.
Mr Emelyn Jones said: “That is what you did though, isn’t it?”
“Yes,” Kerr said.
The pair have claimed they felt they were being kidnapped by the taxi driver who had locked the doors and called the police after the damage was dealt to the vehicle, with Mewis describing the ordeal as ""obviously very scary"".
“I felt out of control and like someone else had control over me and that was obviously very scary,” Mewis said, describing the driving as “manic”.
“I didn’t know if it was a kidnapping or if we were going to crash.
“All of the horrible things you think about in your head, I didn’t know if that was going to happen.”
Mewis told of how she was relieved to be at the police station after the ordeal, by PC Lovell had been “immediately dismissive” about their story.
“We were two young women who had just been through something really terrifying and I don’t think they cared to listen,” she said.
“In my opinion, (the police officers) were trying to change the story and make it into something it wasn’t. It felt a little bit like gaslighting… the story (they) repeated back was different or they were manipulating it back onto us.”
Mewis said PC Lovell was “more snide” with Kerr, and when asked for her reaction to her partner’s “stupid and white” remark, she said she was “speaking her truth” and suggested the Matildas captain “subconsciously” felt she was being “treated differently”.
Kerr on Wednesday was asked by her lawyer, Grace Forbes, what she was “trying to express” by calling PC Lovell “f**king stupid and white”.
“I felt like they were treating me differently and not believing me and treating me as a person who had done something wrong because they were in the position of privilege and power and I believe they were treating me differently because of the colour of my skin,” Kerr told the jury.
Mewis said she had “seen it a lot”.
Ms Forbes asked Mewis what she meant by having “seen a lot”, to which Kerr’s partner said she had seen her being treated differently “multiple times” because of her skin colour.
“Sam is so loving, she’s so humble, she would help anybody… that’s one of the things I love about her so much,” Mewis said.
“She’s so inspiring, she inspires me every day. I wouldn’t want anyone else to be the mother of my child.”
Mr Emlyn Jones then cross-examined Mewis who admitted her partner’s behaviour that night “wasn’t great”.
Mewis told the court through tears that she “feared for her life” in the back of that taxi.
Kerr’s fiancé confirmed it was her who broke the taxi window and confessed she had to “do something dramatic to save us”.
“That’s just how I felt in the moment,” Mewis said.
Mewis said she recalled saying “please stop, please stop” multiple times, but admitted she did not recall who kicked in the divider.
Mr Emlyn Jones asked Mewis if it was an example of her “drunkenness impairing your memory” of what happened.
“No,” she said.
The case continues, with the verdict not expected this week.",SKY News,sports

Police were called to Castle Hill Centenary of ANZAC Reserve War Memorial on Wrights Road after reports came through of a man allegedly displaying a Nazi symbol.
Officers from Castle Hill Police Station confronted a 31-year-old man who was accused of drawing a Nazi swastika on his chest.
He was arrested and taken to Castle Hill Police Station where he was charged with knowingly display by public act Nazi symbol without excuse.
The 31-year-old was granted strict conditional bail and will front Parramatta Local Court on Wednesday March 19.
A spokesperson from New South Wales Police said it is important for the community and police to work together to make the state ""a safer place for everyone"".
The NSW Police Force said they take hate crimes seriously and encourage anyone who is a victim of hate crime or witness a hate crime to report the matter to police through Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 or contact Triple Zero (000) in an emergency.
This comes after two men were charged in a similar incident where a swastika symbol was displayed at a hotel near the Sydney Jewish Museum in February.
Police arrested a 51-year-old and 44-year-old after the two were reportedly involved in displaying a flag showing a Nazi swastika symbol at a hotel on Liverpool Street, Darlinghurst, in Sydney's inner-city.
Anyone in NSW who is found to have displayed a Nazi symbol near a synagogue will be charged with a racial hatred offence and can face a maximum penalty of up to two years in jail.
The law reforms will allow police to have additional power to come down on perpetrators in a bid to tackle racially motivated attacks outside places of worship or during protests.
The Minns government aims to stamp out racially fuelled incidents in NSW after announcing on February 6 there will be tougher racial hate crime laws, following the rise of antisemitic attacks on the Jewish community.

Last week, the Kingston Crown Court heard the Chelsea FC superstar, who described herself as “white-Anglo-Indian”, branded two officers “f**king stupid and white” after she was taken to Twickenham Police Station by a taxi more than two years ago.
Kerr, among women’s football’s most decorated players, was subsequently charged with aggravated harassment of PC Stephen Lovell.
The incident took place after Kerr and her partner had a drunken night out in London, resulting in the football star vomiting in a taxi, a window being smashed and the divider being kicked in.
The court was told that no police officer had searched the taxi for a camera and instead relied on the driver's account, who was never formally interviewed nor has given evidence in the trial.
The pair have claimed they felt they were being kidnapped by the taxi driver who had locked the doors and called the police after the damage was dealt to the vehicle.
On Monday, Kerr’s defence lawyer Grace Forbes told a London court in her closing statements that the police officers’ conduct during the 2023 incident was “utterly indefensible”.
Ms Forbes told the jury in her final remarks that there was not enough evidence from PC Lovell that he had experienced “harassment, alarm or distress” to convict the footballer, as well as leaning on Kerr's intent during the verbal altercation which was captured on a police body camera.
“What cannot be captured on camera was what was going on in Samantha Kerr’s head,” she said.
“Intention is very much in dispute.”
Ms Forbes argued Kerr herself was the best person to explain what she meant by “stupid and white”, with the footballer having expressed in court last week she had “poorly” verbalised her perceptions of the officers’ “power and privilege over me”.
Kerr’s lawyer said it was a “hugely significant” omission on PC Lovell’s part that he failed to express how the “stupid and white” comment made him feel in his first statement, only to include it in another statement 11 months later.
Kerr on Wednesday was asked by her lawyer, Grace Forbes, what she was “trying to express” by calling PC Lovell “f**king stupid and white”.
“I felt like they were treating me differently and not believing me and treating me as a person who had done something wrong because they were in the position of privilege and power and I believe they were treating me differently because of the colour of my skin,” Kerr told the jury.
On Thursday, Prosecutor William Emlyn Jones KC pressed Kerr on her allegedly racially charged comment and asked what the officer’s race “had to do with anything”.
“(It has) nothing to do with race, has it?” Mr Emlyn Jones said, to which the footballer admitted: “not particularly”.
On Friday, the prosecution lawyer said Kerr’s drunkenness would not “save her” and insisted PC Lovell did not “over egg” his claim he was offended by Kerr’s comments.
According to the Daily Telegraph, the jury began deliberating at 3.28pm local time and returned an hour later ahead of the court adjourning without reaching a verdict.

Foreman's family announced the icon's death in a statement on social media.
It is understood he died at his home in Houston, Texas, the same city where he grew up, surrounded by loved ones who said ""our hearts are broken"" by his loss.
""A devout preacher, a devoted husband, a loving father, and a proud grand and great grandfather, he lived a life marked by unwavering faith, humility, and purpose,"" the statement said.
""A humanitarian, an Olympian, and two time heavyweight champion of the world, he was deeply respected - a force for good, a man of discipline, conviction, and a protector of his legacy, fighting tirelessly to preserve his good name - for his family.
""We are grateful for the outpouring of love and prayers, and kindly ask for privacy as we honor the extraordinary life of a man we were blessed to call our own.”
Mike Tyson was one of the first major sportspeople to pay tribute to Foreman, as he shared his respect for the impact he left on boxing.
""Condolences to George Foreman’s family. His contribution to boxing and beyond will never be forgotten,"" Tyson posted on X.
NBA basketball legend Scottie Pippen said Foreman's legacy ""lives on"" while retired Australian boxer Jeff Fenech described him as ""an amazing fighter"" and a ""very, very special man"".
Fenech referred to Foreman as a ""great friend"" who was very private, adding he knew he had been in hospital.
“He wasn’t just a normal person. He was something special,"" he told Code Sports.
“Straight away you think of the rivalry he had with Ali and how big it was. Something like that, I don’t think will ever happen again.
“His comeback in the ‘90s, that’s something you never forget either.""
Foreman's cause of death has not been revealed by his family.
Foreman had one of the most illustrious careers in boxing history, and also showcased tremendous longevity, remaining active in the ring for almost 30 years - retiring in 1997 at 48 after starting his journey in 1969 at the age of 20.
He went 40 matches unbeaten to start his boxing career, including a 38th straight win, to take the WBA, WBC and The Ring heavyweight titles from Joe Frazier.
He suffered his first career defeat to Muhammad Ali in 1974 and only lost a further four bouts to end with a record of 76-5, winning a whopping 68 times by knockout, while he only lost once by knockout - to Ali.
The Hall of Famer went onto further success outside of the ring, becoming a successful entrepreneur as he promoted the George Foreman Grill, which has sold more than 100 million units worldwide since it was introduced in 1994.

'In the deep end': Pierre Gasly defends Jack Doohan's performance after Australian Grand Prix disaster,Reilly Sullivan,https://www.skynews.com.au/australia-news/sport/in-the-deep-end-pierre-gasly-defends-jack-doohans-performance-after-australian-grand-prix-disaster/news-story/6b74c9b3ece32313a9101f90b1451684,"Pierre Gasly has defended his Alpine teammate Jack Doohan’s performance during the rain-soaked Australian Grand Prix after the Aussie crashed out on the first lap.
The 2025 Formula 1 season opened at Albert Park on Sunday and saw McLaren’s Lando Norris win from the pole position after holding off Red Bull’s Max Verstappen and Mercedes’ George Russell.
Heavy rain caused the complete cancellation of the Formula 2 race but conditions improved enough for the Formula 1 to begin as scheduled on Sunday afternoon.
Doohan’s long-awaited debut home race was over within minutes after wild and wet conditions saw the Aussie spin out on the first lap.
The 22-year-old was one of six drivers to fall foul of the wet surface in the drama-plagued race after earlier posting a promising 14th position on the grid during qualifying.
The Aussie’s Alpine appeared to simply slip out from under him at turn six, triggering an immediate safety car.
Doohan’s teammate Pierre Gasly fared only slightly better and finished 11th, meaning Alpine left Albert Park with zero points.
Gasly, 29, defended the Aussie’s overall performance on the weekend and argued the wild weather meant the rookie was “in the deep end”.
“Jack’s been doing a very good job all weekend and it’s just a shame, it was probably throwing him in the deep end with these sorts of conditions,” Gasly told SkyNews.com.au.
“It was probably the toughest conditions on the first few laps, it just felt like we were struggling for grip.”
Gasly said he had full faith in the Aussie ahead of next weekend’s Chinese Grand Prix.
“I’m confident he’ll come back next week and do the job he’s been doing very well,” Gasly said.
The disappointing result comes as Doohan’s long term future at Alpine is under a cloud of doubt amid rumours the French team could replace the Aussie with reserve driver Franco Colapinto.
The lightning fast Argentine competed on the grid in the final nine races for Williams last year, finishing in the top-10 twice, but is currently without a full time seat.
Alpine’s colourful executive advisor Flavio Briatore has refused to rule out replacing Doohan mid season amid rumours the Aussie has just half a dozen races to shape up or ship out.",SKY News,sports
AFL star Jobe Watson forced to call off interstate Noosa wedding amid pending threat of Tropical Cyclone Alfred,Preston Potts,https://www.skynews.com.au/australia-news/sport/afl-star-jobe-watson-forced-to-call-off-interstate-noosa-wedding-amid-pending-threat-of-tropical-cyclone-alfred/news-story/ae783bf6d770d8eac3567767be8c871a,"Jobe Watson's family has revealed the heartbreaking decision to postpone his Queensland wedding due to the incoming threat of Tropical Cyclone Alfred.
The former Essendon captain and Channel 7 commentator was all but ready to say ""I do"" with his fiancé Virginia Slaghekke in Noosa on Saturday, but plans have taken a last minute turn.
The wedding in Noosa has been postponed due to Tropical Cyclone Alfred being likely to cross the coast some time late Friday or early Saturday, bringing sustained winds of 95km/h, gusts up to 130km/h and isolated rainfall upwards of 700mm.
Fellow Essendon champion and father to Jobe, Tim Watson, said on airwaves both families are heartbroken.
“I had to cancel a lot of different things yesterday because we had a very heartbreaking day in our family, because the wedding had to be postponed,” Tim told SEN on Wednesday.
“We were all flying up to Queensland this weekend, and oh my goodness — it’s been a heartbreak of a last 24 hours for everybody.
""This is like the nail, in the coffin, if you want to use that term – which is probably a bit dramatic.""
The decision to cancel the wedding was made on the same day the AFL called off its season-opening fixtures which were expected to take place in Brisbane and the Gold Coast.
Garry Lyon was perplexed when his co-host Watson publicly spoke up about the matter.
“In the scheme of things you had to go through yesterday as a family, I didn’t know you wanted to talk about this publicly,” Fox Footy AFL 360 host Lyon said.
“So this is the point I’ve been trying to make for the last 24-48 hours of whether this game goes ahead or not. It’s big for footy, but not for life.”
The former Melbourne Demons star passed on his sympathy for the Watson family adding how heartbreaking it would have felt to cancel the wedding after so much planning.
""Your poor son, and Virgina and the family, for 18 months have been preparing the wedding of their lifetime,"" Lyon said.
""Beautiful. Up in Noosa (on Queensland’s Sunshine Coast). This is close to our hearts as well because we have a wedding the following week that we hope and pray that everything is going to be OK.
""And you’ve had to call it off. Honestly, my heart goes out to you and your families. Because you’ve had people booked. And travelling. So I think the thing is, for you, the hip pocket is the least of your issues. We’ll get back to it.""
Watson signalled his family's worries are not so serious for other families, who are in the firing line of Tropical Cyclone Alfred in Southeast Queensland and northern New South Wales.
""Everyone will be fine, but the whole thing’s a little bit raw at the moment,"" he said.
Jobe and his Slaghekke became engaged in September 2023 and have had their wedding locked in since August 2024.
The parents to three children first met at a New York café in 2016, when Watson was serving his 12-month AFL doping ban.
Watson was one of 34 players suspended after they were found to have taken a banned substance of AOD-9604 in 2012.",SKY News,sports
Newspaper editor Bevan Shields humiliated on global stage by UFC boss Dana White who branded him the biggest 'wimp on planet earth',Laurence Karacsony,https://www.skynews.com.au/australia-news/sport/ufc-boss-dana-white-hits-out-at-australias-media-industry-branding-journalists-as-biggest-bunch-of-psies-he-has-ever-seen/news-story/857bb1c29fb5e785e5de394c33000f9f,"Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) CEO Dana White has unleashed on the “weak” Australian media industry during a colourful press conference over the weekend, singling out Sydney Morning Herald editor Bevan Shields in a humiliating rebuke of journalism Down Under.
The octagon returned to Australia over the weekend, with the UFC312 event taking place at Qudos Bank Arena in Sydney Olympic Park on Sunday, attracting tens-of-thousands of spectators for the main event fight between the reigning South African champion Dricus Du Plessis and USA’s Sean Strickland.
During the press conference in Sydney, White, 55, praised Australia’s fight talent, the Aussie crowds which swarm to watch the spectacle and the future of the sport, but it did not take long for the fight boss and long-time friend of President Donald Trump to dish it out.
A reporter then asked White about the media “outrage” over the New South Wales government striking a deal with the UFC to host the fighting event in Sydney over the weekend.
White, who had returned to Australia for the sixth time to promote UFC312, pulled no punches and launched into an uncensored tirade against the journalism taking place Down Under.
“For a place that is so tough … everything on land and in the water can kill you, you have the biggest pussies I’ve ever seen in the media in my life,” White said.
ðŸš¨UFC President Dana White slams the entire Australian mainstream media landscape, calling them ""the biggest bunch of pussies"" he's ever seen. pic.twitter.com/nZbEa3eIGs
“I saw a story where the guy was like ‘I saw Dana do a podcast with the Premier and it physically made me sick’ – holy f**king s**t, you guys must have the biggest bunch of p***ies of all time in the media here.
“Just for the record, but go ahead, what’s the question?”
White shone the spotlight on an opinion piece featured in the Sydney Morning Herald, written by editor Bevan Shields, titled: ‘Watching our premier chat to UFC boss Dana White made me feel physically sick’, and was visibly amused at the op-ed.
The opinion piece criticised the UFC boss, but White could not help but laugh, revealing he had read the story about himself chatting with Premier Chris Minns on the Straight Talk with Mark Bouris podcast which left him “cracking up about that guy” who wrote it.
“That guy has to be the biggest f**king wimp on planet earth,” he said.
The UFC CEO was asked to clarify if anyone in the government had spoken to White in the leadup to the event, with the fight boss confirming no one had contacted him.
“Even your f**king people know that your media are weak,” White said.
“They know it, you know it, we all know it now. I didn’t know, now I know.”
White was asked whether he had heard of anybody in the NSW government wanting a fighter other than Sean Strickland, who has a reputation to be politically outspoken, to participate in the UFC events in Australia.
“I do that. Are you kidding me, I do that. It is what it is, you know my stance on this, you know, we’re going to take guys and girls who do a lot of things and say a lot of things, I’m a big believer in free speech,” White said, initially laughing at the question.
“It probably seems worse when you come here because your media are such weak human beings.
“I thought we had weak media (but) you guys win hands down.”
White’s UFC mega event deal with the NSW government has injected millions of dollars into the visitor economy, with the UFC293 event in 2023 selling out in 13 minutes and bagging the state $15.3 million.
In anticipation for the latest event, Mr Minns said in October last year the “huge success” of the UFC events helped showcase Sydney on the global stage as a “top destination” for sport.
“We are continuing to secure a calendar of unmissable events that help local businesses and create jobs, and that’s exactly what these UFC events do,” he said.",SKY News,sports
‘Sad day for tennis’: Nick Kyrgios and tennis world unleash on Jannik Sinner for his controversial three-month doping ban,Preston Potts,https://www.skynews.com.au/australia-news/sport/sad-day-for-tennis-nick-kyrgios-and-tennis-world-unleash-on-jannik-sinner-for-his-controversial-threemonth-doping-ban/news-story/965e1866fde265c302aa96ba2e189f43,"Jannik Sinner has accepted an immediate three-month doping ban from playing tennis with Nick Kyrgios and the tennis world taking aim at the world No.1.
Sinner who recently claimed victory at the Australian Open in January will now serve a suspension from February 9 to May 4 after reaching a settlement with the World Anti-Doping Agency over his two positive doping tests in 2024.
WADA appealed an initial decision from the International Tennis Integrity Agency which had cleared Sinner of any wrongdoing.
WADA confirmed they have entered into a case resolution agreement in the case of the Italian, who has accepted the three-month period of ineligibility for an “anti-doping rule violation” which resulted in the player testing positive for clostebol, a prohibited substance, in March 2024.
“In September, WADA lodged an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in the case of Mr Sinner, who had been found by an Independent Tribunal to bear no fault or negligence,” the agency said in a statement on Saturday.
“Notwithstanding this appeal, the circumstances surrounding this specific case meant that in order to ensure a fair and appropriate outcome, WADA was prepared to enter into a settlement agreement, in accordance with Article 10.8.2 of the World Anti-Doping Code.”
Kyrgios took to social media following the news as he said the decision was a “sad day for tennis”.
“DODGY AS,” he said on X.
“So, WADA come out and say it would be a 1–2-year ban. Obviously, Sinner's team have done everything in their power to just go ahead and take a 3-month ban, no titles lost, no prize money lost.
“Guilty or not? Sad day for tennis. Fairness in tennis does not exist.”
So wada come out and say it would be a 1-2 year ban. Obviously sinners team have done everything in their power to just go ahead and take a 3 month ban, no titles lost, no prize money lost. Guilty or not? Sad day for tennis. Fairness in tennis does not exist.
Kyrgios also posted to Instagram where he said it was a sad day for himself as he has “given a s**t load to this sport”.
“To the future generation tennis players - after today, you can dope, just 'without knowing'... Test positive, play through all the investigation, then settle on a convenient 3-month ban, not get stripped of any money or titles and carry on,” he said.
“Sad day for me - someone who has played this sport since I was 7 years old, battled injury after injury and have given a shit load to this sport. I pray that kids that play this sport do it the right way.”
Former Russian World No. 1 Yevgeny Kafelnikov said: “I just don’t get it! If you are absolutely 100 per cent sure of your innocence (as he was before with his lawyers), why you accepting 3-month ban?? Makes no sense to me”.
English media commentator Piers Morgan gave his two cents as he said: “A ‘settlement’? I didn’t realise drug offence punishments in sport could be negotiated… what a joke”.
Tennis journalist Mark Scoop Malinowski labelled it the worst decision in tennis.
“Sinner getting a three-month vacation for two positive drug tests is probably the worst decision in the history of sport,” he said.
In a statement released by his lawyers, Sinner said he has accepted WADA’s resolve to move on from the doping ban.
“This case had been hanging over me for nearly a year and the process still had a long time to run with a decision maybe only at the end of the year,” he said.
“I have always accepted that I am responsible for my team and realise WADA's strict rules are an important protection for the sport I love.
“On that basis I have accepted WADA's offer to resolve these proceedings on the basis of a three-month sanction.”
The Tennis Integrity Agency had accepted Sinner's explanation that the banned substance clostebol entered his system through a cream which was applied to a cut on his physio's hand.
Sinner will be eligible to play in the next grand slam, the French Open, which starts on May 19. However, the next tournament he can play in is the Italian Open, which begins on May 7.",SKY News,sports

The 32-year-old snowboarder, from Victoria, was competing in her last race of the day on Saturday when she “crashed at relatively high speed and landed on her coccyx”, the Australian Olympic Committee revealed.
The three-time Olympian was airlifted to a hospital in Georgian capital Tbilisi where it was found she had fractured her vertebrae.
Luckily, the world champion has sustained no neurological damage.
She was airlifted to Greece where she is set to undergo surgery.
Brockhoff is being supported by a member of the Olympic Winter Institute of Australia’s medical team, and her partner has also flown to Greece to accompany her.
She is expected to remain in Athens to recover for up to two weeks before she returns to Australia.
“Currently our medical team are working with the medical emergency service personnel and the hospital in Greece to ensure that Belle receives the best care possible,” said Olympic Winter Institute of Australia CEO Geoff Lipshut.
“We will reassess options together with Belle following surgery over the next 48 hours.
“Belle is in good spirits, and I am very pleased that her partner has been able to fly to Greece to support her during this time.”
It comes less than a year out from the 2026 Winter Olympics in Italy.
Brockhoff had only just broken her wrist in a freak accident in November last year, describing how a surgeon deemed it the “worst wrist break they’d ever seen”.
“It was completely shattered, and I have a lot of nerve damage in my little pinkie,” she said, according to the NSW Institute of Sport.
At the 2018 Winter Olympics in PyeongChang, South Korea, she also competed with her right knee taped and in a brace following an anterior cruciate ligament removal.",SKY News,sports
"'Deeply disappointed': Football Australia condemns Triple M host's 'unacceptable' Matildas remarks, calls for responsible commentary on women's sport",Sumaiya Chowdhure,https://www.skynews.com.au/australia-news/sport/deeply-disappointed-football-australia-condemns-triple-m-hosts-unacceptable-matildas-remarks-calls-for-responsible-commentary-on-womens-sport/news-story/156584c02dae906c2cd54819a5e39b9f,"Football's governing body in Australia has condemned radio host Marty Sheargold's sexist on-air remarks about the Matildas, after he joked the women's sports team reminded him of ""year 10 girls"".
During a segment on Triple M, Sheargold made various controversial comments when the the program discussed results from the Matildas, who are currently playing in the United States in the annual SheBelieves Cup along with Japan, Colombia and the host nation.
Results have not gone the way of the Tillies of late, with the squad losing 4-0 to Japan on Friday (AEDT) and then losing a tight game to the US 2-1 on Monday.
“There’s something wrong with the Matildas,” Sheargold said.
“They had that wonderful tournament out here where we all fell in love with them, even though they didn’t make the quarters.
“You know what they remind me of? Year 10 girls.
“All the infighting and all the friendship issues, ‘the coach hates me and I hate bloody training and Michelle’s being a b**ch’.
“Now I’m sorry to undermine the whole sport, but that’s what I think of it so you can stick it up your arse.”
Sheargold finished off his tirade claiming he would rather ""hammer a nail through the head of my p*nis than watch that"", before asking his colleague Will Ralston if his program had ""got any men's sport"".
Football Australia released a statement expressing ""deep disappointment"" after Sheargold began facing mass backlash on social media for his remarks.
""Football Australia is deeply disappointed by the unacceptable comments made by Marty Sheargold on Triple M regarding the CommBank Matildas,"" the statement said.
""Such remarks not only diminish the extraordinary achievements and contributions of our women’s national football team, but also fail to recognise the profound impact they have had on Australian sport and society.
""The CommBank Matildas have inspired a new generation of Australians from young boys and girls to men and women who now see a future for themselves in football and sport more broadly.""
The governing body added that although Triple M and Sheargold apologised for the comments, the incident is a ""stark reminder"" for the media industry to utilise the utmost respect and professionalism when discussing women's sports.
""It is imperative that all media outlets and commentators uphold a standard of respect that reflects the immense contribution of the CommBank Matildas and all female athletes to our sporting culture and Australian story,"" the statement read.
""All female athletes deserve to be covered with the same level of professionalism and respect afforded to their male counterparts.""
*I had to sensor this myself with a beep because the audio was so horrendous
Olympic hockey player Rosie Malone also took to TikTok to share her disbelief over Sheargold's comments, saying they were acceptable on mainstream media.
""I honestly don't know what is wrong with the world"", the Hockeyroo player captioned her video.
""I heard this on the radio yesterday in prime time (5.30pm) on the way to training and all I could think about was the young girls sitting in the car with their parents, maybe on the way to or from their own training sessions hearing this.
""I'm sure many of them would have been hurt and confused... I was in disbelief.
""This is apparently acceptable on mainstream afternoon radio??? HOW??""
The video has now reached over 250,000 views and triggered a wave of complaints to the station.
""Complaint sent to Triple M, sick of hearing his horrific takes across multiple platforms,"" one said.
""Is this a f**king joke?!? I feel like I’m living in a simulation. That cannot be a real recording,"" another added.
However, a handful of comments also sided with Sheargold on the matter.
""I laughed. I love their show, it's just humour and jokes…"" one said.
""HAHAHA thank you I love this, he's actually hilarious x oh no, someone prefers men's sports to womens? Immediately sexist? What about those who only watch women's sport?"" another added.
Southern Cross Austereo and Sheargold have since responded to the incident.
“Marty Sheargold’s comments regarding the Matildas - made during Triple M Drive on Monday, 24 February - do not align with Triple M's views and values, and Triple M remains steadfast in its strong support of all women's and men's sports. We are sorry for any offence caused,"" an SCA spokesperson said.
“Any comedy, including mine, can miss the mark sometimes, and I can see why people may have taken offence to my comments regarding the Matildas. I sincerely apologise,"" Sheargold said.",SKY News,sports

The F1 season begins this weekend at Melbourne's Albert Park and so does Lawson's time under Red Bull Racing, following Ricciardo's exit from the grid.
Lawson lifted the lid on Ricciardo's message of support after he took over from the Aussie after the Singapore Grand Prix in September, and was then elevated to a highly-coveted Red Bull seat alongside superstar Max Verstappen.
The New Zealand racing driver said he had spoken to Ricciardo frequently following his emotional and widely-publicised departure from F1.
“I will always have so much respect for him. Throughout the whole ordeal, from when the rumours started to when they were confirmed, he never said a bad word about or towards me,"" Lawson said in an interview with GQ.
“He never made it about me and him, because at the end of the day, it wasn’t our decision.
“It’s up to the team, and what they decide to do. He was so good to me, through all of it.""
After Lawson landed the highly-anticipated seat at Red Bull, he acknowledged Ricciardo as the only driver past or present who reached out to congratulate him on his promotion.
“Fast forward to December, when I got the Red Bull seat, and Daniel is still the only driver, past or present, to send me a message about it, congratulating me. It says a lot about him as a person,"" he said.
Following Ricciardo's departure after the Singapore race, Lawson recognised the respect he had for him during a tough time for the beloved Aussie.
""It wasn’t a great feeling in Singapore. When I left the track on Sunday, I went and saw him and I said, ‘I’m sorry for this whole situation because I know it sucks and it’s nothing against you,"" he told Sky Sports.
""He said, 'Make the most of this opportunity because you get one shot at F1'. He wished me luck, which I respected massively.""
Ricciardo, who is from Perth, has laid low since his departure from F1.
Recently the 35-year-old has poured his time into his personal brand, Enchanté.
Lawson will be the 10th Kiwi to take on the grid in F1, with the 23-year-old gearing up for a huge weekend when the Australian Grand Prix kicks off between March 13 - 16 at Albert Park in Melbourne.",SKY News,sports
Three Dolphins players withdraw from opening NRL match after choosing to defend their homes amid Tropical Cyclone Alfred,Patrick Staveley,https://www.skynews.com.au/australia-news/sport/three-dolphins-players-withdraw-from-opening-nrl-match-after-choosing-to-defend-their-homes-amid-tropical-cyclone-alfred/news-story/095b5450a6e0300032f81eb414bccfc5,"The Dolphins NRL side has been forced into a reshuffle ahead of the first match of the season, as players stay behind in Queensland to prepare for Tropical Cyclone Alfred.
The Dolphins' start to the season was plunged into chaos when their opening match which was set to be held at Suncorp Stadium in Brisbane was relocated to Sydney.
Commbank Stadium in Parramatta will now host the match which will take place on Friday at 8pm, but some Dolphins players were left concerned with the late change, as they didn't want to leave their homes and families behind during the cyclone.
The change also means the South Sydney Rabbitohs, the Dolphins' opponents no longer have to travel interstate for their first game, and instead will travel to Queensland to face Kristian Woolf's side in June in the fixture reversal.
The players that have withdrawn from the Dolphins line-up are five-eighth Kodi Nikorima, prop Mark Nicholls and forward Kenny Bromwich, who was listed as 18th man.
Sean O'Sullivan has been promoted from the reserves into the halves alongside Isaiya Katoa, Josh Kerr comes onto the bench for Nicholls, and Oryn Keeley joins the reserves in place of Bromwich.
The Dolphins flew out to Sydney on Wednesday night, without the three withdrawn players.
Before he withdrew from the side, Kodi Nikorima's wife Bree made her thoughts clear about the NRL moving the round 1 fixture away from Brisbane's Suncorp Stadium in a furious Instagram post.
""Because a game of football is THAT IMPORTANT,"" she wrote on Instagram.
""Leaving the families behind to ride out the direct line of cyclone alone. Some with no support at all.
""I'm six months pregnant with two young kids in an area that can flood, disgusting.""
Nicholls chose to stay behind after being informed his house is in a danger zone.
The father of three told Dolphins officials of the development as he made the decision to stay home.
Residents in Brisbane, the Gold Coast, the Sunshine Coast are warned they will experience potentially destructive wind gusts of up to 155km/h.

The game will now be moved to CommBank Stadium in Parramatta in Sydney's west with a scheduled start time of 8pm (7pm Queensland time).
Ms Nikorima does not agree with the decision and would rather the game be postponed so players can stay back with families to ride out the imminent cyclone.

""Leaving the families behind to ride out the direct line of cyclone alone. Some with no support at all.

She ended the post with a vomit emoji and the words: ""Do better @nrl.""
Fans voiced their thoughts on Instagram of Ms Nikorima's stance on the situation.
""Damned if ya do, damned if ya don't. Can see what she's saying but it is what it is,"" one said.
""Legit though, postpone it, not hard,"" another added.
""So many inconsiderate people in these comments. Would you want your pregnant wife at home alone in these frightening circumstances? Expected to just protect the house? Be human beings, regardless of class or earnings this isn’t easy on anybody,"" a third said.
The home game for the Dolphins was almost played behind closed doors at Suncorp Stadium, with fans to be locked out from the wild weather for their safety.
Both clubs have now agreed to swap their home games, with Souths to play their Round 17 clash in Queensland instead of Accor Stadium in Sydney.
Rabbitohs CEO Blake Solly said it was in the game's best interest to locate the fixture, while adding he hopes everyone who gets affected by the cyclone stays safe.
""Firstly, we hope everyone in Queensland and northern New South Wales are staying safe and following the advice of authorities with regards to protecting themselves in the face of Tropical Cyclone Alfred,"" he said.
""The advice we received from the Queensland government was to move the game and we have been able to accommodate the move.""
It comes after rival-code the AFL made the call on Tuesday to reschedule Thursday night's season opener between the Brisbane Lions and Geelong Cats at the Gabba.
Saturday's game on the Gold Coast between the Suns and Essendon has also been moved to a future date.

'Unacceptable': Lucy Zelic calls for Sam Kerr to be 'stripped' of Matildas captaincy despite ‘not guilty’ verdict in racial harassment case,Patrick Hannaford,https://www.skynews.com.au/australia-news/sport/unacceptable-lucy-zelic-calls-for-sam-kerr-to-be-stripped-of-matildas-captaincy-despite-not-guilty-verdict-in-racial-harassment-case/news-story/b8c48dda017c4bb84b97707bafbe257c,"Football Australia is under pressure to strip the Matildas captaincy off Sam Kerr, despite a London court finding the Chelsea star “not guilty” of racially harassing a police officer.
Kerr had been charged with one count of aggravated racial harassment after she called a metropolitan police officer “f**king stupid and white” after a drunken night out with her fiancé, Kirstie Mewis, in 2023.
However, a 12-person jury cleared the Matildas star of wrongdoing on Tuesday afternoon, local time, bringing an end to the seven-day trial at Kingston Crown Court.
Football Australia released a statement following the verdict stating they had “remained committed” to supporting Kerr throughout the ordeal.
Despite this, the governing body of Australian football is now under pressure to remove Kerr from her leadership position in the women’s national team, with veteran football journalist Lucy Zelic stating that it is the “morally right” thing to do.
Zelic acknowledged that the court had found the Chelsea star not guilty, but said that there was a different standard for whether someone should be leading the national team.
“To captain one’s country is an extraordinary privilege that comes with immense responsibility and an understanding that you represent each and every one of us,” Ms Zelic told SkyNews.com.au.
“On the balance of evidence, it’s quite clear that Kerr does not represent the values or leadership qualities that the nation would come to expect of a captain, even if this incident did occur off the field.”
Zelic, who is the sister of former Socceroo defender Ned Zelic, said Kerr had made a mistake and she should not lose her career over it, but that she should be “stripped of the captaincy”.
“Football Australia’s stance will prove whether they are more interested in protecting their commercial interests and selling guernseys or honouring what is morally right,” she said.
The comments that led to the trial were made after Kerr was taken to Twickenham Police Station by a taxi during a night that ended with Kerr vomiting in the taxi, the vehicle's rear window being smashed and the divider kicked in.
In a statement after the trial the Matildas captain, who described herself as a “white-Anglo-Indian”,  said she had not intended to insult anyone when she called the two police officers “f**king stupid and white”.
“While I apologise for expressing myself poorly on what was a traumatic evening, I have always maintained that I did not intend to insult or harm anyone and I am thankful that the jury unanimously agreed,” Kerr said.
However, Zelic dismissed the claim that the phrase was not insulting and argued Kerr ought to properly apologise for her actions.
“One of the most confusing reactions to this case have been the assertions that being called “fucking stupid” and “white” are not insulting and that those words ought not to offend someone because they haven’t been exposed to racism,” she said.
“Regardless of the colour of one’s skin or profession, using language like this is clearly designed to denigrate, and invoking someone’s race is entirely unnecessary and unacceptable.
“Football fans who admire Kerr for all of the remarkable things she has achieved in football are demonstrably disappointed with her behaviour. Saying that she’s sorry to the people who expected better from her isn’t asking for too much.”
In its statement, Football Australia acknowledged that national team players held leadership positions which came with added responsibilities, but the governing body stopped short of saying they would strip Kerr of her leadership role.
“Football Australia invests heavily in building the behavioural standards and expectations of all involved with our game, especially for all our national team players, where leadership comes with added responsibilities on and off the field,” FA said.

Fundraiser launched for West Coast Eagles premiership hero Adam Hunter following his shock death,Patrick Staveley,https://www.skynews.com.au/australia-news/sport/fundraiser-launched-for-west-coast-eagles-premiership-hero-adam-hunter-following-his-shock-death/news-story/51159a95ec890e84f34b13c3237d7df5,"Almost $6,000 has been raised in just two days after a fundraiser was launched for the family of former AFL star Adam Hunter.
The 43-year-old was found dead on February 5 about 12.20am inside a home in Bunbury, south of Perth.
The death of the former utility, who won a premiership with the West Coast Eagles in 2006, sent shockwaves through the AFL community and sporting world.
""We are devastated by the loss of 2006 Premiership Eagle Adam Hunter,"" the club said on social media at the time.
""Our thoughts are with his family, teammates and friends.""
A family friend this week started a fundraiser on GoFundMe, on behalf of his loved ones, in a bid to cover funeral costs.
The fundraiser is almost two thirds of the way to reaching its $9,000 target.
""While dealing with the heartbreaking loss of a son, partner and father, Adam’s family is also faced with the financial strain that comes with organising a funeral,"" Corinne Salmon, the fundraiser's organiser wrote.
""The West Coast Eagles have generously helped with the funeral, however there are still other costs which as you can imagine for such a large funeral are quite high.
""Adam gave a lot to our community both on the field and off, let’s give back by supporting his family and helping them give him the send off he deserves. No donation is too small, every little bit counts.""
Ms Salmon added it would be great if the goal were surpassed to ""leave something"" for Hunter's sons.
Hunter's funeral was held on Thursday at Hands Oval in Bunbury.
Guests were asked to donate to Neuropathology Brain Banks in lieu of flowers.",SKY News,sports
Matildas captain Sam Kerr speaks after not guilty verdict in racial harassment case for calling London cop 'stupid and white',Laurence Karacsony,https://www.skynews.com.au/australia-news/sport/matildas-captain-sam-kerr-found-not-guilty-of-racial-harassment-after-calling-london-police-officer-fking-stupid-and-white/news-story/dd05053f2a0f7de37f718400ce455a43,"A 12-person London jury has reached its verdict in finding Matildas captain Sam Kerr not guilty of one count of aggravated racial harassment against a metropolitan police officer after calling him “f**king stupid and white” during a drunken altercation in 2023.
The Chelsea striker left the Kingston Crown Court for the last time, flanked by her security, shortly after 2pm on Tuesday afternoon, local time, marking the seventh day since the trial began.
Last week, the Kingston Crown Court heard the Chelsea FC superstar, who described herself as “white-Anglo-Indian”, branded two officers “f**king stupid and white” after she was taken to Twickenham Police Station by a taxi more than two years ago.
Kerr, among women’s football’s most decorated players, was subsequently charged with aggravated racial harassment of PC Stephen Lovell, an offence carrying a maximum two years imprisonment and a fine of about $5000.
The incident took place after Kerr and her fiancé, Kristie Mewis, had a drunken night out in London, resulting in the football star vomiting in a taxi, a window being smashed and the divider being kicked in.
The women’s football superstar remained expressionless and resolute during the trial and left the court without making a statement to media.
Some four hours later, Kerr released a statement to her social media.
“Following today’s not guilty verdict, I can finally put this challenging period behind me,” Kerr wrote.
“While I apologise for expressing myself poorly on what was a traumatic evening, I have always maintained that I did not intend to insult or harm anyone and I am thankful that the jury unanimously agreed.
“I would like to thank my partner Kristie, my family, friends and all the fans for their love and support, especially those who attended court each day.
“I am fully focused on getting back on to the pitch and look forward to an exciting year ahead for me and my family”.
According to the ABC, Kerr left the dock for the final time with a smile and told a court official “I hope to never see you again”, before hugging her relieved family members.
Kerr gave her legal team, led by criminal barrister Grace Forbes, a thumbs up shortly after the decision was made, according to the Daily Telegraph.
Kerr’s parents Roxanne and Roger, as well as her brother Levi, supported her in court and sat in the front row of the public gallery throughout the trial.
Mewis shed tears of relief when the verdict was read out.
Detective Chief Superintendent Clair Kelland released a statement on behalf of the Metropolitan Police to say the London law enforcement organisation respected the verdict.
""Our officers perform a challenging job and are often subjected to various forms of abuse as they discharge their duty,” the statement read.
""We will continue to support all officers involved in this incident.
""The matter was fully investigated with evidence presented to the Crown Prosecution Service who made the decision to charge.”
The jury was sent away to deliberate on Monday, local time, and were asked to consider three factors to determine the outcome of Kerr’s case, which included whether she intended to cause PC Lovell alarm and distress, and whether she did.
The third element the jury needed to unanimously agree on was whether Kerr, by calling PC Lovell “f**king stupid and white” was racially aggravated harassment.
Kerr said she accepted making the “stupid and white” comments but denied it amounted to a criminal charge.",SKY News,sports
Victoria Park stadium proposal to be recommended to the Queensland government ahead of the 2032 Brisbane Olympics,Patrick Staveley,https://www.skynews.com.au/australia-news/sport/victoria-park-stadium-proposal-to-be-recommended-to-the-queensland-government-ahead-of-the-2032-brisbane-olympics/news-story/c82b3e7aa1c6ca88e20e68dc716f3c6b,"Queensland has reportedly been advised to build a new 60,000-seat stadium in Brisbane ahead of the 2032 Olympics.
An independent panel has recommended the new venue be built in Victoria Park, a heritage-listed space in Brisbane's inner-city, 9News Queensland reported on Friday.
""Sources have now told me the independent panel has recommended the new stadium have 60,000 seats,"" the network's reporter Tim Arvier said.
He said it is understood government officials will review the plan at a meeting of the state cabinet on Monday.
The panel has reportedly found there was not enough time for the 130-year-old Gabba to be rebuilt in time for the Games.
A proposal to use the Queensland Sports and Athletics Centre (QSAC) is also believed to have been rebuffed, as well as Swimming Australia's application for a National Aquatic Centre at Spring Hill.
CEO of the Australian Olympic Committee Matt Carroll didn't confirm whether the government had recommended the Victoria Park venue or not, but said if it were built it would ultimately be an important stadium for Brisbane in the long-term, not just the Olympic Games.
""It's obviously one of the options that have been around for a while and the government wants to build a 60,000 seat stadium but mainly for cricket and AFL,"" he told Sky News host Peter Stefanovic.
""The Olympics and the Paralympics will use it for just one month in July 2032 so we welcome it - but it's got to be for the city. The IOC are very strong on that and I'm sure, I know (new IOC president) Kirstie Coventry is certainly strong on that.
""You build these infrastructure stadiums for the city, for the future, not just for the Olympic and Paralympic Games.""
When pressed by Stefanovic over whether a project in Victoria Park would be ready in time, Mr Carroll had no doubt.
""Yes, it can be built by 2032, and I would imagine their aim would be to have it built by more like 2030-2031 so they can obviously have events in it and get rolling,"" he said.
""It is a great asset for the city if that's the case, but again, it's the decision of the government where they want to go, but we'll wait and see on Tuesday.""",SKY News,sports

Matthew Kuhnemann enjoyed a breakout series as he played in his 4th and 5th Tests for Australia, both in Galle, Sri Lanka.
However, it was revealed on Wednesday by Code Sports' Ben Horne and Robert Craddock, the 28-year-old's bowling action has come under the microscope.
It has not been specified who officially lodged the report against Kuhnemann's bowling.
If a bowler flexes their bowling arm more than 15 degrees it is considered illegal.
The Brisbane talent is now set to undertake mandatory testing in the next three weeks to determine if his bowling action is legal.
A bio-mechanist is expected to analyse his form at Brisbane's Centre of Excellence, before reporting back to the International Cricket Council.
In just his second Test series, Kuhnemann enjoyed a sensational tour of Sri Lanka, picking up 16 wickets at an average of 17.18 over just two matches.
The spinner rapidly returned from an injury to his right thumb, which required surgery after he sustained it during a Big Bash match while playing with the Brisbane Heat, to make the Test squad.
He joined fellow spinners Nathan Lyon, Todd Murphy, and part-timer Cooper Connolly in the squad, but ended up being the pick of the bunch over the two matches.
In the first Test, he played a dominant role with the ball (5/63 and 4/86) as Sri Lanka fell well short, losing by an innings and 242 runs.
The following match he recorded figures of 3/63 and 4/63 as Australia won comfortably by nine wickets.",SKY News,sports
'Flying into the eye of a cyclone': AFL cancels two Opening Round games due to threat of Tropical Cyclone Alfred,Amy Roulston,https://www.skynews.com.au/australia-news/sport/flying-into-the-eye-of-a-cyclone-afl-set-to-postpone-both-qld-opening-round-games-as-tropical-cyclone-alfred-approaches-brisbane/news-story/a4a0b28b59401cc9a58e53f8177b8779,"The ALF has cancelled two Opening Round matches that were set to be held in South East Queensland due to the threat posed by Tropical Cyclone Alfred.
The Brisbane Lions were set to play Geelong in the season opener at the Gabba on Thursday night, with the Gold Coast Suns hosting Essendon at the People First Stadium on Saturday.
However both matches have now been cancelled, with the fixtures to be rescheduled at a later date.
AFL CEO Andrew Dillon said the decision had been made out of an abundance of caution following discussions with the state government, the Bureau of Meteorology and Stadiums Queensland.
""The priority is that we do everything we can to ensure the health and safety of everyone in and around any potential cyclone zone or community impacted by the forecast heavy rains and storm surges,"" Mr Andrew Dillon said.
Tropical Cyclone Alfred, now a category two weather event, is expected to move towards the coastline from Tuesday at a pace of 13 kilometres an hour, with the risk of power being down for at least three days.
The storm is expected to make landfall on Thursday, and Mr Dillon said he did not want the two AFL matches to distract residents from preparing.
""We hope this weather event doesn’t eventuate, but we know everyone needs to prepare accordingly and we don’t want our games to be a distraction to those preparations,"" he said.
The AFL CEO said the league had decided to make the decision now to ""give clubs and fans certainty in an uncertain environment and allow anyone from Queensland who would normally be involved in this game… to be home with their families and available in the community if required"".
The comments come just one day after Mr Dillon said he did not want to make a call until he was ""absolutely 100 per cent confident about what's going to happen"".
However, both Brisbane Lions coach Chris Fagan and Geelong coach Chris Scott urged the league to make a decision sooner.
Speaking to media at a training session at the Gabba earlier on Tuesday, Mr Fagan urged the AFL to put the players' safety first and postpone the game.
""I'm a people first person,"" the Brisbane Lions coach said.
""It's not a tropical thunderstorm, it's a cyclone. I have never been in one, so I don't know what to expect. But I've seen the carnage they've caused at different periods in Australian history.
""I'm not too keen on the idea of things going ahead if it's going to be like that. It can't, can it?
""The sooner the decision’s made, the better.""
Mr Scott also raised his concerns about his team ""flying into the eye of a cyclone”.
""We do need to know, we have some players that are scheduled to get on a plane this afternoon, so we probably need some guidance,"" the Geelong coach told SEN radio on Tuesday morning.
""Even in principle, the idea of getting on a plane and flying into the eye of a cyclone doesn’t sound like a great idea.
“If they (AFL) ask us to do something we feel is inappropriate, then we will make that known at the time, but we are a long way from that position now.”
The AFL did not reveal when the Opening Round games would be rescheduled, but Mr Fagan said the ideal date for the match would be round three, when the Cats and Brisbane both have a bye.",SKY News,sports
New South Wales residents warned to stay alert this summer following detection of Japanese encephalitis in mosquitos,Preston Potts,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/health/new-south-wales-residents-warned-to-stay-alert-this-summer-following-detection-of-japanese-encephalitis-in-mosquitos/news-story/6e2baaca9cbe91d317300b49872ebf86,"New South Wales Health is reminding holiday makers and residents to remain careful this summer after Japanese encephalitis (JEV) was detected in mosquitos around Moree.
While the deadly virus cannot spread from person to person, those who contract it are at risk of severe brain swelling, which can cause permanent damage and death if left untreated.
Common symptoms among those who contract the virus include a fever, headache and vomiting, with more severe cases experiencing neck stiffness, disorientation, tremors, and seizures.
NSW Health executive director of health protection Dr Jeremy McAnulty cautioned residents to be on alert as summer is the season when mosquitos are ""thriving"", raising the risk of infection.
""Each year from November to April, NSW Health undertakes surveillance across the state, to provide important information about when mosquito-borne disease risk is elevated,"" she said.
""Japanese encephalitis (JEV) virus has now been found in mosquitos in the Moree area, in the first results reported from the program this year.
""JE virus was previously detected in mosquitoes in December 2024 in the Griffith area, and in feral pigs in the Narromine Shire local government area.""
While there have so far been no confirmed human cases of JEV, with the last infection in NSW occurring in 2022, Dr Dr McAnulty maintained a large part of the state remained at risk.
""These detections indicate the risk for mosquito-borne virus transmission is widespread, particularly in the 55 NSW local government areas that are at higher risk of JE in the inland regions,"" she said.
""I encourage anyone planning to spend time outdoors in these higher-risk areas to take steps to protect against mosquito bites.""
Hunter New England Health public health physician David Durrheim echoed that warning, saying residents should to take the virus ""very seriously"".
""What we're seeing is probably very widespread mosquito infection with this virus, and we need to take this very seriously,"" he told the ABC.
Dr Durrheim said about one in every 100 people infected develop the disease, with potentially life-threatening consequences.
""For about a third of them the disease can be fatal, and amongst the survivors, about a third of people are left with terrible neurological deficit,"" he said.
A JEV vaccine is available through local General Practitioners, Aboriginal health services and pharmacists, with authorities urging those in and around Moree to seek protection.
In addition to JEV, Murray Valley Encephalitis (MVE) was also discovered in samples coming from chicken flocks in Cowra and West Wyalong in December 2024.
Only a small portion of those who are infected with MVE develop symptoms, but for those who do they include drowsiness and confusion, severe headaches, seizures, and in some cases death.
There is no vaccine against MVE, with NSW Health saying actions such as applying repellent to exposed skin, wearing loose fitted long-sleeve shirts and long pants will give significant protection against the virus.",SKY News,lifestyle
Fresh health alert for measles issued for Western Sydney residents after confirmed case visited medical clinic in Berala,Adriana Mageros,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/health/fresh-health-alert-for-measles-issued-for-western-sydney-residents-after-confirmed-case-visited-medical-clinic-in-berala/news-story/02fc76deb45f02e6e6ff6b3ecd6fe421,"A fresh measles alert has been issued for Western Sydney after a resident visited a local medical clinic while infectious with the highly contagious illness.
New South Wales Health on Thursday confirmed the person recently returned from Vietnam but was not infectious while on their flight.
Several parts of South East Asia are currently experiencing a measles outbreak, including Vietnam which recorded more than 20,000 suspected cases in 2024, according to the country's health ministry.
NSW Health said the Western Sydney resident attended the Family Doctors Berala clinic, at 174B Woodburn Road in Berala, on January 18 from 10am to 11.15am.
While there is no ongoing measles risk at the clinic, anyone who visited the centre on the specified time and date is urged to monitor for symptoms.
South Western Sydney Local Health District Director of Public Health Dr Mitchell Smith said people who attended the clinic should look out for signs of measles until February 5.
""Symptoms to watch out for include fever, sore eyes, runny nose and a cough, usually followed three or four days later by a red, blotchy rash that starts on the head and face, then spreads to the rest of the body,"" Dr Smith said in a statement.
""It can take up to 18 days for symptoms to appear after being exposed, so it's important for people who visited this site at that time to look out for symptoms up until Wednesday 5 February.""
Anyone experiencing symptoms should call ahead before visiting a doctor to avoid spreading measles to others.
Dr Smith reminded the community to keep up to date with their vaccinations, particularly those who intend to travel overseas.
Children aged 12 to 18 months can receive the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine for free, while it is also available at no cost for anyone born after 1965 who has not already had two doses.
""Everyone should check that they are protected against measles, which is highly infectious,"" Dr Smith said.
""Anyone born after 1965 needs to make sure they have had two doses of measles vaccine.
""This is especially important before overseas travel. Measles outbreaks are occurring in several regions of the world at the moment.""
The new alert comes about a month after residents in Sydney's inner west were told to monitor for signs of measles after a European tourist visited several locations while infectious.
Further measles cases also emerged in Victoria last week, with exposure sites in the areas of East Melbourne, Collingwood, Abbotsford and Bentleigh.
Meanwhile, South Australia on Saturday recorded its first measles case for 2025 after a three-year-old child recently travelled from Vietnam.",SKY News,lifestyle
'Thought I was going to die': Man suffers paralysis four times after being bitten by blue-ringed octopus at Balmoral Beach,Sumaiya Chowdhure,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/health/thought-i-was-going-to-die-man-suffers-paralysis-four-times-after-being-bitten-by-blueringed-octopus-at-balmoral-beach/news-story/ca2bb4ca8290b30c3a0fcd17c414e514,"A man who suffered paralysis multiple times and narrowly escaped death after being bitten by a deadly octopus has opened up about his remarkable survival story.
Jaun-Paul “JP” Kalman, 43, was swimming at Balmoral Beach in the afternoon on February 5 when he picked up an oyster shell he found while waist-deep in the water.
After picking the shell up with his toes, he noticed a tiny blue-ringed octopus was attached to his thumb.
“The head of the octopus was the size of a small marble, and its tentacles were wrapped around my knuckle,"" JP told Mosman Collective.
“The creature was magnificent and coloured bright yellow, with flashing blue rings.”
The blue-ringed octopus is one of the ocean’s most distinctive and venomous inhabitants and they like to frequent coastal waters.
Although the creature's vibrant blue rings spark curiosity in many, they are in fact a warning signal for predators and humans to stay away.
When JP quickly shook the tiny critter off his knuckles and felt no pain at first, what happened next caught him completely off-guard.
As reported by Nine News, JP then came out of the water and began googling his symptoms. Within 20 minutes he could no longer feel his thumb.
The father-of-two then called his ex-wife to inform her he'd been bitten and by the time she picked up he had numbed lips, was in a  state of confusion and was having trouble speaking.
“I honestly thought I was going to die,” JP told Mosman Collective.
“I remember my jaw clenched tight, I couldn’t speak, I could hear the doctor saying, ‘open your eyes’, but I couldn’t move.
“My entire body was cramping, and it felt like there was a massive weight pushing down on me, and then my heart rate slowed, I could feel it but couldn’t react because of the paralysis.”
He was rushed into Intensive Care at Royal North Shore Hospital where he was placed in an induced coma for 20 hours.
According to Mosman Collective, when JP woke up he suffered two further paralysis attacks while in hospital.
“Thankfully, they didn’t last very long, and by Friday afternoon I was home,"" he told the publication.
However, the horror continued into the next day when he was shopping at Bridgepoint and suddenly lost all energy inside an Aldi supermarket.
“I had to stop in the aisle, and I knew something wasn’t right,” he said.
“The next thing I was on the ground, completely paralysed.”
JP was rushed to hospital and about four hours later the paraesthesia stopped.
The 43-year-old dad has called himself the luckiest man alive and revealed he is not afraid to still swim in the same spot at Balmoral after his miraculous survival.
“I wish to thank my ex-wife, who saved my life by getting me to the hospital so quickly, and to the medical staff who kept me breathing when I thought I was going to die,"" he said.
“I feel like nothing can beat me now.”",SKY News,lifestyle
"Removal of cancer-linked PFAS from waterways 'increasingly difficult', Senate hearing told, after detection in Blue Mountains",Gemma Crotty,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/health/removal-of-cancerlinked-pfas-from-waterways-increasingly-difficult-senate-hearing-told-after-detection-in-blue-mountains/news-story/8b0fe3bcda03400ef90d9acc9e9c9de0,"A Senate hearing into the detection of PFAS has been told removing the cancer-linked chemicals from waterways is becoming “increasingly difficult”.
It comes after widespread concern was sparked last year following the detection of elevated PFAS levels in the water supply for the Cascade Water Filtration Plant in the Blue Mountains.
Medlow Dam and Greaves Creek Dam were disconnected from the supply following an investigation by WaterNSW.
On Wednesday, Water Services Association of Australia Executive Director Adam Lovell said there was major concern about the levels of PFAS Australians could be exposed to and the costs of removing them.
“We're deeply concerned... about the levels of PFAS that are being allowed to enter the country through thousands of everyday household and industrial chemicals and products,"" Mr Lovell said.
“It's getting increasingly difficult to manage PFAS through the water cycle in more and more catchments… as more sampling is done and we're finding it literally everywhere.""
Mr Lovell went on to stress the high costs of installing treatment plants, saying it would “add hundreds of millions of dollars of capital and operating costs” which would put increasing pressure on water bills.
“You could spend $150 today to buy 1kg of PFAS substance…  to treat that, once it's gone through a wastewater system into biosolids, $4 million to $25 million for that same kilogram of PFAS,” he explained.
“So it gives you an idea, once PFAS is in the chain and once it's sort of circulating through the environment, the costs escalate.”
Sydney Water Executive General Manager Paul Plowman acknowledged PFAS was a “very big concern” among customers in Sydney, but sought to assure residents that “currently, we meet all drinking water guidelines”.
“We've been testing and monitoring our water supply in the context of proposed changes to water guidelines and there's only one system of our nine that would potentially exceed the proposed guideline levels,” he said.
“In response to this we've completed the installation of a treatment process targeted at PFAS chemicals.
“I'm pleased to say as of the 6th of January, all of our systems are meeting not just today's guidelines but what is proposed in the future ones – as Adam says, we take this very seriously.”
PFAS, a large group of synthetic chemicals, are used in a whole host of consumer products and are colloquially known as “forever chemicals” because they take a long time to break down.
Among this group, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) has been classified as “carcinogenic to humans” by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, while perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) has been deemed as “possibly carcinogenic to humans”.
Following the increased detection of PFAS in the Blue Mountains last year, authorities in September assured residents Sydney’s drinking water was safe to consume following testing in the region, with with raw water in dams containing only “negligible” PFAS levels.
In December last year an advanced PFAS treatment system was commissioned at the Cascade Water Filtration Plant, following a recommendation to lower PFAS levels in Australian drinking water in the National Health and Medical Research Council's proposed new drinking water guidelines.",SKY News,lifestyle
Biosecurity Queensland issues alert for serious mosquito-borne virus detected at two piggeries after NSW man hospitalised last month,Sumaiya Chowdhure,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/health/biosecurity-queensland-issues-alert-for-serious-mosquitoborne-virus-detected-at-two-piggeries-after-nsw-man-hospitalised-last-month/news-story/af382d4c80459ab987678d17096cb914,"A fresh alert for Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) has been issued for Queensland residents after the serious mosquito-borne disease was detected in the state's south.
Biosecurity Queensland revealed on Monday the virus had been detected at two piggeries and urged all pig keepers and horse owners to take preventative action to stop its spread.
JEV is a zoonotic disease spread by mosquitoes that can cause reproductive issues in pigs and neurological signs in horses.
""JEV is considered established in mainland Australia, so the detections are not unexpected,"" the Biosecurity Queensland alert read.
""Monitor susceptible animals for any signs of disease and report any suspected cases to your local veterinarian.""
Although rare, the disease can spread to humans via mosquitos which have fed on infected animals, such as pigs or waterbirds.
People who are at most risk of contracting JEV are those who work outdoors or engage in frequent outside activities, as well as those who work at or live close by to piggeries.
Most people infected do not experience any symptoms, but if symptoms arise they will include fever, headache and vomiting.
Those with severe infections may experience neck stiffness, disorientation, tremors, coma, seizures or paralysis.
The latest cases of JEV in Queensland are two of the first detections of the virus in the state since 2022.
Positive cases of the disease have also been emerging in New South Wales and Victoria.
The announcement for Queensland came just a few days after NSW Health released a warning following the hospitalisation of a man infected with JEV while camping in the Murrumbidgee region.
NSW Health's Executive Director of Health Protection Dr Jeremy McAnulty said the recent case of JEV in a human, along with detections in pigs and mosquitoes in NSW, Victoria and Queensland, highlights the risk of infection in a large stretch of NSW west of the Great Dividing Range.
“It is very important for people who live in or travel to these areas to be aware of the elevated risk and to take precautions against mosquito bites. In addition to JE virus, Murray Valley Encephalitis, Kunjin, Ross River, and Barmah Forest viruses can also be spread by mosquito bites,"" he said.
Biosecurity Queensland advised people working with pigs to take steps to control mosquitoes, as well as continue to use effective biosecurity measures.
The most common clinical signs of pigs being infected with Japanese encephalitis are abortions, mummified or malformed foetuses and stillborn or weak piglets.
Pig owners have been  asked to be vigilant for signs of the disease and investigate unexplained abortions or stillbirths.
Vaccinations for JEV are currently the only safe, effective and free method for humans to protect themselves against the virus.
They are available at over 100 vaccination providers across Queensland, including selected GPs, pharmacies and community immunisation providers.",SKY News,lifestyle
Victorians on alert after Japanese encephalitis is detected in two mosquito traps in Moira Shire in the state's north,Patrick Hannaford,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/health/victorians-on-alert-after-japanese-encephalitis-is-detected-in-two-mosquito-traps-in-moira-shire-in-the-states-north/news-story/c0587dc25e15cfe8ddfe56d028f64794,"Victorians are being urged to take precautions after a deadly mosquito-borne disease was detected in the state’s north.
The Department of Health issued an alert on Wednesday after Japanese encephalitis was found in two mosquito traps in Moira shire, north of Shepperton, by the state’s mosquito surveillance program.
There have recently been similar discoveries in NSW, and Victoria has already had a confirmed human case of Japanese encephalitis that was identified in December.
According to the World Health Organisation, symptomatic cases of the disease are rare, but the case fatality rate for those with it can be as high as 30 per cent.
“Most JEV infections are mild (fever and headache) or without apparent symptoms, but approximately 1 in 250 infections results in severe clinical illness,” a WHO fact sheet states.
“...Of those who survive, 20–30 per cent suffer permanent cognitive, behavioural or neurological sequelae such as seizures,  hearing or vision loss, speech, language, memory, and communication problems or weakness of the limbs.”
The WHO says that the majority of Japanese encephalitis cases occur in children below 15 years of age, with the dominant initial symptoms being gastrointestinal pain and vomiting.
“Severe disease is characterized by rapid onset of high fever, headache, neck stiffness, disorientation, coma, seizures, spastic paralysis and ultimately death.”
Victoria’s Chief Health Officer Tarun Weeramanthri urged people visiting northern Victoria to take steps to avoid being bitten by mosquitos.
“Japanese encephalitis virus can cause a rare but potentially serious infection of the brain and is spread to humans through bites from infected mosquitoes,” Dr Weeramanthri said.
“If you’re visiting northern Victoria, particularly inland riverine regions and near the Murray River, you’re potentially at higher risk of infection.
“It’s important to take steps to prevent mosquito bites so cover up, use repellent and limit your time outdoors when mosquitoes are about.”
The Department of Health recommends that those camping or caravaning in high risk areas ensure mosquito screens are intact and to use a mosquito net if screens aren’t available, close doors and tent flaps to stop mosquitoes getting inside, and try to avoid camping near wetland habitats where mosquitoes are likely breeding.
There is no cure for Japanese encephalitis.
Treatment may include medication and admission to hospital, with the aim being to reducing the severity of symptoms and supporting the patient to overcome the infection.

Environmental watchdog to test popular New South Wales beach for cancer-linked 'forever chemicals',Preston Potts,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/health/environmental-watchdog-to-test-popular-new-south-wales-beach-for-cancerlinked-forever-chemicals/news-story/2d1f53f6c0c5de0862cd2d0a92df6eaa,"The New South Wales environmental watchdog has carried out testing at a popular beach in Sydney after concerns were raised over potentially contaminated water.
Botany Bay's Tower Beach, located next to Sydney Airport, may have been exposed to cancer-linked ""forever chemicals"", specifically those known as per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS).
PFAS are made up of about 15,000 chemicals resistant to heat, grease, stains, and water - leading to the moniker of ""forever chemicals"" due to the fact they do not break down.
Dietary advice for fish caught off the beach in 2018 said PFAS had been detected in some species and that consumption should be limited, but no signage was placed on and around the shore to remind locals of the risk.
Fishers and swimmers are seen enjoying the beach most days.
On Wednesday, a NSW Environmental Protection Agency spokesperson confirmed authorities had taken samples from the area for testing, after Airservices Australia detected PFAS in and around the surface and groundwater.
Limited sampling and testing of fish and sediments was also conducted for the first time since 2018, according to the environmental watchdog.
""In 2018 the NSW government proactively tested commonly caught fish in Botany Bay and the Georges River, including Tower Beach, in response to concerns about potential PFAS contamination,"" the spokeswoman told Skynews.com.au.
""The current precautionary dietary advice remains in place; however, PFAS use in firefighting foam is being phased out and any offsite impacts have been reduced over the last few years.
""The EPA will arrange for further testing to confirm the precautionary dietary advice is still valid.
""We would also consider any results related to Sydney Airport shared by the airport or Commonwealth government.""
The NSW EPA listed Botany Industrial Park and Sydney Airport as contributors to the presence of PFAS, due to the constant use of firefighting chemicals.
The news of more testing comes after residents in the area were left frustrated about the minimal news surrounding the quiet closure of the beach.
Local resident Terry Daly told Nine newspapers he was upset it took months to discover why the beach was shut, after seeing a sign put up in 2023.
""Tiny kids are playing on the sand there all the time,"" he said.
The NSW EPA said the signage on the Botany Bay foreshore is not their responsibility.
John Dee, who started Stop PFAS group, said the risks of PFAS are not being properly managed, with the Botany Bay area having ""serious"" levels of contamination.
""To stop that, we need a single public authority with comprehensive responsibility for overseeing PFAS contamination management and removal,"" he told AAP.
""The risks of PFAS are not being appropriately managed... authorities have known for years that this area has serious levels of PFAS chemicals and they've not done anywhere near enough to protect the public from the health impacts of these forever chemicals.""",SKY News,lifestyle
NSW Health pleads with residents to protect themselves against mosquitoes after second Japanese encephalitis death,Bryant Hevesi,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/health/nsw-health-pleads-with-residents-to-protect-themselves-against-mosquitoes-after-second-japanese-encephalitis-death/news-story/d45d7001151c4d584c20954e21d0fd67,"New South Wales has now recorded two deaths from a mosquito-borne disease this year, with authorities pleading with residents to take steps to avoid being bitten.
Authorities on Friday confirmed a man in his 70s who had been in hospital receiving care for Japanese encephalitis died last week.
He acquired JE while on holiday in the state's Murrumbidgee region, NSW Health said.
His death came less then a month after another man who was also aged in his 70s and had holidayed in the Murrumbidgee passed away in a Sydney hospital, just weeks after acquiring JE.
There have now been four deaths overall since the first case of JE was recorded in NSW in 2022. The other two deaths were reported that same year.
NSW Health said it has also identified a probable case of JE infection in a man aged in his 20s, who resides in the state's north.
""He likely acquired the infection in the north-west of the state when travelling between Moree Plains, Tamworth and Gunnedah shires,"" NSW Health said.
""He has been discharged from hospital and is recovering at home.""
No specific treatment is available to individuals who are infected with JE, which is spread to humans by mosquitoes and can also result in severe neurological illness.
Residents are being urged to protect themselves from mosquitoes, especially those who live in areas of the state which have recently been hit by heavy rainfall.
""People need to take mosquito-borne infections seriously, especially as people start the clean-up from recent floods in an environment where mosquitos thrive,"" NSW Health's Executive Director of Health Protection Dr Jeremy McAnulty said.
""Standing water, like that left after mass rainfall and floods, makes for ideal breeding grounds for mosquitoes.
""This increases people's risk of being bitten, especially if they're working outdoors.""
Measures to avoid being bitten include putting repellent on exposed skin, wearing long pants, light, loose-fitting long-sleeve shirts and covered footwear, avoiding being outside when mosquitos are most active such as dawn and dusk, using insecticide sprays and using a tent with fly screens if camping.
Residents can also get vaccinated against JE.
""JE vaccine is available through local General Practitioners, Aboriginal health services and pharmacists to anyone who lives or routinely works in various inland LGAs or high-risk occupations. It is free for people who meet the eligibility criteria,"" NSW Health said.
""People should make an appointment and let the provider know it is for the JE vaccine, as they may require a few days' notice to order the vaccine.""",SKY News,lifestyle
Expert's warning on the health risks of floodwaters as south-east Queensland and northern NSW are battered by Tropical Cyclone Alfred,Patrick Staveley,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/health/experts-warning-on-the-health-risks-of-floodwaters-as-southeast-queensland-and-northern-nsw-are-battered-by-tropical-cyclone-alfred/news-story/0dbb2e7359c9623fb6f066d6566cc1d1,"A health expert has warned Australians what to do and what not to do if they come into contact with floodwaters during Tropical Cyclone Alfred.
Tens of thousands of residents in low-lying areas of northern NSW have been told to evacuate immediately or closely monitor river levels as rain falls ahead of Tropical Cyclone Alfred's arrival.
The SES has issued more than 100 flood warnings stretching from Tweed Heads on the Queensland-NSW border down to Forster, north of Newcastle.
Several flood watches are also in place in Queensland as the state's south-east cops heavy rainfall.
Sky News Australia meteorologist Rob Sharpe said the worst aspect of the cyclone ""is probably going to end up being the flooding rainfall"".
Public health professor at the University of Queensland Simon Reid said the ""most urgent"" health risk that could affect people if they come into contact with floodwaters is leptospirosis.
Leptospirosis can be caused by direct or indirect contact with mud and water, with the first symptoms occurring within about a week of exposure.
Symptoms include high fever, sore muscles, eyes and a headache.
""The most common factors are people entering water or coming into contact with mud, especially when cleaning up. The bacteria enters the body through cuts/abrasions and mucous membranes (the pink lining  of eyelids, nose and mouth),"" Professor Reid said.
""This is a potentially fatal disease in rare cases where multiple organs can be involved. If it is treated early (within 3 days of symptoms) then it is easily treated with a course of antibiotics. The main message is for people to present early to their GP or hospital if they have symptoms following exposure.""
Professor Reid said cellulitis could also affect people if they have any cuts or abrasions that are infected.
""People need to keep cuts and abrasions clean, disinfected and managed with dressings. If they notice red and painful swelling or they have a fever then they should immediately consult a GP to get proper management,"" he urged.
He also said damage to sewage infrastructure could lead to faeces entering floodwater or water supply, which could cause diseases such as gastroenteritis.
""The main prevention is to follow directions regarding avoidance of floodwater, boil water if instructed to do so. If anyone has symptoms for longer than three days or they are beginning to feel incapacitated, then they should seek medical care,"" he said.
""The standard treatment is rest, reduce food intake, drink plenty of water/rehydration fluids. Care must be taken looking after young children and older adults who can be more vulnerable to the fluid and electrolyte loss that occurs.""",SKY News,lifestyle
"NSW Health warning after one person dies, two hospitalised following overdoses on substance believed to be cocaine",Bryant Hevesi,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/health/nsw-health-warning-after-one-person-dies-two-hospitalised-following-overdoses-on-substance-believed-to-be-cocaine/news-story/27e41b4bebca019ed2ceb8d01691d64e,"One person has died and two others have been hospitalisted after overdoses in New South Wales, prompting authorities to issue a major public health warning.
A statement from NSW Health on Tuesday said the trio had presumed the white powder they were taking this past week was cocaine.
However, they subsequently started experiencing ""severe sedative effects and altered behaviour"" as the substance contained a number of other drugs.
""The white powder associated with the cases was presumed to be cocaine by those using it, but was found to contain bromazolam, a type of benzodiazepine with strong, sometimes unexpected effects and 2C-B, a hallucinogen,"" health authorities said.
NSW Poisons Information Centre Acting Medical Director Professor Andrew Dawson noted that a danger posed by illicit drug supply ""is the strength and contents of the substance you are getting is unknown and can be inconsistent"".
""Anyone who experiences unexpected sedative effects such as difficulty speaking or walking, drowsiness, loss of consciousness, slowed breathing/snoring and skin turning blue/grey should seek medical care immediately,"" Professor Dawson said.
""If you are feeling unwell, stay with friends or around other people. Don't go home alone to sleep it off.
""Stimulants such as cocaine have also been found containing opioids. It's strongly recommended that anyone who uses illicit drugs carry naloxone.
""Although naloxone does not reverse the effects of benzodiazepines or hallucinogens, if you are concerned that someone is having an overdose, naloxone is safe to use in these circumstances.""

Naloxone can reverse the effects of opioid overdose, but only temporarily.
It can be delivered as a nasal spray or an injection, but as it only lasts 30 to 90 minutes, those who administer it need to immediately contact triple-0 for an ambulance.
""You won't get into trouble for seeking medical care. If you feel unwell, or if your friend feels unwell, do something about it,"" the NSW Health statement said.
Take home naloxone can be obtained without cost or a prescription from some pharmacies, as well other health services including alcohol and drug treatment centres.

'Not going away': COVID cases have doubled across Queensland this festive season as new strain spreads across state,Preston Potts,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/health/not-going-away-covid-cases-have-doubled-across-queensland-this-festive-season-as-new-strain-spreads-across-state/news-story/70daefabcf6ca055282c9d7bd6625cc5,"Queensland is in the grip of a COVID outbreak as a mutating strain sweeps the state, with the number of hospitalisations ""rapidly increasing"" .
A spike in cases is leaving one in five Queenslanders who contract COVID being sent to hospital.
Queensland Chief Health Officer Dr Heidi Carroll warned the virus ""is not going away"", as she revealed an average of 258 Queenslanders were being hospitalised each day.
That is a 128 per cent increase in admissions over less than two weeks.
Over the past fortnight, 44 per cent of the detected cases in the Sunshine State were found to be the variant XEC - the newest COVID strain to hit Australia.
Dr Carroll said most hospitalisations were coming from older Australians and people who were not up to date with their booster shots.
""Most of those being hospitalised are over the age of 65 and not up to date with vaccinations, so I can't stress enough the importance of being vaccinated against COVID-19,"" she said.
""Those aged 65 years and older continue to be at greater risk from COVID-19 and I'm very concerned about the rapidly increasing number of elderly Queenslanders being hospitalised.""
The Chief Health Officer stressed the state can ""halt"" the momentum of COVID if people ensure they take steps not spread the virus this holiday season.
""We're now in peak festive gathering season, which unfortunately means Queenslanders are at greater risk of catching and spreading the virus,"" she said.
""Don't be the person who gives the unwelcome gift of COVID-19 over Christmas and New Year.
""We can halt the momentum of this COVID-19 wave if people ensure their vaccinations are up to date, especially our most vulnerable, stay home if they are unwell and practise good hygiene.""
As of mid-December, there were 305 COVID patients in hospitals across Queensland, with 77 per cent being aged 65 years and older.
Between December 9 and 15, the daily average number of COVID patients occupying public hospital beds more than doubled, increasing from 113 to 258.
Over the year to December 15, Queensland has recorded 70,023 cases, with 13,464 of those being admitted to hospital.
Associate Professor Institute for Biomedicine and Glycomics at Griffith University Dr Lara Herrero said the mutating variant of XEC is on the verge of becoming the dominant strain of COVID globally, and looks likely to spread in the warmer months.
""We don't know why yet, but reports suggest it may be able to spread more easily than other variants,"" Dr Herrero said.
""It's hard to predict how XEC will behave in Australia as we head into summer. We'll need more research to understand more about this variant as it spreads.
""But given XEC was first detected in Europe during the northern hemisphere's summer months, this suggests XEC might be well suited to spreading in warmer weather.""",SKY News,lifestyle
Professor Ralph Mobbs hails 'Band-aid back surgery' with new technique set to improve thousands of Australians' lives,Max Melzer,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/health/professor-ralph-mobbs-hails-bandaid-back-surgery-with-new-technique-set-to-improve-thousands-of-australians-lives/news-story/137737e5f5dd3808e12da4986b364675,"A new technique, known as ""Band-aid back surgery"", is being hailed for significantly improving the quality of care for those suffering spinal conditions.
The procedure, which is formally referred to as an endoscopic laminectomy, allows surgeons to remove part of the patient's spine in order to relieve pressure on the spinal cord or nerves.
Most laminectomies are conducted after more conservative treatments - such as medicines, physical therapy or injections - fail to provide results, as the procedure can result in significant pain during recovery and impair the movement of some patients for months.
However, according to Professor Ralph Mobbs the utilisation of an endoscope, a small camera attached to a length of cord, has ""revolutionised"" the procedure, significantly improving quality of care.
""The endoscopy has revolutionised women's surgery, abdominal surgery, prostate surgery, and we're now seeing that transition into the spine,"" he told Sky News Australia.
""Most patients are pleasantly surprised.
""They have chatted with their friends, they've heard horror stories about months of long recovery and they've had an intervention from which they return a week or two later and they say 'you know, I didn't have much pain here, I'm back doing pretty much everything I want to be doing and more'.""
Professor Mobbs has led the way in use of the operation in Australia, making the most of support from the Prince of Wales Private Hospital in Sydney.
The hospital began investing in the surgery around four years ago in the hope of improving outcomes for those suffering spinal conditions.
Along with colleagues, Professor Mobbs performs up to 15 ""Band-aid"" back surgeries each week and helps to train other surgeons in the technique.
""At the moment there's around about 10 surgeons (who can perform the procedure) across Australia,"" he said.
""However, that number is increasing rapidly as the benefits are pretty obvious.""
One such benefactor is cellist Georg Pedersen, who reported a remarkable improvement in his chronic back pain following the operation.
""I couldn't believe it when I woke up after the operation, there was absolutely no pain, of any kind, anywhere,"" he told Sky News Australia.
""I can do everything I want now, play the cello, walk to everything, so, it just gave me a new lease on life.""
Thousands of Australians could be set to benefit from the surgery in the years to come, with the procedure commonly used to treat those suffering from spinal stenosis, bone spurs and bulging discs.
As with any medical procedure, the operation does carry risks, with Professor Mobbs advising those suffering from spinal conditions to first consult a specialist before making a decision to undergo surgery.",SKY News,lifestyle

The state's health department on Tuesday said a northern Victoria resident was a probable case of JE virus infection, which can have serious health effects.
A statement issued by Acting Chief Health Officer Dr Christian McGrath said it was ""the first identified case of JE in Victoria this mosquito season"".
""JE virus has also been detected through environmental surveillance in northern Victoria, and in mosquitoes and feral pigs in New South Wales this summer,"" the statement said.
""These findings indicate that JE virus is likely circulating in northern Victoria this summer.""
The virus, which was first detected in Victoria two years ago, is spread to humans through the bite of a mosquito infected with JE.
It can cause fever, vomiting and a headache, as well as seizures, movement disorders and generalised weakness.
The virus can also result in ""a rare but potentially serious infection of the brain"".
""Residents and people visiting northern Victoria, particularly inland riverine regions and near the Murray River, are potentially at higher risk of infection and should take measures to prevent mosquito bites,"" the statement said.
""Avoid mosquito bites by using mosquito repellent containing picaridin or diethyltoluamide (DEET) on all exposed skin.

The unpleasant discovery was made in Shoreham Reservoir during a maintenance inspection on Thursday.
The alert, issued by the Department of Health and Human Services via Victoria Emergency just before midnight, is active for those living in the towns of Flinders, Point Leo and Shoreham.
Residents who live or work within these areas are being told tap water is ""not safe to drink"" or use without boiling first.
Utility company South East Water, which has released a Precautionary Boil Water Advisory notice, is testing water quality in the region to determine the extent of any contamination.
""E. coli itself is not necessarily harmful, but finding it means that the drinking water may be contaminated with other germs that can cause illness,"" the alert read.
""Low water pressure and interruptions to water supply can lead to a build-up of bacteria that can make people sick.""
Health authorities have warned water contaminated with germs may lead to diarrhoea, cramps, headaches, or other gastro like symptoms and stomach pains.
""Infants, children, pregnant women, the elderly and immuno-compromised people are particularly at risk,"" the warning said.
Residents are being urged to either boil tap water before consumption, or drink bottled water.
Tap water should also be boiled for cleaning fruit and vegetables, preparing food or baby formula, and making ice cubs.
Water needs to be boiled for brushing teeth, while children should take cooled boiled or bottled water to school, authorities said.
Water sourced from the tap should also be boiled for livestock and pets.
In the meantime, drinking water can be sourced from Flinders Civic Hall located at 54 Cook Street, as well as Shoreham Recreation on Reserve Cliff Road, according to VicEmergency.
Residents are being told drinking water is expected to be impacted until testing results are received, with the next update on the situation due to be delivered by 5pm on Friday.

""A new case of measles has been identified in Victoria, after travel overseas to Pakistan where there has recently been a large measles outbreak. There have now been 18 cases of measles identified in Victoria in the last 12 months,"" the alert said.
""Measles is a highly infectious viral illness that can lead to uncommon but serious complications, such as pneumonia and brain inflammation (encephalitis).
""At the present time, any overseas travel could lead to exposure to measles, with outbreaks reported in multiple countries and regions, including Vietnam, Thailand, India, Africa, Europe and the UK, the Middle East, and the USA.""
Other public exposure sites include the Melbourne Airport international arrivals hall between 12:30am to 1:30am on February 4.
The Monash Children's Hospital Paediatric Emergency Department (9.20pm to 10.45pm on February 8) and Monash Medical Centre emergency department (9pm to 9.50pm on February 8) are also listed as exposure sites, with the full list on the department's website.
The latest case comes just a week after an individual who returned to Australia at 12.45am on January 26 on a VietJet Air flight from Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam was confirmed to have measles.
""The total number of cases linked to travel in Vietnam since December 2024 now standing at eight,"" the health department said last week.
On Monday, Dr Weeramanthri issued a health advisory urging Victorians to seek advice from their GP at least six to eight weeks before heading overseas to check what vaccinations they require based on their travels to prevent outbreaks when they return home.
UPDATE: A new case of measles has been reported in Victoria. The case has recently returned from Pakistan. This is in addition to the measles case reported on 7 February 2025.Read more: https://t.co/rf4atM0RGM
""Victorians travelling overseas are at increased risk of a range of vaccine preventable diseases, including measles, respiratory infections (e.g. influenza and COVID-19), gastrointestinal illnesses (e.g. hepatitis A, typhoid) and mpox. Vaccines are available to protect against these diseases,"" the advisory said.
""Some of these diseases occur infrequently in Australia but are endemic (i.e. widespread) in other countries. They can be imported into Australia by returning travellers who are infected while overseas.

NSW Health issues urgent alert after measles-infected traveller from Vietnam visited a series of locations across Sydney,Sumaiya Chowdhure,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/health/nsw-health-issues-urgent-alert-after-measlesinfected-traveller-from-vietnam-visited-a-series-of-locations-across-sydney/news-story/e45b972d9b4852a62a92064e7a32494e,"NSW Health has urged residents to stay on high alert for signs and symptoms of measles after a confirmed case from Vietnam boarded an international flight while infectious and travelled to multiple locations in Sydney.
Vietnam is currently experiencing an ongoing large outbreak of measles, which is a highly contagious viral illness.
Those who were on board Jetstar flight JQ62 from Ho Chi Minh to Sydney at 10.40pm on March 9, and also were then at baggage claims at Sydney International Airport upon arrival have been told to watch for symptoms.
The patient with the confirmed case also made their way to the city's east and visited 169 Cafe in Randwick and Ooshman Maroubra on March 10, then Matraville Medical Complex and Princes of Wales Hospital Emergency Department from March 13 to March 15.
South Eastern Sydney Local Health District Director of Public Health, Dr Vicky Sheppeard, said people who visited the above locations should monitor their health until April 2, as it can take up to 18 days for symptoms to appear after an exposure.
Measles is spread through the air when someone who is infectious coughs or sneezes.
“Symptoms to watch out for include fever, runny nose, sore eyes and a cough, usually followed three or four days later by a red, blotchy rash that spreads from the head to the rest of the body,"" Dr Sheppeard said.
“If they develop symptoms, they should call ahead to their GP or emergency department to ensure they do not spend time in the waiting room with other patients.
“We want to remind the community to make sure they are up to date with their vaccinations. The measles vaccine can prevent the disease even after exposure, if given early enough.
“Anyone born after 1965 needs to ensure they have had two doses of measles vaccine. This is especially important before overseas travel, as measles outbreaks are occurring in several regions of the world at the moment.""

South Australia Health released the alert late Saturday after being notified a three-year-old child infectious with measles had recently travelled from Vietnam.
The child travelled on flight SQ279 from Singapore to Adelaide, landing in the capital city about 8.45am on January 14.
Passengers on the flight are being urged to monitor for symptoms of measles, as well as anyone in Adelaide Airport from 9.00am to 10.00am.
Further exposure sites include Kmart at Ingle Farm Shopping Centre in Adelaide's north-east on January 15 from 6pm to 7pm, as well as the adjacent Coles between 6.30pm to 7.30pm.
AdelaideMRI Parafield, located on 33 McIntyre Road in Para Hills, was a hot spot on January 16 from 3.15pm to 4.30pm.

Anyone who visited the Women’s and Children’s Hospital Emergency Department on January 17 from 11.30am to 12.10pm should also monitor for symptoms.
SA Health has urged anyone who believes they have contracted the illness to contact their GP.
Measles typically starts with a fever, sore eyes, runny eyes and cough, usually followed about four days later by a blotchy red rash that spreads down the body.
""When measles is suspected, it is very important that people phone the doctor or medical clinic before attending so precautions can be taken to avoid spreading the disease to others,"" SA Health said in a statement.
Health authorities have urged residents to check their vaccination status against measles.
""Immunisation provides the best protection against measles and it’s vital that everyone makes sure they’ve had two doses of the measles vaccine to protect themselves and the community,"" SA Health said.
Anyone born during or after 1966, and has not received two measles vaccines, can visit their GP or local council immunisation clinic for a measles vaccine, SA Health said.
Children generally receive their first measles vaccination at 12 months with a second dose administered at either 18 months or four years of age.

Tom O'Neill died on December 31 from a suspected medical episode.
A coroner is yet to determine the official cause of his death, but it is believed Mr O'Neill suffered a fatal seizure in his sleep.
The eldest of the 22-year-old's 11 siblings, Jack O'Neill, opened up about his younger brother's health obstacles throughout his childhood.
""He was diagnosed with meningitis when he was three-months-old and then developed epilepsy,"" he told the Geelong Advertiser.
Mr O'Neill was a qualified horticulturalist, who had a passion for avid gaming, volunteering, marathon running and a dedication towards self-improvement.
Jack highlighted his brother's caring nature, and loyalty to his friends.
""One of his friends from Gippsland had a tough day, so Tom drove up there that night, stayed for half an hour, had coffee with him, and then drove back the same night to get to sleep for work the next morning at six o'clock,"" Jack told the publication.
""I think that story highlighted to me the type of caring person he was.""
The O'Neill family have created a GoFundMe page, as they look to raise essential money for the cost of Tom's funeral.
The fundraiser had surpassed its goal of $20,000 on Friday afternoon, with 246 people having donated at the time of publishing.
The family said Tom will be ""sorely"" missed, as the O'Neill's requested support during this ""difficult time"".

Experts 'watching closely' but no 'immediate concerns' Chinese HMPV outbreak could spark COVID-19 repeat,Max Melzer,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/health/experts-watching-closely-but-no-immediate-concerns-chinese-hmpv-outbreak-could-spark-covid19-repeat/news-story/d44f68ac4d484899df133edf3c137611,"Health experts are ""watching closely"" as China struggles to control a spike in human metapneumovirus (HMPV) cases, although they maintain the outbreak is unlikely to develop into a repeat of COVID-19.
HMPV is a flu-like virus which is particularly dangerous for children, the elderly and the immunocompromised.
Common symptoms including coughing, fever, a blocked nose, and shortness of breath, but the virus can also develop into more serious illnesses such as bronchitis and pneumonia.
Chinese state media has reported rising cases of HMPV over the past several weeks, while social media in the country is awash with images and videos of packed hospital waiting rooms.
Unverified reports online have also suggested funeral homes are becoming overwhelmed.
The surge in cases has prompted comparisons with the early days of the COVID pandemic, leading health authorities in China and some surrounding nations to issue public reassurances about the risk posed by the flu-like virus.
Speaking to Skynews.com.au on Wednesday, epidemiology chair at Deakin University Catherine Bennett also sought to downplay the threat posed by HMPV to other nations.
""This is not a new virus but rather one that we have seen before and which contributes to our seasonal respiratory disease, especially in the very young and very old,"" she said.
""Given the number of hospitalizations that seem to be attributed to this, other countries, including us, are watching closely in case this signals a more virulent strain, but we will have some immunity to this virus, unlike COVID-19 initially, and so would have to be a very different strain to escape our immunity and have severe enough illness comity to lead to a major response.""
Professor Bennett's assessment was backed up by Australian National University infectious diseases specialist Associate Professor Sanjaya Senanayake, who maintained that while the outbreak was a ""priority"" for China's health system ""it should not lead to immediate concerns about a new pandemic"".
Associate Professor Senanayake explained the spike ""should settle down"", likening the current surge in cases to the yearly flu season.
""At this stage, the likelihood is that China is experiencing a bad HMPV season, in the same way that in some years we have an overwhelming flu season,"" he told Skynews.com.au.
""This could be due to a combination of viral and behavioural factors, but it should settle down.""
Health authorities in India, Cambodia and Taiwan have said they are closely monitoring the situation, but have yet to suggest there is cause for alarm.
However, there is pressure on Beijing to ensure transparency as China responds to the outbreak,  with Associate Professor Senanayake explaining data sharing was paramount in ensure any potentially harmful mutations in the virus were found early.
""It is also vital for China to share its data on this outbreak in a timely manner. This includes epidemiologic data about who is getting infected,"" he said.
""Also, we will need genomic data confirming that HMPV is the culprit, and that there aren't any significant mutations of concern. Such genomic data will also guide vaccine development.""
China has previously faced criticism over its repeated failure to share data about COVID-19, with the World Health Organisation calling the release of information a ""moral and scientific imperative"" in a statement marking five years since the pandemic began.",SKY News,lifestyle
Fresh warnings for serious mosquito-borne virus emerges after man infected with Japanese encephalitis while camping in southern NSW,Sumaiya Chowdhure,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/health/fresh-warnings-for-serious-mosquitoborne-virus-emerges-after-man-infected-with-japanese-encephalitis-while-camping-in-southern-nsw/news-story/bed931d146a18e46d015944705930058,"NSW Health has issued fresh warnings for a serious mosquito-borne illness which led to the hospitalisation of a man after becoming infected while camping in the Murrumbidgee region.
The case is understood to be the first one this summer.
NSW Health's Executive Director of Health Protection Dr Jeremy McAnulty revealed the man most likely acquired the infection in late December or early January while holidaying.
Japanese encephalitis is a rare but serious illness which is spread to humans by infected mosquitos.
The virus is spread when a mosquito bites an animal such as pigs or waterbirds that has the Japanese encephalitis virus and then it bites a human while infected.
The disease is not contagious to other humans and cannot be acquired from touched infected animals.
However, Dr McAnulty said the recent case, along with detections in pigs and mosquitoes in NSW , Victoria and Queensland, highlights the risk of JE virus infection in a large stretch of NSW west of the Great Dividing Range.
“It is very important for people who live in or travel to these areas to be aware of the elevated risk and to take precautions against mosquito bites. In addition to JE virus, Murray Valley Encephalitis, Kunjin, Ross River, and Barmah Forest viruses can also be spread by mosquito bites,"" he said.
People who are at most risk of contracting the JE virus are those who work or engage in frequent outside activities, as well as those who work at or live close by to piggeries.
Most people infected do not experience any symptoms but if symptoms arise they will include fever, headache and vomiting.
Those with severe infection may experience neck stiffness, disorientation, tremors, coma, seizures or paralysis.
Dr McAnulty said there is a safe, effective and free vaccine to protect against the virus.
""It is available to anyone who lives or routinely works in various inland LGAs as well as for people who work in some other high-risk occupations,"" he said.
JE vaccine is available through local general practitioners, Aboriginal health services and pharmacists.",SKY News,lifestyle

Victoria's Chief Health Officer Dr Tarun Weeramanthri issued an alert on Wednesday over the ""significant increase in cases"" of Q fever, a disease spread to humans through animals.
“Q fever can cause long-term health complications including heart disease and chronic fatigue, which can last for many years,” the health advisory states.
Individuals most at risk are those who work with animals, animal products and animal waste, with health authorities stating it could even be contracted from domestic cats and dogs.
“It is mainly spread to humans from cattle, sheep and goats, but can also spread from other domestic and wild animals such as kangaroos, camels, rodents, cats, dogs, birds and wallabies,” the health alert states.
Across Victoria, there were 77 Q fever cases in 2024, more than double the 35 cases the previous year, with 26 cases in 2022, 35 in 2021 and 25 in 2020.
Last year marked the highest number of Victorian cases since 88 were recorded in 1994, with five separate outbreaks in 2024, all between August and December.
Those in high risk occupations include abattoir and meat workers, agriculture, livestock and dairy farm workers, pet food manufacturing workers, veterinarians, veterinary nurses/students/researchers, and wildlife/zoo workers and animal trainers.
Family members of workers in high-risk occupations, individuals making visits to at-risk environments such as farms and people living near high-risk industries are also at an increased risk.
""There is an effective vaccine that can protect against Q fever, and the best option for protection if you are in a high-risk category. You must be tested for previous exposure to Q fever before you can receive the vaccine,"" the health advisory said.
""Q fever can be treated with antibiotics. If you receive early treatment, you're likely to recover sooner and have a lower risk of long-term complications.""
Symptoms of Q fever include severe flu-like illness, with those infected also at risk of developing hepatitis or pneumonia.
""While most people with Q fever make a full recovery, occasionally it can cause long-term complications such as heart disease, bone and joint infections and vascular infections,"" the health advisory states.
""These complications are more common for pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems or previous heart problems.
""Approximately 10 to 15 per cent of people with severe infections develop chronic fatigue, also known as Q fever fatigue syndrome, which can last for many years.""
The disease is caused by infection with the Coxiella burnetii bacteria, which is capable of surviving disinfection and staying in the environment for long periods of time.
It is most commonly transmitted to humans through inhalation of dust or aerosols contaminated with bacteria from birth fluids, faeces, urine, or blood of infected animals.
Across Australia, there were 848 Q fever cases in 2024, the highest number since 1993, according to the National Communicable Disease Surveillance Dashboard.",SKY News,lifestyle
Four more Victorian events locked in for pill testing trial as govt reveals more than 700 people had drugs checked at Beyond The Valley,Bryant Hevesi,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/health/four-more-victorian-events-locked-in-for-pill-testing-trial-as-govt-reveals-more-than-700-people-had-drugs-checked-at-beyond-the-valley/news-story/c999d88372b8970ab618ac75a67ab0f3,"Hundreds of young Victorians offered up their drugs for testing at a music festival over the New Year, with the Victorian government now confirming the further events which will have access to pill checking services.
Mental Health Minister Ingrid Stitt on Thursday revealed initial data from a pill testing trial which took place at the Beyond The Valley festival in the rural-based Golden Plains Shire from December 28 to January 1.
The event marked the first occasion festivalgoers in the state were able to have their drugs analysed after the Allan government backed down from its opposition to pill testing and gave the measure the green light to go ahead.
Of those who brought drugs to be looked at by health experts at the festival, which boasted a line-up including Ice Spice, FISHER, Sugababes, Tinlicker and Natasha Bedingfield, more than 15 per cent indicated they were no longer going to consume the substances.
""I can report that more than 700 young Victorians accessed the service during that festival,"" Ms Stitt told reporters.
""For 70 per cent of those people it was the first time they'd ever had a conversation with a health professional about their drug use.
""Forty per cent said that they would consume a smaller amount of drugs as a result of those conversations and one-in-six intended to discard their drugs altogether after visiting the pill testing services.
""So I think that we are very pleased with the early data that we're seeing out of the Beyond The Valley festival. That's why it's so important that we continue with our pill testing trial because it's about giving people, particularly young people, the information they need to make informed choices and to keep them safe.""
Ms Stitt said four further events across metropolitan and regional areas will have pill testing over the next three months.
These include the Pitch Music and Arts Festival from March 7 to 11, the Ultra Music Festival on April 12 and The Warehouse Project on April 25.
The Hardmission Festival on February 8 will also be a pill testing site, after nine people were rushed to hospital following drug overdoses at last year's event.
""Hardmission was an event where we saw a number of young people overdose and end up in the ICU,"" Ms Stitt said.
""That was a combination of the potency of the drugs that they took combined with extreme heat.
""And we want to make sure that we avoid those situations going forward. We thought it was important to be at Hardmission this year.""
Following the overdoses at the Hardmission Festival, Premier Jacinta Allan reiterated the Labor government's long-held view that there was no place for pill testing in Victoria.
However, Ms Allan in June said the government would be introducing pill testing, with the Labor leader coming around to the idea while watching her two children grow older.
The government's pill testing trial will run for 18 months and include 10 mobile sites in total.
Ms Stitt made it clear on Thursday that pill testing will became a permanent fixture in Victoria and that the trial is simply to access the most effective model for the service.
A fixed pill testing location is expected to open in the middle of the year, but the government has only confirmed the facility will be ""co-located in a health service and operate from inner Melbourne, close to nightlife and transport"".
The Victorian Greens on Thursday criticised the government for dragging its feet on its pill testing response.
""Glad to see Labor finally disclosing some of the festivals but why have people had to wait until the final month of summer for this?"" the party's spokesperson for drug harm reduction, Aiv Puglielli, said.
""Pill testing saves lives and people should have the opportunity to forward plan for where they can access the service and make decisions based on that.
""We also need to see progress on the fixed testing site in Melbourne. We were promised mid-2025 and any delay puts lives at risk.""",SKY News,lifestyle

Three of the individuals contracted measles while in Bali and were infectious while out and about at multiple places in Melbourne, Dr Weeramanthri said.
The other two residents acquired their infections within Victoria and are linked to a local outbreak which unfolded last month.
There are now about 20 active exposure sites, including Revolver Upstairs and Somewhere Bar on Chapel Street and ONESIXONE Bar on High Street, all in Prahran.

Other exposure sites include the Frankston Hospital Emergency Department, My Clinic South Yarra, Rosebud Hospital Emergency Department, and Taylors Lakes Hotel.
Grill'd Burgers on Main Street, Mornington, is also listed as an exposure site, along with YOMG Mornington, Hampshire Road Medical Centre in Sunshine, 4Cyte Pathology Sunshine, and The Training Ground in Rosebud.
Further exposure sites include The Royal Melbourne Hospital Emergency Department, DiagnostiCare Specialist Radiology Clinic in Keilor East, the Eastbrooke Family Clinic Lincolnville in Niddrie, and the Bendigo Hospital Emergency Department.
The dates and times specific to each exposure site, as well as how long people who were at the sites during those periods have to monitor for the onset of symptoms for, are currently listed on the Victorian Department of Health website.
There have now been 13 measles cases in Victoria this year, four of them locally acquired.
""Almost all recent cases have arisen in people who have not had two documented doses of the MMR vaccine, showing the highly infectious nature of measles,"" Dr Weeramanthri noted.
""In one instance, transmission occurred in a primary care waiting room, highlighting the importance of immediate isolation of people with fever and rash who present to healthcare settings.""
""A number of populations in Victoria are susceptible to measles, including anyone who is unvaccinated, infants under 12 months of age, immunocompromised people and adults who were born between 1966 and 1992 who may not have received two MMR vaccines in childhood.""
Dr Weeramanthri said that given cases of measles around the world are on the increase ""any overseas travel could also lead to exposure to measles"".
""There are currently outbreaks reported in multiple countries and regions, including Vietnam, Thailand, India, Africa, Europe and the UK, the Middle East, and the USA,"" he said.

Residents looking to travel overseas have been urged to ""make sure they have received appropriate travel vaccinations, including the MMR vaccine"".
Individuals who develop measles symptoms have been told to seek medical care and testing and ensure they ""wear a face mask and call ahead to make sure you can be isolated from others"".
The symptoms - which can develop between seven to 18 days after an individual has been exposed to measles - include ""fever, cough, sore or red eyes (conjunctivitis), runny nose, and feeling generally unwell, followed by a red maculopapular rash"", which usually starts out on the face.

Availability of popular pain relief medication to be limited from February in effort to limit 'intentional overdose' deaths,Sumaiya Chowdhure,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/health/availability-of-popular-pain-relief-medication-to-be-limited-from-february-in-effort-to-limit-intentional-overdose-deaths/news-story/5ebdf55523c90619bc9cbce6d4c0e603,"The availability of paracetamol will be limited from February 1, as the Therapeutic Goods Administration attempts to prevent severe sickness and deaths from ""intentional"" overdoses.
The common painkiller, which is mainly sold under brand names like Panadol, Dymadon and Panamax, is frequently used to treat mild pain and occasionally prescribed to those suffering long-term chronic conditions.
Currently, an unlimited number of paracetamol packs can be purchased in Australia without a prescription, with the medication commonly sold in boxes or bottles of 20, 96 or 100 tablets.
However, the TGA in May 2023 announced that from February 1 this year, the number of tablets per package would now be limited, due to concerns over ""rates of intentional overdose"".
Under the changes, paracetamol packs sold outside pharmacies, such as in supermarkets or at petrol stations, will now be limited to just 16 tablets, down from 20.
Meanwhile, the maximum number of tablets in packages for sale in pharmacies, but without the supervision of a pharmacist, will drop from 100 to 50.
Packages of between 50 and 100 will now only be sold under the supervision of a pharmacist.
In addition, all paracetamol tablets will now be required to be in blister packaging.
Outlining the reason behind the changes, the TGA explained as many as 225 people were hospitalised with liver injury and 50 people die from paracetamol overdose in Australia each year.
In a statement, the body said ""rates of intentional overdose"" were highest amongst adolescents and young adults.
""The decision was informed by an independent expert report that examined the incidence of serious injury and death from intentional paracetamol overdose; advice received from the Advisory Committee on Medicines Scheduling (ACMS); and submissions from two rounds of consultation from individuals, and organisations representing consumers, healthcare practitioners and industry,"" the TGA said.
While normally safe to consume in the correct dosage, ingesting too much paracetamol can be fatal as the build up of the drug causes severe liver toxicity.
Commenting on the new TGA rules, Peter Guthrey MPS, PSA Senior Pharmacist of Strategic Policy, said: ""While pharmacists know paracetamol is very safe when taken at recommended doses, we also know the devastating impact of intentional or unintentional overdose.
""On Friday, PSA will be releasing the next edition of our flagship medicine safety report series which contains concerning data on the use of medicines, including paracetamol, in children and adolescents.
""The data on intentional overdose involving paracetamol is alarming… scheduling changes are not the full solution, but are a strategy which could make a positive difference if it changes the patterns of paracetamol supply.""

The flight arrived at Melbourne International Airport on December 18, making Terminal 2 an exposure site on December 28 between the hours of 9.42am and 11.10am.
The confirmed measles case also attended a Chemist Warehouse on William Thwaites Boulevard in Cranbourne North on December 28 between 11.30am and 12.40pm.
Anyone who visited the sites during the specific times should monitor symptoms until January 14 or 15, as signs of measles can take between seven to 18 days to develop after exposure.
Other current exposure sites include The Links Shopping Centre, mainly Woolworths, at Oakleigh South on December 19 from 11.27am to 12.45pm, and the Friendly Grocer store at 75 Macie road in Bentleigh East on the same day between 12.15pm and 12.50pm.
Pastry Supreme Bakehouse, located at 83 Mackie Road in Bentleigh East, is also listed as an exposure site between 12.20pm and 12.55pm.
Victoria's Department of Health confirmed the latest measles case is in addition to three others which have been linked to recent travel to South-East Asia.
""There has been an increase in notified cases of measles in returned travellers across Australia in recent weeks,"" an alert read on the department's website on Saturday.
""Growing outbreaks have been reported internationally including in Vietnam and Thailand.""
Measles symptoms generally include a fever, sore eyes and cough, usually followed about four days later by a blotchy red rash that spreads down the body.
Dr Wong said initial symptoms may be similar to COVID-19 and the flu, but if a person tests negative to those and develops a rash, they should seek to be tested for measles.
Health authorities urge anyone who develops symptoms to get medical assistance, wear a mask, and call ahead when visiting a healthcare centre to avoid spreading the illness to others.
The measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine is free for people born during or after 1966 without documentation of having received two doses of measles-containing vaccine.
""Anyone planning overseas travel should make sure they have received appropriate travel vaccinations, including MMR vaccine,"" the Department of Health said.
""This is especially important for anyone planning on travelling to South-East Asia.""",SKY News,lifestyle
‘Fly high’: Tributes flow for rugby union player Will Thurston who tragically died while on holiday in Bali,Preston Potts,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/health/fly-high-tributes-flow-for-rugby-union-player-will-thurston-who-tragically-died-while-on-holiday-in-bali/news-story/5073814da23143f53f495668551bcf78,"A young Central Coast rugby union player who died in Bali has been remembered by family and friends following his tragic loss.
Will Thurston, 27, died on Sunday, February 16 after suffering what is understood to have been septic shock while recovering in a Bali hospital from a pancreatic abscess.
A family member confirmed his death on Facebook and said he died in the “place he loved most”.
“Our beloved Will fought a courageous fight until the very end but sadly his body could not pull through. He took his last breath at 2.04am in the place he loved most, Bali,” Ashlee Maree said.
She said the ""journey is not over yet"" for Will with the family raising funds on GoFundMe to get him back on Australian soil and give him the “send off he deserves”.
The fundraiser was set up by Brodie Green to assist the family when Will was in ICU in the Indonesian hospital.
As of Tuesday afternoon, 881 donations had been received with funds sitting at $95,300.
A couple of hours prior to his tragic death, his family confirmed that he had deteriorated over the course of 24 hours.
“We learnt that his pancreas ruptured before surgery which has in turn effect his other organs. Doctors attempted dialysis today which was unsuccessful,"" Ms Maree said.
“Will’s body is also not responding to the medication which is not a great sign.”
On Tuesday Will's family expressed its deepest gratitude for those who had donated, shared or offered support during the challenging time on GoFundMe.
“The funds raised through this GoFundMe will be used in helping pay the medical expenses associated with Will’s care, repatriation to bring Will’s body home and to help cover the costs of his funeral,” Mr Green said.
“Now, the journey begins for Will to be brought home to Australia, where he will be laid to rest surrounded by his loved ones.”
Will’s rugby club left a heartfelt Facebook post saying he was a hardworking kid, filled with enthusiasm for life, mates and family.
“Anyone that ever got to meet Will, trust me will never forget him he was a champion, 27 forever, your really going to be missed,” The Bay Rugby Club said.
Many tributes came through the comment sections on social media sending their love.
“Rest in peace my brother Will, you’re a brother to me when I first met you at training, fly high my bro,” one said.
“Rip mate. Forever a Rugby man,” a second said.
“Fly high Will Thurston, 27 forever,” a third added.

Ex-Australian of the Year and renowned melanoma researcher Prof Richard Scolyer reveals he has been given months to live after resurgence of brain cancer,Gemma Crotty,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/health/ex-australian-of-the-year-and-renowned-melanoma-researcher-prof-richard-scolyer-reveals-he-has-months-to-live-after-resurgence-of-brain-cancer/news-story/8a6a471d7e4439800aa60faa018e0a02,"Leading melanoma researcher and pathologist Professor Richard Scolyer has revealed he has been given only has months to live after the resurgence of his brain cancer.
Professor Scolyer was diagnosed with glioblastoma in May 2023 and volunteered to undergo a revolutionary treatment for the aggressive and often terminal form of brain cancer.
His prognosis at the time was just six to eight months but thanks to the treatment he defied the odds and went 22 months without a resurgence.
The treatment, based on a decade-long study of melanoma, involved combination immunotherapy before surgery to remove his brain tumour and a vaccine tailored to his tumour’s characteristics.
The 58-year-old has documented his journey on social media and only just in November shared he was still cancer-free.
But in a heart-wrenching update on Monday, the leading pathologist took to Instagram to share that the tumours had returned to his brain and his outlook looked “poor”.
“Unfortunately there is a larger volume of quickly growing brain cancer (glioblastoma, IDH WT, unmethylated etc) in my left brain,” the father of three wrote.
“The prognosis is poor.”
He said while part of the recurrent tumour had been removed the week before, some of it couldn’t be taken out due to its location.
He further wrote the treatment he had may have “made a difference” to his survival but said further clinical trials were needed.
He continued: “Either way, I am proud of the data produced after treatment with neoadjuvant immunotherapy (and recently published in the prestigious journal Nature Medicine) which I hope will make a difference for others.
“I greatly appreciate the support of all my family, friends & colleagues who have been looking after me so well & the incredible research that has been performed,” he said.
“I hope the latter will change the field & patient outcomes in the not too distant future.”
Professor Scolyer told The Sydney Morning Herald his prognosis was ""in months, not years … it’s not unexpected, but it’s still devastating"".
Formerly a director at the Melanoma Institute Australia, the renowned pathologist was the joint Australian of the Year 2024 alongside co-director Georgina Long for their revolutionary work in melanoma.
The pair teamed up to develop the treatment for Professor Scolyer’s cancer and he became the first person to receive the immunotherapy treatment.
In a sobering interview with A Current Affair on Monday, Professor Scolyer revealed the emotional turmoil he was going through upon the discovery of the tumour during surgery last week.
""I'm not ready to go yet. I love my life,” he told host Allison Langdon.
""I guess I feel lucky that I've been able to go for so long without a recurrence of it.""
Professor Scolyer’s diagnosis came after he suffered a seizure in Poland while travelling throughout Europe speaking at medical conferences, and an MRI upon his return to Australia revealed he had a glioblastoma.
While the first couple of months of treatment brought epileptic seizures, liver issues and pneumonia, he later revealed he was feeling “the best I have felt for yonks”.
“It certainly doesn’t mean that my brain cancer is cured… but it’s just nice to know that it hasn’t come back yet, so I’ve still got some more time to enjoy my life with my wife Katie and my three wonderful kids,” he told the BBC at the time.",SKY News,lifestyle

Kaylah Collins, who is married to Sydney Roosters prop Lindsay Collins, took to TikTok to share her weekly haul of fresh veggies and organic meat that sets the family back about $700 per week.
In the caption, Ms Collins said: “A week of groceries for a professional athlete and family”.
She proceeded to go into detail about what’s needed to feed her family of three.
“This is our shop for him, myself, one other adult and our seven-month-old,” she said, filming herself unpacking a trolley.
“Everything we buy is wholefood and organic from Harris Farm - lots of avocados, lots of sweet potato and lots of eggs.
“We then do a shop at our butcher, who does grass fed, grass-finished, organic meat.”
Their items included Iggy’s sourdough bread, tinned salmon, organic yoghurt and organic eggs.
Their fresh produce consisted of things like sweet potatoes, cherry tomatoes, cucumber, avocado, capsicum and celery.
The shop at Harris Farm cost the family $307.39.
Ms Collins said they get their steaks, sausages and mince from The Meat Store in Bondi Junction, which sets them back about $250 for the week.
The cost of her groceries left many commenters aghast.
“A bit excessive, $700 a week,” one said.
“I thought my $500 a fortnight was insane for a family of four,” another added.
“And here we are surviving on $180 a week for groceries. Wish we could do organic etc we try to do what we can! A third said with Ms Collins responding back to the comment.
“We do sacrifice a lot to be able to eat this way as it is very expensive. However, we are lucky to be able to be in this position,” she said.
The Collins' spends roughly $2,800 a month, which is roughly four times more than the average Australian household grocery bill.
According to a July 2024 survey from Canstar Blue, Aussie families spend on average $168 per week on groceries, equating to $728 a month.
Ms Collins’ husband Lindsay is signed on with the NRL's Sydney Roosters, and reportedly earns $675,000 a year.",SKY News,lifestyle
Cruise ship lawyer warns of ‘absolutely horrifying’ inspection report on Royal Caribbean: ‘Disney would never’,Unknown,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/health/cruise-ship-lawyer-warns-of-absolutely-horrifying-inspection-report-on-royal-caribbean-disney-would-never/news-story/869da1621ea1607273f2d7fbfd6da81a,"A sinking ship.
A lawyer who says he “sues cruise lines for a living” called out Royal Caribbean following the “absolutely horrifying” results of an inspection done by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC).
Spencer Aronfeld, known on TikTok as @cruiseshiplawyer, made a video last week where he described what went wrong when the CDC inspected a Royal Caribbean Symphony of the Seas ship.
Aronfeld said one of the biggest issues was that raw eggs and raw hamburgers weren't being stored at the correct refrigeration temperature on the boat.
Furthermore, crew members at Johnny Rockets allegedly had open wounds and were touching ice with their bare hands.
In addition, “several children came down with severe GI problems while in their daycare centers, and the daycare center failed to follow the protocols for referring them to the medical center and for reporting these things as acte gastrointestinal illnesses, projectile diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal cramps to the CDC,” said Aronfeld.
That misstep by the cruise line, according to Aronfeld, allowed “these poor kids to spread a potential norovirus to their parents and other passengers on the ship.”
Aronfeld revealed that the CDC scored the ship an 86 in the inspection report — which he claimed was “barely satisfactory.”
“One point less, which is an 85, would have been an unsatisfactory evaluation, which probably would have caused them to have to cancel the cruise,” the legal expert shared. “Quite frankly, I think they should have.”
Aronfeld also said it will cost Royal Caribbean around $65,000 to correct these issues in the allowed short timespan.
In a follow-up video, Aronfeld said that as of Friday, Feb. 21, Royal Caribbean has not issued a corrective report which they have to do to fix the problems outlined by the CDC.
“Which lends me to believe they haven’t fixed it,” said Aronfeld. “Which means that these problems are still existing.”
“The ship is sailing, and it’s got passengers on board right now, but I sure hope that Royal Caribbean has done at least enough to correct these issues, but they should have at least reported it to the CDC,” he added.
Aronfeld’s followers responded to his videos exposing Royal Caribbean in the comments.
“Disney Cruise Line would NEVER,” one person wrote.
“Did he say Symphony of Disease,” another person joked.
A third TikToker said, “Cruises are disgusting….? Is this surprising?”
“I’m disappointed in RC, I expected more from this cruise line,” another comment read, to which Aronfeld responded, “Me too!”
Someone else called on the CDC to “inspect every single ship docked in the US nonstop.”

"Jet passengers should sit in the rear seats on an aeroplane to survive a crash, experts say",Unknown,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/health/jet-passengers-should-sit-in-the-rear-seats-on-an-aeroplane-to-survive-a-crash-experts-say/news-story/14017c54efdd1b0ecee83d790a7463d3,"Those sitting in the rear seats of an airplane might have a greater chance of surviving a plane crash, according to experts.
However, no single “magic safest seat” actually exists, an engineering professional asserted.
When assessing the probability of surviving a plane crash, investigators look at five things: aircraft integrity, safety restraint effectiveness, gravitational forces(or G-forces) experienced by passengers and crew, the environment inside the aircraft, and post-crash factors, such as fire or smoke, reported the Wall Street Journal.
A crash is considered “survivable” by the National Transportation Safety Board if the forces transmitted to passengers don’t exceed the limits of human tolerance and if the structure of the aircraft remains largely intact. A crash is nonsurvivable when G-forces are so great that the body can’t withstand it.
When Jeju Air Flight 2216 crash-landed at Muan International Airport in South Korea in December, the plane burst into a massive fireball, killing all but two of the 181 passengers.
The survivors were two flight attendants, a 33-year-old man and a 25-year-old woman — who were sitting in the very back of the plane, which was the only recognizable part of the aircraft left intact.
A few days before the Jeju Air Flight crash, an Azerbaijan Airlines flight crashed in Kazakhstan Wednesday, killing at least 38 of the 67 people on board.
All survivors were seated in the rear of the plane.
However, many factors come into play.
“There are a lot of reasons someone may survive in what appears to be a totally unsurvivable situation,” Barbara Dunn, president of the International Society of Air Safety Investigators, told the Journal.
“Depending on how the aircraft lands and where a passenger is seated has an impact. If you have your seat belt tightened, it limits the amount of flailing the body goes through. It also depends on whether a passenger is able to assume a brace position.”
If a plane crashes nose-first, passengers up front will get the most impact — but sitting in the back of the plane isn’t the only factor that determines whether one will survive a plane crash.
“A lot of people think it’s safer in the back than in the front,” Dunn said. “Not necessarily. How quick the fire takes over and how quick you can get to an exit, all those things matter as well.”
“When you hear survivable, you’d think people survived, and when you hear non-survivable, you’d think everybody dies,” Anthony T. Brickhouse, an expert in aerospace safety and a professor at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, told WSJ.
“We’ve had people survive what we would call nonsurvivable crashes, and we’ve also had people die in what we would call survivable crashes.”
According to data collected by the Flight Safety Foundation, an international nonprofit that provides safety guidance, there have been only 17 other crashes in the past eight decades where a plane carrying 80 or more passengers had one or two survivors.
In January 2024, Japan Airlines evacuated hundreds of passengers before the frame of the aircraft collapsed in flames after a collision with another jet upon landing.
TRT World reported that 2024 saw a grim increase in fatal aircraft accidents for the global aviation industry — compared to 2023 which was considered the “safest year ever in aviation” with zero recorded fatalities in major passenger plane crashes.
The good news is that “the vast majority of aircraft accidents are survivable, and the majority of people in accidents survive,” Ed Galea, professor of fire safety engineering who has conducted landmark studies on plane crash evacuations, recently told CNN.
But “there is no magic safest seat,” he added.
“It depends on the nature of the accident you’re in. Sometimes it’s better at the front, sometimes at the back.”

Set to co-host the festive musical event alongside David Campbell, Abo was absent from the festivities on Tuesday evening and instead watched it from her hospital bed.
In a social media post, Abo said hospital was not where she thought she be, but her “appendix had other ideas”.
“Unfortunately surgery has kept me from being at the Sidney Myer Music Bowl sharing this magical evening with you all,” she wrote to her almost 50k followers.
“Doctor’s orders!!
“Thankfully all is good and I’ve been very well cared for by an incredible team of doctors and nurses.”
Abo said she would watch Carols By Candlelight from her bed, calling the special evening a “beautiful cause” which helped support the work of Vision Australia.
Campbell told the crowd of 10,000 people his host had been struck down by appendicitis and had been told to stay home to rest.
“Apparently hosting a three hour national TV show is not taking it easy,” he said.
“I have seen her (Sarah) host the Today show in her sleep but this – too much.
“I just want to say Sarah, get better. I miss you pal, right here.”
Campbell then rallied the thousands of people in the audience to wish his bedridden co-star a Merry Christmas.
“We miss you a lot,” he said.
On social media, Abo reacted to the shout out with a heart emoji.
It is the 87th year Carols By Candlelight has taken place, with artists such as Tim Campbell, Casey Donovan and Denis Walter, among many others, performing a list of much-loved Christmas songs.",SKY News,lifestyle
Cosmetic patients potentially put at risk of blood-borne viruses in Sydney clinic after alleged discovery of unregistered staff,Sumaiya Chowdhure,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/health/cosmetic-patients-potentially-put-at-risk-of-bloodborne-viruses-in-sydney-clinic-after-alleged-discovery-of-unregistered-staff/news-story/f8207e0bc47fbfe7de5bdd5a43480646,"A major investigation has revealed a beauty clinic operating in Sydney's CBD has potentially exposed patients to blood-borne viruses included HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C.
The NSW Health Care Complaints Commission issued an urgent warning against receiving further treatment at Ketthip Beauty Clinic (the Clinic) and urged those who received infusions or underwent any invasive procedures to get tested.
The health organisation watchdog reportedly executed a search warrant on the clinic last month after a number of complaints were made.
Evidence obtained during the investigation ""indicated"" a number of malpractices including non-registered staff pretending to be registered medical practitioners while performing invasive cosmetic procedures such as breast augmentation.
In a statement the Commission said it had located and seized large quantities of surgical equipment including scalpels, sutures, cannulas and other medical devices which were mostly marked as being for veterinary use only.
Large amounts of medication used by the clinic have also been allegedly imported from overseas and were expired.
""The hygiene and infection control practices of the Clinic are highly concerning and pose an immediate risk to the health and safety of the public,"" the Commission said.
""Clients of the Clinic who had infusions, injections or underwent any invasive procedure (such as microdermabrasion or PDO thread lift) should see their GP and ask to be tested for blood borne viruses.""
The clinic was hit with an Interim Probation Order on Monday following the investigations to prevent it from providing health services of any kind for a period of eight weeks.
Investigations are continuing.
The warning comes just a month after the Commission exposed another non-registered health practitioner providing patients with invasive cosmetic treatments in Sydney's south-west.
Ms Norsafiza Binti Zakaria, who operates under several aliases, including Natasha Scha, Zakaria Scha, and Scha Zakaria Beauty Spa was allegedly illegally administering Botox and other injectable substances without medical supervision.
The treatments resulted in the hospitalisation of three women with suspected cases of botulism linked to unregulated home anti-wrinkle injections.
Botulism is a serious poisoning caused by toxins that attack the body's nerves.
NSW Health took the opportunity to remind the public of the dangers of unregulated cosmetic injectables.
NSW Health Executive Director Health Protection Dr Jeremy McAnulty urged people to receive cosmetic injections from authorised practitioners.
“Cosmetic injections, if used incorrectly, could result in serious harm and even death in the most serious of cases,” he said.
“Botulism, although rare, can be fatal, which is why it is so important that anyone receiving cosmetic injections does so under the supervision of an appropriately registered health practitioner.""
The Commission imposed an Interim Prohibition Order on Ms Zakaria, banning her from providing any health services for an initial period of eight weeks while investigations continued.",SKY News,lifestyle
Australian authorities urged to stay 'alert' after mystery disease causing significant 'alarm' kills more than 50 people in DRC,Patrick Staveley,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/health/australian-authorities-urged-to-stay-alert-after-mystery-disease-causing-significant-alarm-kills-more-than-50-people-in-drc/news-story/17588412886fe3c22d894eec94e1bb67,"The World Health Organisation has expressed concern over the spread of a dangerous disease in the Democratic Republic of Congo, that has killed more than 50 people.
The illness, which is currently unknown, has been spreading since mid-January and has been said to have started after three children ate a bat.
More than 400 cases have been recorded with at least 53 deaths - most of which have occurred about 48 hours after the onset of symptoms.
WHO spokesperson Tarik Jasarevic said the illness posed a ""significant public health threat"".
Symptoms include fever, vomiting and internal bleeding.
Majority of the cases were reported from Bomate village, while others were recorded in Boloko and the Dondo village.
Ebola, a disease which led to previous outbreaks in Africa, was ruled out as the cause.
Infectious diseases expert and Deakin Distinguished Professor and Chair in Epidemiology at Deakin University, Catherine Bennett, said the fact that the outbreak began with bats, the rapid decline of those who have the illness and the death rate were particular aspects that ""cause alarm"".
She said health authorities would be watching ""globally"" although the situation is not at panic stations yet.
""It's very much about this constant vigilance. It's absolutely on the radar. Everyone's got to be watching what's happening with this,"" Professor Bennett told SkyNews.com.au.
""It's not about panicking, the risk to the rest of the world remains low. At the moment it looks like they've got a clear understanding of where the outbreak is.""
Professor Bennett warned though that all it took was for one asymptomatic person to hop on a plane for the infection to spread.
""You can be in another country in hours and that might be someone who's unfortunately caught something - not symptomatic yet - on a plane and that's what we're worried about in terms of spread,"" she said.
She suggested the mystery illness could be linked to malaria after some people who were tested following their deaths returned positive samples for the disease.
""Malaria is quite high in the region. They had an outbreak there last year where they were looking at a form of respiratory illness in people who had malaria. Malaria can be a complication, and people might not even have diagnosed malaria. But it can impact how you cope with other illnesses,"" she said.
The professor said the high death rate of the disease - which is about 12.3 per cent - could make it harder for it to spread.
""Ebola itself used to be such a terrible disease, in that people who got it often died. It actually also meant it was quite containable, because there weren't people who were otherwise well walking around, carrying it and passing it on to other people,"" she said.
""So sometimes, the virus being really severe and causing quick deaths actually limits how much it spreads. So that's sort of an irony almost. The worse it is, the (more) it can be controlled, because you can see it more clearly. People are so unwell they don't seem to spread it.""",SKY News,lifestyle
Residents in Western Australia warned about deadly amoebic meningitis amid heatwave conditions in the state,Bryant Hevesi,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/health/residents-in-western-australia-warned-about-deadly-amoebic-meningitis-amid-heatwave-conditions-in-the-state/news-story/95cf573c1b4a53508f7844f33f7bdee9,"Residents in Western Australia have been warned about a rare infection which can result in death as a heatwave engulfs large swathes of the state.
The state's health department this week issued an alert over amoebic meningitis, with residents urged to be cautious around water that is untreated or poorly treated.
The infection, caused by Naegleria fowleri, ""can cause inflammation and destruction of brain tissue"" if forced into the nose through warm freshwater.
The single-celled organism could be found in rivers, lakes and farm dams, as well as swimming pools, spas and backyard garden hoses when temperatures rise above 28 degrees.
""People should assume that any water in hot weather could contain amoeba and take precautions by not allowing water to be forced up the nose,"" WA Health's Executive Director Environmental Health, Dr Michael Lindsay, said.
""At particular risk are people in rural areas who have their own tank, dam or bore water supply, including those living on farms and people with poorly maintained swimming pools.
""It can affect people of any age however children and young people are usually more susceptible due to their increased use of swimming pools and engaging in activities that could force water up the nose.""
Shallow wading pools which have been exposed to the sun for an extended period of time are also a concern.
Dr Lindsay noted the ""amoeba that causes the illness does not survive in water that is well chlorinated, clean of dirt and debris"".
""Fortunately, there has not been a case of amoebic meningitis in Western Australia since the 1980s, however, it's important to remain vigilant as there is always a risk of infection,"" he said.
Tips to avoid infection include ""run sprinklers and hoses until cool water flows, before playing in water; don't squirt water up noses; prevent water going up your nose – walk or lower yourself into water, don't dive or jump; swim in the ocean or chlorinated pools, rather than fresh water, and closely monitor and check that pool and spa chlorine levels are in a safe range"".
Other tips include ""disinfect swimming pool and spa water with chlorine regularly, clean wading pools and dry them in the sun after each use, flush out pipes before showering and bathing, don't use tap water to rinse out nasal passages, use sterile, distilled water or saline, don't swim in dirty water including dams, rivers, or lakes, don't dig or stir up sediment in fresh water sources, and avoid putting your head under water when swimming in fresh water sources"".
The health alert comes amid a heatwave warning being put in place across parts of Western Australia until Thursday.
There is an extreme heatwave warning for the Lower West and Central Wheat Belt Districts and a severe heatwave warning for the Gascoyne, Goldfields, North Interior, South Interior, Central West, South West, South East Coastal, and Great Southern Districts.",SKY News,lifestyle

The state's department of health on Friday said that 87 cryptosporidiosis cases have been reported since January 1.
That number is higher than the five-year average and comes after Victorian cases hit a record 2,349 in 2024 following a 233 per cent year-on-year increase.
The infection can cause stomach cramps and watery diarrhoea for a number of weeks, with outbreaks often linked to public swimming pools.
Individuals with a weakened immune system also face a prolonged bout of illness.
Victorian Chief Health Officer Tarun Weeramanthri said that while most germs in public pools are killed by chlorine, the cryptosporidium parasite is highly resistant to the level of chlorine normally used in the facilities.
Swimmers who have had diarrhoea have been warned to stay out of public pools for at least two weeks.
""It's important to remember that you remain infectious for several weeks after your diarrhoea stops,"" Dr Weeramanthri said.
""So don't swim until two weeks after your symptoms have stopped.""

Swimmers have also been told to shower using soap before heading to a public pool, and avoid swallowing pool water.
""It's the simple steps that are most effective - showering with soap before swimming will help keep germs out of the water,"" Dr Weeramanthri said.
""And of course, avoid swallowing the pool water if you can. If you think you or your child may have cryptosporidiosis, contact your doctor. The doctor will assist you for testing.""

JEV - related to Murray Valley encephalitis and Kunjun virus - was only detected in Australia in recent years, with Queensland's last human case recorded in May 2022.
Bush mosquitoes are said to spread the virus, which leads to brain swelling, with symptoms including disorientation, high ever and sudden headache.
The resident with dengue virus - the first such locally acquired case in Townsville in five years - is receiving out-of-hospital care.
Dr Donohue said the chances of further community cases were low.
""Since the Eliminate Dengue project started almost 15 years ago, which released mosquitos carrying dengue-resistant Wolbachia bacteria into the community, the disease has been almost non-existent,"" he said.
""Both cases are breakthrough cases and are not outbreaks. The cases are not linked.""
Residents are still being reminded to take steps to protect themselves from mosquito bites.
""Mosquitoes breed in small quantities of water which can be found in items like tyres, buckets, toys, or pot plant bases,"" Dr Donohue said.
""Tip out the water and limit the chances of them breeding in your own backyard. When you are outside or in the bush, wear long, loose, light-coloured clothing and cover your feet.
""Also use insect repellent with DEET or picaridin as well as electric zappers or mosquito coils.
""The mosquitoes that could transmit dengue fever are stealthy. They bite people during the day and are most likely found indoors with some people often not knowing they have been bitten.""
Dr Donohue said while the community risk is low, ""anyone with a sudden fever, intense headache, muscle and joint pain, extreme tiredness or a rash should contact their GP"".",SKY News,lifestyle
Victorian health authorities issue alert over poliovirus after detection in wastewater sampling at Western Treatment Plant,Bryant Hevesi,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/health/victorian-health-authorities-issue-alert-over-poliovirus-after-detection-in-wastewater-sampling-at-western-treatment-plant/news-story/a49e9d3742b42981e63834b6d7d1a0a4,"Health authorities in Victoria have issued an alert over poliovirus following routine sampling of wastewater in Melbourne's south-west.
In a statement on Tuesday, the state's Department of Health said vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 had been detected at the Western Treatment Plant in Werribee.
The discovery was made in pre-treated sewage on December 2 as part of the nation's poliovirus surveillance program.
""This detection is likely linked to someone who received a live polio vaccine overseas and has continued to shed the virus since arriving in Victoria,"" the statement said.
""An inactivated polio vaccine is used in Australia, which means it cannot multiply in a person, is not found in the bowel or sewage and cannot cause polio disease.""
Sewage sampling will be increased over the coming months so the situation can be monitored.
The Western Treatment Plant is a sprawling facility next to Port Phillip Bay, with about half of Melbourne's sewage sent there.
The department said the risk of disease transmission in the state ""is considered very low"".
This is ""due to Victoria's high vaccination coverage and effective sewage treatment processes and the particular characteristics of the virus detected which have been analysed in detail by the regional poliovirus reference laboratory located within the Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory"".
The find follows vaccine-derived poliovirus being detected in wastewater in other parts of the world this year, including in Europe.
The department said the detection served as a reminder to residents to ensure they are up-to-date with their immunisations as that is the best defence against polio, a highly contagious viral infection which can result in paralysis and death.
""In countries where polio has been eradicated, the importation of the virus through unvaccinated or inadequately vaccinated individuals remains a concern,"" it said.
Weâ€™ve been notified of a detection of vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 in wastewater sampling in the Melbourne metropolitan area. The presence of virus in wastewater poses no risk to Melbourne residents, as the sewage is thoroughly treated.More: https://t.co/PDnWop30IG 1/2ðŸ§µ pic.twitter.com/TANq4LPrjd
""Immunisation is the best protection against polio. This detection is a reminder to keep up to date with your polio immunisations.
""Polio immunisation coverage in Victoria is extremely high with 95 per cent of children at five years of age protected – above the national average.
""However, childhood immunisation coverage has declined since 2021 and some populations in Victoria have lower coverage.""
The department said that despite the detection, the nation ""remains polio-free, as this is not a wild-type poliovirus detection"".",SKY News,lifestyle
NSW Health issues alert after woman rushed to ICU following possible toxicity from anti-wrinkle treatment in Sydney home,Sumaiya Chowdhure,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/health/nsw-health-issues-alert-after-woman-rushed-to-icu-following-possible-toxicity-from-antiwrinkle-treatment-in-sydney-home/news-story/051d3d5b6d12cc8bbabd549f607d51fe,"New South Wales Health has issued a public alert after a woman was rushed to the ICU where she is fighting for her life after receiving unauthorised cosmetic anti-wrinkle injections.
The woman is suspected to be suffering from a case of botulism which is believed to be linked to an unregulated anti-wrinkle treatment she received at a Sydney home from a person in the previous two weeks.
Botulism is a serious poisoning caused by toxins that attack the body's nerves.
She is currently receiving intensive care at a hospital in Sydney.
NSW Health is working with the Health Care Complaints Commission and NSW Police on this matter to investigate further.
NSW Health has taken this opportunity to remind the public of the dangers of unregulated cosmetic injectables.
NSW Health Executive Director Health Protection Dr Jeremy McAnulty urged people to receive cosmetic injections from authorised practitioners.
“Cosmetic injections, if used incorrectly, could result in serious harm and even death in the most serious of cases,” Dr McAnulty said.
“Botulism, although rare, can be fatal, which is why it is so important that anyone receiving cosmetic injections does so under the supervision of an appropriately registered health practitioner.
“In this particular case, investigations are continuing, but we want people to be aware of the symptoms of botulism as others could have been exposed.”
Symptoms of botulism may include progressive weakness, difficulty swallowing, drooping eyelids, blurred or double vision and difficulty breathing.
The symptoms can appear for up to two weeks following injections.",SKY News,lifestyle
Health Minister Mark Butler under fire as he signs off on average 3.73 per cent rise on private health insurance after negotiations,David Wu,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/health/health-minister-mark-butler-under-fire-as-he-signs-off-on-average-373-per-cent-rise-on-private-health-insurance-after-negotiations/news-story/f1055b94ca3aece523cfa4f15f71becd,"The opposition has blasted the Albanese government for approving a price hike on private health insurance that will impact close to 15 million Australians.
Health Minister Mark Butler on Wednesday night confirmed premiums will increase an industry average of 3.73 per cent, describing it a ""justified and proportionate"" rise.
Mr Butler had spent months negotiating with insurers and asked them to resubmit their claims of a ""reasonable"" premium rise, noting the ongoing cost of living crisis that continues to impact households and leading into a federal election being called.
“Based on the resubmissions, I was not prepared to tick and flick their (insurers') asks and instead asked them to resubmit again. We’ve now ensured a better deal for the 15 million Australians with private health insurance,"" he said in a statement.
The opposition has labelled it the highest premium increase in seven years.
Asked what more the government could do, given the cost of healthcare was also impacting insurers, shadow home affairs minister James Paterson told Sky News Australia Mr Butler ""should have been more up front and honest about it earlier"".
""He’s been hiding this decision for months. It was due a long time ago. And really, on the eve of an election he’s finally tried to sneak it out amid a bad news day for the government on national security,"" he said to First Edition host Peter Stefanovic.
""Australian families were already struggling to hold onto their private health insurance with all the other cost of living pressures they have faced on this government’s watch.
""And the Albanese government has just made a decision to make it even worst.
""This is a seriously out of touch government.""
The 3.73 per cent rise, which comes into effect April 1, is above household inflation.
Health insurance premiums last year rose an average 3.03 per cent.
Some insurers had reportedly asked for a six per cent increase, citing higher costs of operation, with NIB announcing an average rise of 5.79 per cent.
Mr Butler in his statement also took aim at Peter Dutton, saying he had approved a 6.2 per cent rise on private health premiums when he was health minister in 2014.
Energy Minister Chris Bowen jumped to the defence of his Labor colleague on Thursday, saying Mr Butler ""worked very hard at getting this down as low as possible"".
""He worked it through, got the increase as low as possible because we believe that cost of living and health is a key issue for the Australian people. That's why we've made the big investment in Medicare,"" he said on Nine's Today show.
Sophie Ryan, an iSelect comparison expert, said the average of 3.73 per cent did not sound like much, but ""every single dollar adds up"" in these tough times.
She encouraged Aussie with private health insurance to reach out to their insurer to find out the exact increase on their premiums as some will be more and others less.
""Now is the time to check on that and see if you can switch before April 1,"" she said.
Ms Ryan also flagged a recent survey of 1,000 people found that almost one third - or 28 per cent - to cancel, downgrade premiums and shop around if a price hike occurred.
""You can't put a price on your health. We know that Aussies do really value having private health insurance, essentially that peace of mind knowing that if an unfortunate incident were to occur you would have private cover,"" she said.
Ms Ryan urged people to switch before they decide to ditch private health insurance.",SKY News,lifestyle

An arresting smile: Georgia sorority girl Lily Stewart’s ‘hot mugshot’ charms internet: ‘She’s innocent’,Unknown,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/trending/an-arresting-smile-georgia-sorority-girl-lily-stewarts-hot-mugshot-charms-internet-shes-innocent/news-story/d0e256b2e67e35daed1b41344d47b5d2,"She’s guilty of stealing their hearts!
The internet is swooning over a Georgia sorority girl whose “hot mugshot” went viral after her arrest for speeding — with fans offering to pay her bail and one gushing: “They done locked up Miss America!”
“Whatever she did my heart says she’s innocent,” one Facebook user wrote under a post of Alpha Chi sorority member Lily Stewart’s mugshot.
“How much is her bail? I’ll pay it,” another quipped on X — while a third wondered, “Is her phone number in the [police] report?”
Stewart, a student at the University of Georgia in Athens, was busted March 8 for speeding over the “maximum limits” and faces a fine of up to $1,000, according to a post by The Georgia Gazette, shared by GAFollowers.
The college student’s flawless mugshot — which features her with a bright smile, spotless makeup and not a hair out of place — drew both praise and jokes about her Little-Miss-Perfect appearance.
“Must have been a sale at lululemon,” one social media user quipped.
“Your honor, she was just trying to get to brunch for bottomless mimosas,” another teased.
Others mock-pleaded her innocence, proclaiming, “Your honor she was on the way to rescue my cat from a burning tree.”
And some simply cheered her ability to take a great photo — even while in police custody.
“This is the way to take a mugshot. Go girl!” one person wrote. Another added: “She ate this mugshot up [not gonna lie].”
Stewart, for her part, appeared to acknowledge the bonkers nature of the situation by sharing some of the best jokes made about her arrest, writing on TikTok, “some of my favorite/unhinged comments on my mugshot.”
The comment section of her TikTok page also gave a nod to the absurdity of glamorizing a run-in with the law — with some joking she was speeding “too fast for the haters” and another quipping, “She was taking the fast lane to my heart.”
Stewart was arrested by the Georgia State Patrol, the Morgan County Sheriff’s Office told The Post.

Meghan Markle sends handwritten comeback to podcaster who said she was ‘scared’ for her: ‘Absolutely flabbergasted’,Unknown,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/meghan-markle-sends-handwritten-comeback-to-podcaster-who-said-she-was-scared-for-her-absolutely-flabbergasted/news-story/433895643d8900e1a7f4df785469909e,"Meghan Markle is showing off her sense of humour.
Two weeks after the debut of “With Love, Meghan” on March 4, the 43-year-old Duchess sent a handwritten note to “Not Skinny But Not Fat” podcaster Amanda Hirsch after the host commented that the series’ trailer left her feeling “scared”.
Hirsch, 33, shared a photo of the note from Meghan Wednesday on Instagram.
The influencer included a screenshot of her comment on Meghan’s January 2 Instagram post of the trailer for “With Love, Meghan.”
Hirsch wrote, “You guys I’m scared for Meghan.”
In her note, Meghan sought to allay the podcaster’s fears.
“Dear Amanda, I heard you were feeling scared,” the former “Suits” star began. “Don’t be! This is the fun part — let’s enjoy it,” she added.
Markle signed the note, “As ever, Meghan.”
Markle’s new lifestyle brand, which has received backing from “With Love, Meghan” distributor Netflix, is named “As Ever.”
The missive was penned in the Duchess’s characteristically sharp penmanship — she freelanced as a calligrapher during her days as a struggling actress — on stationery personalized with her monogram, a cursive “M” capped with a crown.
A too-stunned-to-spell-correctly Hirsch captioned the post, “OH MY DUTCHESS.”
In her Instagram Stories, Hirsch expanded upon her reaction to receiving the note.
“You guys. I just got a letter. And I was like, what is this? What is this? What is this?” she said giddily in a clip, waving the note’s envelope, also emblazoned with Markle’s cipher. Sarcastically, Hirsch added that she “started thinking what it could be. Any guesses?”
Hirsch also explained the meaning of her initial comment, writing, “Remember I said I was scared for Meghan’s new show and the possible hate she would get bc for some reason ppl wanna hate on her about everything?”
Of her excitement at receiving the note, Hirsch declared, “Meghan now has a new fan for life.”
“Like, obviously framing this,” she continued. “Beyond shook. Beyond spiraling. Did I smell the paper? Yes! Do I want my own monogram? Yes. Am I absolutely flabbergasted and obsessed. F—K. YES.”
In another Instagram Story post, Hirsch wrote, “I feel like Dave [Portnoy] when he posted Taylor [Swift]’s note,” referring to Taylor Swift superfan and Barstool Sports founder Portnoy.
“Keep it to ourselves? Couldn’t be us,” she added.
Netflix has already renewed “With Love, Meghan” for a Season 2 and wrapped production.
The Post revealed that filming for the second season had begun by January.
The eight-episode first season features some of Meghan’s famous friends, including Mindy Kaling and her former “Suits” co-star Abigail Spencer.

Two fire trucks and eight firefighters rushed to the scene at about 8.45am after the blaze broke out on the corners of Terralong and Collins streets.
Thirty three children and the driver were safely rescued from the flame-engulfed coach, which was completely gutted.
The council had advised locals to avoid the area as the firefighters battled the blaze, which took about 15 minutes.
Kiama Municipal Council appointed Avcon, a waste management service, to ensure the storm water runoff after the incident was managed safely to minimise pollution to Black Beach.
HAZMAT crews arrived on the scene to manage the diesel spill from the bus, which was carrying 200 litres at the time it caught fire.
FRNSW said at this stage the fuel tanks remained intact, and an assessment of the local drains revealed no contamination following the fire.
""Heavy tow services were arranged to remove the vehicle from the area, and alternative transport was organised for the children,"" FRNSW said in a statement.
Superintendent Adam Dewberry said the cause of the fire was being investigated.
""It's still smouldering so we'll let it cool down more before moving into investigation and recovery,"" he said.
""The information we get from the driver will be important as well as the observations of what our responding firefighters saw to get an idea of how it did start.
""The kids are safe, some would’ve been a bit excited and a bit put out but we’ll look after them as best as possible.""

'How do you not have breakdowns?': Australians shocked by how much annual leave workers in United States entitled to,Sumaiya Chowdhure,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/trending/how-do-you-not-have-breakdowns-australians-shocked-by-how-much-annual-leave-workers-in-united-states-entitled-to/news-story/d67c9b0e1351101d65fd8949d075840e,"Americans have given an insight into their annual leave entitlements from work which has left thousands around the world including Australians feeling shocked by the grim working conditions in the US.
A TikTok video by Beyond_Strategy interviewing Americans on the street has gone viral after some revealed annual leave entitlements of as little as six days a year.
In America, workers are not legally entitled to any paid holidays at all, however most US employers offer paid vacation time of up to ten days each year. In addition, US workers must be working in their job for 12 months before they can access the annual leave which is accrued over time.
Comparatively, in Australia all employees except for those who work as a casual are entitled to paid annual leave under the National Employment Standards (NES).
Full-time and part-time employees in Australia get four weeks of annual leave based on their ordinary hours of work, however shift workers may receive up to five weeks.
New Zealand requires 4 weeks paid leave. The U.S. requires 0 paid leave. It has been interesting asking Americans about work culture this past week with Beyond.

Create proper work life balance for your employees. #annualleave #holidayleave #american #americaninnewzealand #americanworkculture #cultureshock #nztiktok #streetinterview
The first American worker interviewed by Beyond_Strategy revealed they received 12 days of annual leave a year.
Next up, a man revealed a jaw dropping annual leave allowance of just six days a year but the entitlement did not seem to bother him.
""Oh I like it, I don't think it's that bad,"" he said.
A frustrated viewer in the comments section of the TikTok video wrote: “He (is happy with) six days. How do you not have breakdowns? I have 28 paid days plus eight paid public holidays and that is not enough.""
“How has he been brainwashed to like six days a year as annual leave? That is crazy,” another noted.
One woman revealed she received 15 days of annual leave which Beyond_Strategy confirmed as the ""highest"" amount they heard during their interviews. It is just over half of what Australian workers are entitled to as a bare minimum.
The video ended with one US woman taking the spotlight after revealing she received zero days of annual leave.
Beyond_Strategy captioned the TikTok video writing: ""“It has been interesting asking Americans about work culture this past week with Beyond.""
As a New Zealand based company, they also revealed employees in NZ are entitled to four weeks of paid annual leave.
People from around the world flocked to the TikTok's comment section to express just how grateful they are for the leave entitlements in their countries.
“Shocked in Australian. I get 35 days plus public holidays,” one shared, adding that they also get long service leave.
“Here’s me thinking 28 days wasn’t enough, glad we get more than America,” another said.
""Even the lowest paid UK jobs gets 20 days plus public holidays,"" a Brit said.
""UK. I get 34 days plus eight bank holidays. Free health care. Six months fully paid sickness absence and a further six months at half pay. Why is everything in the US so behind the rest of the world?"" another Brit wrote.
""In France I get seven weeks off (42 days) plus 12 days public holidays. Five weeks (30 days) is the minimum legal requirement here,"" one wrote all the way from France.
Many expressed their concern at how US workers managed work- life balance with one viewer noting: “Americans live to work and Aussies work to live.""
Another viewer said: ""I got two weeks when I moved there as a Norwegian. Had to use them all when my mom got sick. In Norway, they would have given me those two weeks for free, paid.""",SKY News,lifestyle
'Corporate activism has reached peak stupidity': Pub giant may still enforce public holiday surcharge after backflipping on Australia Day ban,Sumaiya Chowdhure,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/trending/corporate-activism-has-reached-peak-stupidity-pub-giant-may-still-enforce-public-holiday-surcharge-after-backflipping-on-australia-day-ban/news-story/bcd63b7a2f27bb75e515ddfd011a63cb,"A pub giant which planned to axe all Australia Day celebrations at their venues before a remarkable backflip may still be enforcing a public holiday surcharge on customers.
Australian Venue Company (AVC), operates more than 200 pubs across the country and reportedly notified their venue managers the group will be striking all Australia Day celebrations on January 26 due to the ""hurt"" the day has caused for ""some members of our community"".
The Hong Kong-owned pub group, however, failed to disclose whether customers would still be subject to a public holiday surcharge after being forced to retract their ban following threats to boycott and mass public outrage.
After appearing to backflip on the ban, AVC revealed in a statement on Monday their comments caused ""concern and confusion"".
“We sincerely regret that — our purpose is to reinforce community in our venues, not divide it,” a spokesman said.
“It is not for us to tell anyone whether or how to celebrate Australia Day.
Whether you choose to celebrate Australia Day or not, everyone is welcome in our pubs, always. We have been, and are always, open over Australia Day and we continue to book events for patrons.”
Liberal Senator Hollie Hughes said Australians had rejected the concept of businesses engaging in political debate, in reference to the hospitality giant potentially enforcing a 15 percent surcharge or more for public holiday.
""Corporate activism has reached peak stupidity and Australians have voted against it during the Voice referendum and should vote against this rubbish with their wallets,"" Ms Hughes told Sky News.
""If the called-Australian Venue Co wants to charge a surcharge, I am assuming their corporate conscious is seeing them donating those funds to an indigenous charity or is it just a profit grab?""
According to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), businesses can legally impose a public holiday surcharge, however customers must be made aware of it.
There is also no limit on what the surcharge can be and businesses are free to charge as little or as high they deem suitable. This is due to the additional costs required to run an establishment on public holidays.

The online shopping deals bonanza kicks off next week, with 46 per cent of Australians planning to do their holiday shopping on Black Friday or on Cyber Monday on December 2 — up from 38 per cent last year, according to new data from Cyber Safety company Norton.
The Norton Cyber Safety Insights Report found 62 per cent of Aussies admitted to being easily swayed by discounts — up from 57 per cent last year - and one in 16 (6 percent) would purchase from a questionable website or third-party seller.
Threat data found while shoppers are keen for discounts, ""malvertising"" and adware are the cyber threats which increase the most dramatically during the holiday season.
During last year's shopping season, malvertising attacks, malicious ads often seen by users when searching for sales, increased by more than 53 percent.
Adware, malicious software often distributed via malvertising, increased by 227 percent during the same period.
Norton Managing Director Asia Pacific Mark Gorrie said shoppers need to be vigilant while getting a good deal, as he projected an increase in delivery scams this year.
""Black Friday and Cyber Monday offer great opportunities to save, especially as many Australians are feeling the pressure of rising living costs,"" he said.
""It’s expected that Aussies will spend over $6 billion across this four-day shopping weekend.
“We won’t just see scams and digital traps around shopping during this period. Scammers are smart and will find other ways to utilise this event; we will likely see an increase in Australia Post and delivery scams as a surge in online purchases happens. Aussies need to be vigilant across all digital activities.”
Mr Gorrie shared his top tips on how to prepare for and defend against scams this holiday season:
The data comes amid warnings that scammers are using elaborate designs and layouts, stolen logos, a “.com.au” domain name and a stolen Australian Business Number (ABN) to make their sites appear like the actual online stores of popular Australian brands.
Many of these websites offer luxury items at meager prices.

Surfers popularised the boots in the 1960s, and they skyrocketed to international fame as a fashion trend in the 2000s.
Four years after UGG Since 1974 was launched, UGG was founded in California in 1978 by Australian surfer Brian Smith, before Deckers Brands acquired it in 1995 for $14.6 million (AUD $23.6 million).
Mr Watts described fighting the lawsuit against the multi-billion dollar US designer as “extremely hard, especially as a family-owned Australian made business.”
“Due to this scenario, we have decided to transition our brand to Since 74,” he said.
“In Australia and New Zealand, we will always, forever, be UGG Since 1974.”
""But for those boots leaving our borders and heading over to your guys overseas, we will transition our brand to Since 74. Nothing else changes.""

"'Thanks, Dr Sheargold': Expert takes aim at controversial radio host after making shocking claim about women's health",Sumaiya Chowdhure,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/trending/thanks-dr-sheargold-expert-takes-aim-at-controversial-radio-host-after-making-shocking-claim-about-womens-health/news-story/c9507bc26a177e29178233be5b62b5d3,"A Brisbane-based obstetrician gynaecologist has taken a sarcastic aim at radio host Marty Sheargold after he claimed a chronic women's health condition ""is made up"".
The now axed Triple M host has had a controversial week on-air after he made sexist remarks about Australia's national women's football team, joking they reminded him of year 10 school girls.
On Tuesday, he made further ""misogynistic"" antics about women's health after borrowing a heat pack from a female producer to treat his sore back.
""God, don't ladies carry on. Jesus Christ, there is no end of it. Honestly, endometriosis, and this is controversial,"" he said, before a fellow host attempted to cut him off.
""No, I'm going to say it, it's controversial. It's made up.""
Endometriosis is a chronic disease associated with severe and life-impacting pain which occurs when the tissue similar to the lining of the womb grows outside it in other parts of the body.
Nearly 1 million Australian girls and women live with endometriosis and experience an average 6.5 year diagnosis delay for the disease.
Doctor Brad Robinson echoed the exact sentiments in a social media post taking aim at Sheargold for his comments.
“Sincere thank you to Marty Sheargold for helping me today sort my scheduling out,” the Brisbane doctor relayed sarcastically.
“I stupidly – I don’t know what I was thinking – had a surgery booked for a patient for likely endometriosis, but of course, it can’t be, because endo is not real.
“So, look we’ve just cancelled and I have a free slot available now,” he said, before sarcastically adding: “Thanks, Dr Sheargold”.
Dr Robinson made another follow-up video further explaining endometriosis is ""grossly unrecognised"" and revealed his experience in treating a 32-year-old patient with the painful condition.
“So, yesterday I finally took to the theatre my patient and found the ‘disease that doesn’t exist’ and excised two fairly significant areas of disease,” he said.
“That is easily more than half her life, that the symptoms have not been addressed. Due to a range of factors including societal condition and medical inattention.
“The medical system has really let women down for such a long period of time over reproductive health and menstrual health.”
A woman in the doctor's comments section said her daughter waited 18 years before receiving a diagnosis.
""My daughter waited 18 years before she got her diagnosis and now she probably can’t have children because they left her too long… 'it’s all in your head', 'you just have to get on with it', are in the list of things doctors have told her over the years…,"" the woman revealed.
Women with similar experiences also commented about their long journey with the painful condition and thanked the doctor for advocating for the ""unrecognised"" disease.
""Most of my childhood I was dragged from dr to dr in debilitating pain with no answers other than antibiotics,"" another wrote.
""It was not until I was 19 and I had my fourth presentation at emergency that the registrar asked if I’d ever seen a gynae.
""I had seen every other specialist possible, with no answers. Every day was an absolute struggle to survive. One visit to a gynae and surgery revealed endo absolutely everywhere including the bladder and bowel.""
""After a GP told me I was exaggerating symptoms, thanks to my persistent mum I was diagnosed at 17 (51 yrs old now) was told if untreated for another year it would have been a hysterectomy,"" a third woman wrote.
On Wednesday, Sheargold was dropped by Triple M after revealing in a statement it ""takes its responsibility to listeners, shareholders, and clients seriously and its programming should align with the standards and expectations of its audience"".
""Right now, it's clear this is a moment for reflection and review. Triple M, and the wider SCA network, will continue to take all necessary steps to support staff,"" the firm's chief content officer Dave Cameron said in a statement.",SKY News,lifestyle
LeBron James steps away from LA Lakers for ‘personal reasons’ as he plays some of the worst basketball of his career,Unknown,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/trending/lebron-james-steps-away-from-la-lakers-for-personal-reasons-as-he-plays-some-of-the-worst-basketball-of-his-career/news-story/1a1a09bdba4ebc54900f348f1aa4090c,"LeBron James appears to be searching for answers as he steps away from the Lakers amid a worrying decline and swirling trade rumors.
“LeBron is not with the team right now,” JJ Redick told reporters while at practice on Wednesday.
“He’s out for personal reasons, excused absence.”
James missed his first game of the season on Sunday against the Blazers — a 107-98 victory — after previously setting a goal to play all 82 in his age-40 season.
Redick added that James would “take some time” after struggling mightily in his last few games, including an 0-for-20 stretch from beyond the 3-point line.
It comes during a lull in the Lakers schedule as they have four days between games — thanks to the NBA Cup — with their next matchup coming in Minnesota on Friday.
it is unclear if James will return for that game.
Also on Wednesday, ESPN’s Brian Windhorst said the Warriors will “definitely monitor” James’ status as they look for another star alongside Stephen Curry.
With the 82-game pipe dream now dead, the Lakers can focus on resting their all-time great forward and deploy him in more strategically.
James has appeared exhausted of late after playing in all 23 games up to that point, clearly conserving energy and putting in less defensive effort.
The advanced stats show James is slowly starting to show his age and it is trickling into his game.
James’ counting stats are still excellent, playing 35 minutes per game while scoring 23 points, with eight rebounds and 9.1 assists.
James’ -8.4 net rating is the worst among all Lakers starters and by far the worst figure of his career.
James also has a 12.5 percent turnover ratio, a career worst.
Perhaps some time off will do everyone some good as the league’s oldest team gets some time to recover, having just passed the quarter mark through the NBA season.
The Lakers had lost seven of their past 10 games after a promising 10-4 start under Redick.
“Heck, if somebody wants to go spend a couple of nights in Santa Barbara and relax, that’s fine too,” Redick said after the Blazers game.

Man dies in horror shark attack off Central Queensland coast while spearfishing off the coast of popular island with his family,Laurence Karacsony,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/trending/man-dies-in-horror-shark-attack-off-central-queensland-coast-while-spearfishing-off-the-coast-of-popular-island-with-his-family/news-story/ef5e9984aba99fd49b744221126562f8,"A 40-year-old man was killed by a shark on Saturday evening off the coast of Central Queensland.
The man, identified as Luke Walford, was spearfishing with family members off Humpy Island in The Keppels, about 25 kilometres off the coast of Yeppoon, before Queensland Ambulance were called at 4.37pm.
Paramedics arrived within 20 minutes and found Walford with significant injuries to his neck.
A critical medical team, along with a doctor, worked to save Mr Walford’s life, but to no avail.
A Queensland Ambulance spokesperson told SkyNews.com.au Mr Walford “sadly died on scene” after the horror mauling, succumbing to his injuries a short time before 6pm.
A rescue helicopter was sent to the scene.
Police will prepare a report for the coroner.
Mr Walford’s social media indicated he was a pastor for nine years at the Cathedral of Praise Church in Rockhampton, Queensland, where he and his family lived.
Member for Keppel Nigel Hutton said the community was sending their “thoughts and prayers” to the Walford family.
The attack came within a month of a man in his 60s being bitten by a shark while also spearfishing off Curtis Island, not far from The Keppels.
About 8.25am on December 2, the man was bitten and taken to Gladstone Hospital.
The man in his 60s received minor to moderate wounds to his forearms during the attack, and received medical attention on the island before he was treated by paramedics.
Acting Officer in Charge Gladstone Station Danielle Martin said the bystanders who took care of the victim had carried out “great first aid” to stem the bleeding.
“We don’t respond to these very often but when we do they are a unique incident that require us to work with other services to bring the patient to hospital in a timely manner,” Ms Martin said.
“We were lucky in this case as shark bites can be significant but we were able to transport him with minor to moderate injuries on this occasion.”",SKY News,lifestyle
Australia's beloved radio broadcaster and newsreader Clive Robertson dies aged 78 after battle with cancer,Sumaiya Chowdhure,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/trending/australias-beloved-radio-broadcaster-and-newsreader-clive-robertson-dies-aged-78-after-battle-with-cancer/news-story/a406285b03ee89d9f70e3f91afc95241,"Australia's highly celebrated radio broadcaster and newsreader Clive Robertson has died, his former network Seven has confirmed.
Robertson died at the age of 78 after battling cancer.
He was best known for hosting Newsworld and chat show Beauty and the Beast with a revolutionary career in media beginning in the 1970s.
The high-rating radio star first joined the ABC breakfast show in 1972, working on the station 2BL and also presenting the 7pm news for the broadcaster, before moving to the Seven network in the 1980s.
Robertson was known for charming his listeners with his wit and funny jokes by often diverting from the script.
The 78-year-old is also credited with changing the face of news due to his unique, ""quirky"" and expressive broadcasting style which earned him sensational ratings at Seven.
Robertson was also married to another Seven star,  Penny Cook from A Country Practice.
Fellow radio jockey Mike Jeffreys, who worked alongside Robertson throughout his career, told 2GB he and Robertson had been in touch regarding his health issues.
“I was getting texts up until a couple of weeks ago from him. He was Clive to the end, he was quirky to the end,” he said.
“He told me on several occasions that he was born on the wrong planet, maybe that was the whole approach.
“He would say whatever he felt like, and you know that overworked word – authenticity – he really had that.
“When you saw written down what he said, sometimes it would be shocking, but when you heard him say it, it was funny, and it was what you expected from Clive.
“He was a worldwide phenomenon at one stage, because of the things he would do when he was supposed to be reading the news, and would sometimes do anything but that on TV.”",SKY News,lifestyle

The grandparents from Rockhampton were told the happy news by an official from The Lott straight after Powerball draw 1489 was called on Thursday night.
“You’re joking?!” the winning grandmother said.
“I’m in disbelief. I can’t believe it. This doesn’t happen to us.
“I expected you to ask if we have solar panels, not to tell us we’ve just won $50 million!
“We’re multi-millionaires. I can’t believe I'm saying that. It’s going to take a while to wrap my head around it.”
The couple's winning entry, which was purchased from Card and Paper Shop in North Rockhampton, was an eight-game QuickPick.

Neighbours axed again two years after revival as Amazon fails to renew deal with Australian production company,Isabella Rayner,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/trending/neighbours-axed-again-two-years-after-revival-as-amazon-fails-to-renew-deal-with-australian-production-company/news-story/04c107240d82f0232110c829ae90e5d8,"Neighbours is being axed once again after streaming service Amazon decided not to renew its deal with production company Fremantle Australia.
The beloved Australian soap, which follows the residents of the fictional cul-de-sac Ramsay Street in Melbourne, gripped audiences around the world for 37 years before Network 10 cancelled the show in 2022.
Millions worldwide watched the 90-minute series finale, in which Kylie Minogue and Jason Donovan reprised their roles as Charlene and Scott Robinson in an emotional farewell.
Neighbours was briefly revived when Amazon and Fremantle Australia signed a deal to restart the series on the streaming service and Network 10 also picked it back up permanently in 2023.
Two years later, it can be revealed Fremantle Australia will stop production of Neighbours, with the final episode set to air on the streamer at the end of the year.
Amazon reportedly told the production company its venture into soaps hadn't worked and that it was withdrawing funding.
“Amazon gave Fremantle two years to see if it worked but sadly they just didn’t get the viewers,"" a source told The Sun on Thursday.
“It’s a really sad day, especially for the cast and crew who work on the show in Melbourne.
“This really is the end of Neighbours just as it’s celebrated its 40th birthday.”
In a statement to SkyNews.com.au, an Amazon spokesperson said the series will come to an end on Prime Video in December of this year.
“Neighbours has brought so much joy over the last 40 years to its fanbase globally and in the UK. Forty years is an incredible milestone and we are proud that Amazon MGM Studios was able to have a small part of bringing further episodes to Freevee and Prime Video customers over the last two years, spanning over 400 episodes,” the statement said.
Minogue is one of several stars, including Margot Robbie, who rose to fame in the fictional suburb of Erinsborough.
Other world-famous Australians who once lived in the drama-filled cul-de-sac include Russell Crowe and Liam Hemsworth.
The Princess of Pop opened up about her emotional return to the set of Neighbours for the final time in 2023 as she paid tribute to the show being ""a part of our history.""
""It was emotional going back to the set and felt beautiful, actually, the fact that we could see each other,"" she said in an interview.
""I haven't seen these people in, some of them, for over 30 years.
""And, you know, life passes by and we've all gone through different stuff. And just to kind of be face-to-face and say, wow, this is part of our history. It was great.""
Since its return in 2023, Neighbors has soared in popularity in the US, and the show was nominated for its first daytime Emmy Award for a Daytime Drama Series.
In 2024, the soap also ranked second on Amazon Prime and first on Amazon Freeve in the UK.",SKY News,lifestyle

The player won the complete $50 million Oz Lotto jackpot on Tuesday night, but officials are still waiting to hear from the winner.
It is understood the winning Lotto ticket was unregistered, meaning the Lott is unable to reach out to the lucky millionaire and confirm the life-changing news.
Tuesday night's win was the second-biggest to land in South Australia in 2024, championing a successful year for the state.
The South Australian entry drawn on December 10 was the only division one winning entry nationally in Oz Lotto draw 1608.
The state also celebrated the biggest individual lottery winner in May who was an Adelaide man pocketing a $150 million Powerball prize.
The Lott spokesperson Matt Hart said he was eagerly waiting for Australia’s newest multi-millionaire to make contact and start the prize claim process.
""Tonight, a mystery player joined the multi-millionaire club by winning $50 million, but they possibly don’t know it yet!: he said.
“We can’t wait for them to discover this winning news! Just imagine how $50 million might change your plans for Christmas and the year ahead.
“There are 50 million reasons why all South Australian players who had an entry in tonight’s draw should check their tickets as soon as possible.

Dreamworld announces major change to wildlife interactions after handler hospitalised from being mauled,Sumaiya Chowdhure,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/trending/dreamworld-announces-major-change-to-wildlife-interactions-after-handler-hospitalised-from-being-mauled/news-story/dc737ed0dfc3c3c836fd9bf123119078,"Australia's largest theme park will no longer allow human interactions with its tigers after a harrowing incident left a handler with serious injuries in September.
Dreamworld's experienced handler, Melissa Reynolds, 47, was hospitalised after being attacked by a resident tiger in an enclosure.
She suffered ""serious lacerations and puncture wounds"" to her arm and shoulder after being bitten and scratched by a five-year-old 180kg tiger.
The incident follows two other handlers in 2011 who were also injured by tigers and required treatment in hospital.
While the theme park stopped allowing visitors close interactions with tigers, including photos and walks with members of the public, years ago they promised a steady full review after Reynold's incident.
A Dreamworld spokesperson said the move to a non-contact facility was announced in November 2022 and construction on this project has been underway for more than 18 months.
""In November 2022, Dreamworld shared its intention to transition Tiger Island to an environment in which tigers and handlers do not interact directly,"" a spokesperson for Dreamworld wrote in a statement.
""Since this time, Dreamworld has invested significantly in upgrading its tiger habitats and facilities to enable this transition. Construction of the alterations required is near complete.""
The new changes will see a series of fences and gates installed in the tiger attraction so handlers will no longer be needed to move the wildlife animals.
With the introduction of the new safety measures, some handlers have raised concerns regarding the lack of human interaction for the tigers born in captivity and how they would react to the changes.
""The safety of team members, guests and animals are Dreamworld’s highest priority,"" the statement continued.
""As a result, Dreamworld has now transitioned its tiger program to a non-handled operation.
""Tigers remain a critical part of the experience at Dreamworld and for Dreamworld Wildlife Foundation, which has contributed over $2.2 million in funding for tiger conservation projects in the field via Wildcats Conservation Alliance since 2012.""
The popular theme park has assured guests will continue to see tigers on exhibit and in the future will receive a reimagined educational presentation at Tiger Island about the importance of tiger conservation.",SKY News,lifestyle
Ryanair passenger charged outrageous fee for taking water bottle on flight out of Dublin,Unknown,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/trending/ryanair-passenger-charged-outrageous-fee-for-taking-water-bottle-on-flight-out-of-dublin/news-story/a0c2cdfebfd43e6ecdcd28270b355622,"These fees are flying.
A traveller claims she was charged about $63 ($99) to bring her water bottle on board her flight.
Ruby Flanagan was hit with the extra fee when taking a Ryanair flight out of Dublin, she said sharing her story with The Mirror.
Although she claimed the budget airline “has a reputation for ridiculous extra charges,” she was shocked to become a “victim” because of her large water bottle.
Flanagan said she booked herself a “non-priority” ticket which would only allow her a “small” bag onto the flight and opted to travel with a backpack — one she has used to travel many times — for the short trip.
Her roundtrip ticket only cost her about $45 — at first.
She arrived at her gate at Stansted Airport with her bag tightly packed and her 750 ml metal water bottle tied to the strap and settled into her seat with no problems.
However, three days later that was not the case.
Flanagan said that when she attempted to board her Ryanair flight out of Dublin she was told that her water bottle had to be zipped into her bag and approved by the staff who needed to see it fit into the metal box built to represent the underseat storage space she would have.
“I was one of a handful of other passengers who had been pulled aside by the Ryanair crew and were desperately trying to repack,” she recounted.
“After moving a few bits around and shoving the bottle in, my bag now had a giant growth-like lump on the top right-hand corner as the zip did its best to stay closed.”
Unfortunately, the overstuffed backpack was not approved by the Ryanair staff this time and Flanagan was told she would have to pay to get her bag on the flight.
“Thrown by the statement, I asked them why I couldn’t take the bottle in my hand as I did on my outgoing flight,” she said.
“In response, I was told that the water bottle needed to fit into the bag; otherwise, it would be classed as a ‘second bag’, which was not allowed with my ticket.”
To add to her frustration and confusion, Flanagan claimed she “watched other backpack passengers holding laptops, Burger King bags and travel pillows pass through without a hitch.”
Yet, Flanagan and others were being charged extra despite insisting that they had flown one way with the same stuff and been totally fine.
“Each discussion consisted of a lot of hand flailing, a lot of eye-rolling, the word ‘dimensions’ repeated over and over, and a lot of pointing — specifically to the fella with the debit card holder at the other end of the gate who sheepishly waved us over,” she said.
The airline “officially closed the gate” as the arguments continued which caused Flanagan to go into a “state of panic” having never missed a flight before.
She was told, “You’ll have to pay for it either way … out, it’s a second bag and in, the bags too big, so you’ll need to pay.”
As the plane was set to depart in a few minutes, Flanagan finally shuffled over to the staffer with the card reader defeated. She paid about $63 — more than she paid for her round-trip ticket — to bring her water bottle on board.
She later realized it would have been cheaper to throw the water bottle away and purchase a new one but noted “that would’ve been ridiculously un-environmental — and would’ve taken away from the satisfaction of being the over one-millionth plastic bottle of water saved from landfill by refilling.”
Flanagan filed a complaint with Ryanair which was quickly rejected.
Ryanair defended the charge to The Mirror: “This passenger booked a Basic Fare ticket for this flight from Dublin to Stansted (4 Feb), which allowed them to carry a small personal bag onboard.”
“This passenger attempted to board with an additional carry-on, and as it would not fit within their permitted bag, she was correctly required to pay a standard gate baggage fee (€60). Once payment was made, this passenger traveled on this flight from Dublin to Stansted (4 Feb).”
Extra baggage can be purchased for cheaper while booking a ticket.
Flanagan isn’t the first passenger to be stuck with extra fees for what they believe to be a “ridiculous” situation.
A Ryanair passenger was incensed after getting forced to fork over a baggage fee because a wheel was poking out of the size checker.
And another woman recently claimed that she was forced to pay cancellation for her sister’s Ryanair flight after her sibling was tragically killed before the trip.

Laos promises to fully investigate the source of methanol poisoning as Bianca Jones’ father makes urgent public plea,Laurence Karacsony,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/trending/laos-promises-to-fully-investigate-the-source-of-methanol-poisoning-as-bianca-jones-father-makes-urgent-public-plea/news-story/0d6da9d9074edd3ac3835dcd24224be0,"The father of one of the Australian teenagers who tragically died in Laos from a suspected methanol poisoning has called on the government of the South Asian country to make sure there was no repeat.
Bianca Jones and her best friend Holly Bowles died in hospital after falling victim to a mass methanol poisoning after having consumed drinks laced with the toxic chemical on Tuesday.
Father Mark Jones broke his silence after his daughter’s death, telling Nine News on Saturday his 19-year-old girl was on a “trip of a lifetime with one of her best mates” before her life had “cruelly been cut short”.
Mr Jones took the opportunity to urge the Laos government to “investigate this to the fullest extent” to ensure it “doesn’t happen again”.
“We can’t have the passing of our daughter … not lead to change to protect others,” he said.
His plea came amid a secretive investigation by authorities in Laos who have since vowed to “bring the perpetrators to justice” after the deaths of six foreign nationals while holidaying in Vang Vieng.
In a statement, the Laotian government said it was “profoundly saddened” by the loss of life and expressed its condolences to the families of the deceased foreign tourists.
Mr Jones said young men and women should be safe while they travel and create their own life experiences.
“We’ll forever miss our beautiful girl and hope her loss of life has not been in vain,” he said.
According to the Vientiane Times, the Australian girls are believed to have consumed drinks suspected of containing methanol, a toxic substance which is “often found in bootleg alcohol”, and is a cheaper alternative to ethanol.
Jones and Bowles stayed at Nana Backpacker Hostel and the operators of the establishment have been detained for questioning.
The two girls alerted staff at the hostel to their deteriorating health and were rushed to separate hospitals in the neighbouring country of Thailand and put on life support.
According to the hostel manager, the Melbourne teenagers reportedly only drank three local whisky Coke Zeros over two hours on the night of the fatal poisoning.
Local law enforcement told the Associated Press that a “number of people” had been detained,  but that no charges had been laid.
The victims of the tragic methanol poisonings have been identified, including the two 19-year-old Australians, two Danish nationals Anne-Sofie Orkild Coyman, 20, and Ms Frela Vennervald Sorensen, 21, American James Louis Hutson, 57, and Brit Simone White, 28, were named by local news.",SKY News,lifestyle

"Bribie Island shark attack: Marine expert raised 'grave concerns' for swimmers before Charlize Zmuda, 17, was fatally mauled at Woorim Beach",Laurence Karacsony,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/trending/bribie-island-shark-attack-marine-expert-raised-grave-concerns-for-swimmers-before-charlie-zmuda-17-was-fatally-bitten-by-a-shark-at-woorim-beach/news-story/77cf329d6c9e0a13c5790ba8d8bf306b,"A shark expert and marine activist had voiced his ""grave concerns"" for swimmers over a controversial shark control program in the months before a 17-year-old girl was tragically mauled in Queensland.
Charlize Zmuda was fatally bitten by a shark while swimming at Woorim Beach on Bribie Island, north of Brisbane, in front of horrified onlookers late Monday afternoon.
Tributes have poured in from family, friends and strangers in the community, with hundreds of mourners gathering at the beach on Tuesday to remember the lifeguard.
Envoy Foundation founder Andre Borell said he had contacted the Department of Primary Industries - which oversees the state's shark control program - in recent months, warning them about the use of baited drumlines along the Queensland coastline.
Mr Borell told the department he had ""some grave concerns that you are putting people at risk"" by installing the baited drumlines near beaches including Woorim Beach and Nielson Beach at Bargara further up the coast, where a 14-year-old girl was attacked last year, according to The Courier-Mail.
The DPI however says there is ""no evidence to suggest drumlines attract sharks outside targeted areas, or place swimmers in danger"".
There were 18 baited drumlines off Woorim Beach where Charlize was killed.
In a submission written to the department in April last year, Borell said researchers within his foundation had found a ""concerning"" amount of marine animals getting ensnared on baited drumlines which are subsequently then attacked by other predators.
Mr Borell said he had reiterated his concerns on Wednesday to Queensland Premier David Crisafulli.
“We have long held concerns about not only about the ineffectiveness of the current program, but also its potential to actively bait beaches and attract sharks,” he said.
“We’ve raised these concerns with the department, and being ignored time and time again just heightens those concerns.”
SkyNews.com.au has contacted the Department of Primary Industries for further comment.
Charlize's heartbroken father Steven Zmuda spoke after the incident, saying his musically-gifted daughter had her life cut short while doing one of her favourite things.
Bravely speaking on Wednesday, Mr Zmuda did not want his daughter to die without any lessons being learnt, stressing it was important for swimmers to follow beach rules.
""I encourage people to come back to the beach and swim between the red and yellow flags. The only thing that she did wrong on that day was she didn't swim between the flags and I did push for her to swim between the red and yellow flags,"" he said.
Mr Zmuda added he has been struggling coming to terms with Charlize's death, saying he is leaning on loved ones and his other daughter to get through ""weak moments"".",SKY News,lifestyle

About 10.20am, Northern Territory Police responded to reports of a crash in the Fogg Dam, which involved two occupants.
The 63-year-old pilot of the aircraft was ""located deceased"" inside the aircraft, while an uninjured 29-year-old female was winched from the scene.
She was transported by helicopter to Royal Darwin Hospital for assessment.
""A crime scene was declared and investigations into the crash are ongoing,"" a police statement said.
A witness saw the aircraft in the crocodile infested waters of Fogg Dam after seeing it flying at low altitude about 9am.
“They didn’t seem to be having any trouble,” she told NT News.
About two hours later, the witness said she saw a police vehicle with its lights flashing before spotting the plane about 50 to 75 metres from the dam wall.

"Ulladulla, NSW teenager Lily Winward claims she was forced to fly home with stranger’s toddler in her lap due to overbooked flight",Unknown,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/trending/ulladulla-nsw-teenager-claims-she-was-forced-to-fly-home-with-strangers-toddler-in-her-lap-due-to-overbooked-flight/news-story/398af60c681157f3c55c77b34aa9149f,"An Australian woman said she was forced to fly with a stranger’s toddler in her lap during her flight back home from the United Arab Emirates after suffering a panic attack.
Lily Winward, 19, of Ulladulla, said she was flying back on Etihad Airways from an athletics competition in Athens in September when the flight stopped for a layover in the United Arab Emirates.
However, airline staff told her the plane was overbooked and that she would have to be put up in a hotel, the Sydney Morning Herald reports.
But Winward said she did not feel safe leaving the airport at night wearing activewear tights and a singlet in the middle of Abu Dhabi, and that another passenger was allegedly harassing her to get into a taxi with him.
“I was quite upset. I was crying, and I said, ‘I just want to get home; I don’t feel safe going to a hotel, especially with this guy bothering me,’” she told the Herald.
The situation caused Winward to have a panic attack — Etihad staff told her they could squeeze her back on her original flight with the caveat she share it with a toddler.
Winward took the deal and had to endure the rest of the flight, which can take between 14 to 16 hours, with a child on her lap.
“I just think it’s not good enough, for someone who has paid $3000 for flights, it shouldn’t happen,” she told the Herald.
Winward said she and her travel agent have repeatedly reached out to Etihad to complain about the ordeal, but the airline has allegedly kept quiet.
The 19-year-old said she also wants to know why she, a young woman traveling alone, was bumped from the flight instead of a family or couple.
Etihad did not immediately respond to The Post’s request for comment.
This is not the first time an Australian woman has bemoaned her treatment under popular Middle Eastern airlines.
In 2020, more than a dozen women, including five Aussies, were booted off a Qatar Airways plane in Doha and forced to undergo an invasive search and exam when an abandoned baby was found in the airport bathroom.

Penrith 'Pondi' Beach opening day for 2024-25 summer season revealed as Minns govt strike deal with Western Sydney Lakes,Laurence Karacsony,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/trending/penrith-pondi-beach-opening-day-for-202425-summer-season-revealed-as-minns-govt-strike-deal-with-western-sydney-lakes/news-story/104c4b0264591c469648fba5afdbb16a,"Penrith Beach, dubbed ""Pondi"" by locals, is set to reopen this week after the state government successfully negotiated with the private landowners.
Beachgoers will be able to dip their toes and have a splash this Saturday, December 7, with Pondi opening from 10am to 7pm for the 204-25 summer season.
The Daily Telegraph revealed Penrith Beach, which is situated on private property owned by Western Sydney Lakes, required the Minns government to negotiate a yearly agreement to open the water hole each season.
Pondi will be operational from Saturday until the end of April 2025, and will remain open on Christmas Day.
According to the masthead, Western Sydney Lakes is pushing to approve a multi-use lakeside precinct proposal across the 2,000 hectares of land which required government rezoning.
The opening date was speculated to have been a subject of debate between the Minns government and the landowners as negotiations over the continued development of the Lakehouse and Southbank precinct site remains ongoing.
In a memo released by Western Sydney Lakes in June, the landowners said the summer season would be ""welcomed by the community"" after more than 200,000 people crossed the sand in 2023-24, but the delivery of the precinct would be a ""gamechanger"".
After a disappointing debut last year, Western Sydney Lakes Board Director Jacqueline Vozzo said locals ""deserve more"", with the landowners seeking to deliver on their ""vision"" for the site alongside the NSW government.
“Penrith Beach could be the start of great things for the Western Sydney community. The addition of a Lakehouse and tourism precinct, especially with the airport opening in less than two years’ time, would create a world-class precinct that would encourage people to arrive, stay and play in Western Sydney,"" she said.
On Wednesday, the Minns government said the opening of Pondi was a ""trial"", and deemed it a success considering the turnout of people, and announced it was committing $2.5 million to reopen the beach.
The money will fund beach staff and lifeguards, as well as improve the facilities, including the 300 car spaces which will no longer need vouchers to secure.
Deputy Premier Prue Car said in June the people of Western Sydney deserved a place to cool off without ""driving for hours"".
“Your postcode shouldn’t matter when it comes to accessing great places to cool down and have fun on or near the water, and the Minns Labor Government has made it a priority to unlock this fantastic site for public use,"" the Minister for Western Sydney said.
Minister for Planning and Public Spaces Paul Scully said the reopening of Pondi was a ""big win"" and the state government looked forward to  welcoming even more people for the hot 2024-25 season.",SKY News,lifestyle
Opinion online split over 22-year-old single mother on welfare admitting to saving her Centrelink payments for purchasing vehicle,Preston Potts,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/trending/opinion-online-split-over-22yearold-single-mother-on-welfare-admitting-to-saving-her-centrelink-payments-for-purchasing-vehicle/news-story/b6c706b37f481811b8b6167b87816aea,"A single mother has sparked an online debate after she revealed her $20,000 savings for a car deposit was from Centrelink payments.
Susie explained on TikTok she saved up money over the past two years from receiving $850 per week from Centrelink and renting through social housing.
The single mother who is on the Family Tax Benefit told her viewers she adopted a cautious lifestyle to save up her Centrelink cash by cutting out on everyday necessities and un-essential products.
Susie said she had cut out Netflix for Youtube and revealed not drinking and smoking saved her heaps of money.
""I don't smoke and I don't drink. I feel like people don't really truly realise how much that takes out of their bank account,"" Susie said.
The 22-year-old added, cutting personal expenses such as getting her hair done, nails done and cosmetic procedures didn't bother her as she wasn't keeping up with the ongoing fashion trends.
After cutting out coffee Susie admitted dropping takeaway saved her heaps, along with keeping her cat inside to avoid veterinary bills.
""Takeout is definitely not a weekly thing or a monthly thing in this house,"" Susie said.
""Speaking of food. I also don't eat many animal products. I eat more of a plant based diet. Cooking plant-based meals from scratch has been the cheapest option for me.
""Another thing, it sounds kind of strange, i have a cat, i do not let that cat outside and i avoid lots of vet bills by doing this.""
#savings #centrelink #fyp
Her video was met with split opinions with people praising her for being a driven single parent.
""This makes me so happy about where my tax goes! Driven and smart! Go Mumma,"" one viewer said.
""Well done. Where there's a will there's a way. We grow our own veggies which helps us so much financially,"" another added.
On the other hand some people were angry and confused as to why their tax was going to someone's savings.
""My wages are going to your savings account, get a job. Sponge,"" one said.
""What do you mean 'save up' while on Centrelink? I thought it was to cover essential costs, not to save up?"" another added.
Susie said she occasionally uses her savings for food and gets jealous of friends going out as she would have to budget for months to get a night off alone for a babysitter.
""I still have to dig into my savings to pay for food sometimes. I'm saving for university and a safety net right now. Once I'm employed, it'll be a house,"" she told News.com.au.
""The hardest is just watching on as others surpass you. Watching my friends drop their kids off with their grandparents while they have a night out is hard.
""I have to budget for months to afford a babysitter in order to get a few hours by myself. Watching others live rent free at home leads to feelings of jealousy.""
Currently in Australia payments for single parents can be as much as $833 a fortnight and a two-person relationship can get up to $712.30.
Figures from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare indicated 226,500 single parents and 62,800 partnered parents received payments as of March 31, 2023.
Carer, disability support and aged payments have also increased due to the cost-of-living pressures, with singles receiving $1,140.40 per fortnight and couples getting up to $1,725.20.",SKY News,lifestyle
Man reveals how he landed $200k role as an underground miner with limited experience in the industry,Laura Grassby,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/trending/man-reveals-how-he-landed-200k-role-as-an-underground-miner-with-limited-experience-in-the-industry/news-story/2ae1463596fa8abfe6f730422e5cbf43,"A man has revealed how he landed a role as an underground miner with a lucrative salary despite having limited experience in the industry.
The underground miner was recently interviewed on the streets of Melbourne by the job platform Getahead about his job and what he brings in annually.
The man said he earned a whopping $200,000 per year, revealing he hadn't thought of getting into the billion-dollar industry prior to a chance meeting at a barbeque.
How much does he make as an Underground Miner ⛏️📍Melbourne
“I’m in underground mining, (I make) around $200k a year,” the man said.
“Didn’t really have any idea I was going to get into underground mining just, yeah got asked at a barbeque of a mate’s dad.
“He was a foreman at a mine.”
When asked if he had any advice for those wanting to secure a job in mining, the man said persistence was key.
“Just keep trying,” he said.
“It’s one of those industries where it is not what you know it is who you know.”
The miner was also queried about the difficulties of shift work and being away from family for extended periods.
“It’s just one of those things, you do what you’ve got to do to get ahead in life,” he said.
According to job finding platform Seek, the average salary for roles in mining in Australia ranges from $125,000 to $140,000.
However, mining jobs can be tough gigs with many roles requiring their staff to work a rotating roster with long shifts and to move to a remote location.
It can also be a dangerous job, with the industry tragically recording six fatalities in 2023, according to data from Safe Work Australia.
However, mining ranked lower than seven other industries for worker fatalities last year with the transport, postal and warehousing, construction and agriculture, forestry and fishing industries recording the highest number of deaths.",SKY News,lifestyle
US influencer Sam Jones leaves Australia after taking baby wombat from its mother in viral video,Cameron Reddin,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/trending/us-influencer-sam-jones-leaves-australia-after-taking-baby-wombat-from-its-mother-in-viral-video/news-story/1831522ffb86aebf14985d8918566385,"American influencer Sam Jones, who was filmed carrying a baby wombat away from its mother, is no longer in Australia, Sky News can reveal.
Sam Jones, a self-described ""hunter,"" and ""environmental scientist"", shared a now-deleted video on social media where she is seen picking up the wombat from the side of a country road at night.
The influencer carries the animal to a car while a male companion laughs and films the incident, and the mother of the baby wombat pursues her, clearly distressed.
Senior government sources have confirmed to Sky News Ms Jones left the country voluntarily this morning.
Her departure comes a day after Sky News revealed her visa was being reviewed by the Immigration Department, to see whether there were grounds to deport her.
“The department is now working through the conditions on her current visa and determining whether immigration law has been breached,” Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke told Sky News in a statement.
“Either way, given the level of scrutiny that will happen if she ever applies for a visa again, I’ll be surprised if she even bothers,” he added.
“I can’t wait for Australia to see the back of this individual, I don’t expect she will return”.
The Prime Minister issued a blistering rebuke of the influencer on Thursday following growing calls from the public and senior politicians for her to be deported.
Anthony Albanese told reporters in Perth that he was outraged by Ms Jones’ actions.
""I've got to say, I've seen that footage of a baby wombat being taken from its mum,"" Mr Albanese said.
""To take a baby wombat from its mother, clearly causing distress from the mother, is just an outrage.
""And you know, I suggest to this so-called influencer, maybe she might try some other Australian animals. Take a baby crocodile from its mother and see how you go there.
""Take another animal that can actually fight back rather than stealing a baby wombat from its mother. See how you go there.""
The American social media influencer issued an apology on Saturday.
In the first part of her statement released to her Instagram page, Ms Strable said she had been “extremely concerned” for the animals on the side of the road and did not want them to get hit by a car.
She claimed upon realising the joey was not running off, she was “concerned it may have been sick or injured” and made a “snap judgement” to pick it up to see if this was the case.
“I ran, not to rip the joey away from its mother, but from fear she might attack me,” she said.
Ms Strable went on to apologise, stating: “I have done a great deal of reflection on this situation and have realised that I did not handle this situation as best as I should have.”
In a second part to her statement released a short time later, Ms Jones defiantly insisted she was not a “villain” as she hit out at Australia’s apparent hypocrisy.
""Over holding a wombat thousands threaten my life,"" she said.
American political scientist Jim Kessler was embarrassed by the ordeal, telling Sky News the influencer’s behaviour was not a surprise.
“We are craven for attention in this country for doing viral things to get people to notice us,” Mr Kessler said.
“I am sorry on behalf of the entire of the United States.”

Far north Queensland supply shortage strips Cairns supermarkets of essential items - but not bananas - as communities are cut off,Isabella Rayner,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/trending/far-north-queensland-flooding-strips-supermarkets-of-everything-but-bananas-as-communities-are-cut-off-from-supply-routes/news-story/b3ef3dc81fc22929931f243ffba86db4,"Major flooding in far north Queensland has left supermarkets in the tropical region without essential stock - but there's one item that's still been very much in ready supply this week.
Locals in FNQ have been dealing with a supply shortage in recent days amid the state's flooding crisis, with two women so far confirmed to have died near the town of Ingham.
TikTok user Brittany Nash took to the social media platform to post footage of shelves stripped almost completely bare - except for bananas, which are grown locally in the region.
The footage showed basic items such as bread and milk missing, yet piles of bananas are seen stocked in the fruit and vegetables section.
""Why is this the only thing left in the supermarket?"" Ms Nash wrote.
Another shopper posted a video on Tuesday showing a Coles store in the Cairns town of Redlynch, which also had an abundant supply of the fruit and little else.
""We're back to bananas, nothing else. This is at Coles. Woolworths has only a handful of bananas; that's it,"" she said, likening the bare shelves to  the""2025 Hunger Games"".
""Absolutely no bread, no toilet paper, no frozen items.""
Ursula then said she felt like she had ""won the lotto"" when she brought a loaf of bread but had to search several stores throughout the day to find it.
""Oh my god, I feel like I have won lotto. I found bread. I had to go to four shops today. Never in my life have I had to travel from suburb to suburb to get some food,"" she said.
""So I just feel like I hit the jackpot with this, and I went to the local butchers, and there is meat...but at Coles and Woolies, there is nothing.
A Coles spokesperson told SkyNews.com.au teams are exploring ""every possible option"" to increase stock in Cairns stores amid the flooding.
“We are thinking of everyone in our community impacted by these devastating floods. We want to reassure everyone that our teams are working tirelessly to keep stock moving into our stores,"" the spokesperson said.
""We are exploring every possible option to get deliveries into Cairns, whether by road, air or sea.
“We thank our truck drivers, store team members, supply and transport teams as well as local authorities for working together to get food to our communities.  ""While stock continues to be limited we ask customers to only buy what they need so that everyone in the community can access essential items.”
A Woolworths spokesperson said their trucks are ready to cross the moment the floodwaters recede.
""Our biggest challenge continues to be flooded roads - we've had brief windows over the last week where waters receded and allowed us to get trucks into Cairns, however access has closed up again,"" they said.
""We will continue to have truckloads of groceries on standby at road closure points to take advantage of any road openings along the Bruce Highway and inland routes as soon as they appear.""
It comes as heavy rainfall the over the past days keeps rivers at high levels, with some communities hit by almost 2.5m of rain over two weeks.
Warnings remain for towns and residents living in low-lying areas near the Herbert River, with major flooding happening at Gleneagle (above 9m) and Halifax (5.41m).
Moderate flooding is occurring at Abergowrie Bridge (11.05m), Ingham Pump Station (11.49m), and Gairloch (10.74).

The pressure to bring back the sweet treat has been longstanding, with fans creating a petition back in 2020.

""I want to bring back the solo bags of Allen’s famous Peaches & Cream gummy lollies!"" the petition read.
""They were once being sold on shelves back in 2016 and have since then been removed, I can assure you I am not the only one that greaves the loss of the sweet peachy gummies!

Laotian doctor recalls horrific turn Holly Bowles took in hospital after drinking vodka laced with methanol in Vang Vieng,James Harrison,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/trending/laotian-doctor-recalls-horrific-turn-holly-bowles-took-in-hospital-after-drinking-vodka-laced-with-methanol-in-vang-vieng/news-story/98a6926acb456b398cfe40fc2401dc27,"The doctor who treated one of the Aussie backpackers killed after drinking poisoned alcohol has spoken on the horrific turn the young victim took after reporting to the emergency room.
Melbourne girls Bianca Jones and Holly Bowles, both 19, died one day apart in Thailand after drinking vodka laced with methanol in the small party and tourist town Vang Vieng, Laos.
Jones and Bowles were among up to a dozen travellers to fall severely ill and the teens were rushed to a local hospital before being flown to Thailand in intensive care.
Six tourists have died so far.
The dire condition of Bowles, who reported to hospital two nights after she and Jones drank free shots offered by the hostel, was recalled by the Laotian doctor that first treated the Aussie traveller.
“She was confused and she was sleepy,” Dr Yaher told The Times.
“We asked her what she had eaten or drunk, but she didn’t know what had happened.”
The doctor said he initially thought Bowles had taken too many cannabis edibles, popular with tourists, but then the 19-year-old’s condition took a dire turn.
“We treated her symptomatically. We put her on an IV drip and gave her vitamins. But after 30 minutes she had a seizure and went into a coma,” he said.
Dr Yaher said the team proceeded to give her CPR after Bowles struggled breathing and they eventually intubated her.
The medical staff then referred her to be treated in Laos’ capital Vientiane.
Bowles passed away on Friday in a Thai hospital after being transferred from Laos.
Local law enforcement told the Associated Press a “number of people” had been detained and questioned over the poisonings, but that no charges had been laid.
The Laos government on Saturday said it was “profoundly saddened” over the deaths and said it was looking into the incident.
“The government of the Lao PDR has been conducting investigations to find causes of the incident and to bring the perpetrators to justice in accordance with the law,” a government release read.
“The government of the Lao PDR reaffirms that it always attaches the importance and pays attention to the safety of both domestic and foreign tourists.”
The Australian Federal Police said it stood ready to provide assistance to counterparts of the South East Asian country if requested.
It already has a permanent liaison officer in the region.
After the two young women's deaths, the families of both victims started a GoFundMe to raise awareness about the dangers of methanol.
""Tragically, their journey, along with visitors from different countries, was cut short when they fell victim to methanol poisoning — a hidden danger that claimed their lives just one day apart,"" part of the joint fundraising page read.
""This campaign, organised by the families of Bianca and Holly, aims to raise awareness about the dangers of methanol poisoning — a silent but deadly risk that often claims lives without warning.”
The money will also go towards helping bring the bodies of Jones and Bowles home, as well as supporting existing initiatives.

A short time after 8.30am, near the northern exit of Sydney Harbour Tunnel, two lanes were shut down causing traffic congestion for northbound commuters.
Live Traffic NSW warned drivers of changes to traffic conditions along the Sydney Harbour Bridge at “various times” as infrastructure maintenance and upgrades were being made.
The changes included speed reductions and lane closures.
Adding to the chaos, heavy traffic was reported along the Anzac Bridge with delays sweeping throughout Drummoyne to Barangaroo and Rozelle.
In North Sydney, heavy southbound traffic was reported on the M1 Pacific Motorway due to a car crash at Ku-Ring-Gai Chase Road.
One of three southbound lanes were closed with traffic and emergency crews at the scene.
While a Live Traffic alert said the lane reopened, with the crash having been cleared, commuters were warned to allow for extra travel time until the heavy traffic eased.

The new multi-millionaire said she had just finished watching an episode of reality show Married at First Sight when she noticed multiple missed calls on her phone.
“It’s 10pm here and when I saw multiple missed calls, I thought, who would be calling me at this time? I was worried something was wrong!"" she told The Lott.
She is Oz Lotto’s biggest individual lottery winner in Australian history.
The Wester Sydney woman revealed grand plans to buy a place of her own and to travel, adding the win meant she also has the luxury to work less or even quit.
“I love my job, but I won’t need to work seven days a week anymore. It’s actually really nice to think that I won’t need to work!” she exclaimed.
“I’ll finally be able to buy a place of my own. It’s so exciting.
“I’ll start treating myself more. I’ll go on some holidays!""
The Elizabeth Hills local first thought the call was a prank but quickly started ""sweating balls"" when they confirmed the news of her win.
“What the hell! Can you repeat that? Oh my god! Don’t lie to me!"" she said during the call.
“You better not be pranking me! I don’t know whether to believe you or not.
“Internally, I’m sweating bullets! Are you sure this is real? Oh my gosh. I still can’t believe it.""
With the funds now set to change her life forever, the Sydneysider revealed she only treated herself to lotteries when there was a big jackpot.
""I saw $100 million on offer in Oz Lotto and decided to give it a go,"" she said.
“I still feel like I’m being pranked or I’m dreaming.”
In addition to the $100 million division one winner, there were 1,881,633 wins across divisions two to seven that collectively took home more than $42 million in prize money.

"Kim Kardashian loses 150,000 Instagram followers after posting photo of first lady Melania Trump",Unknown,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/trending/kim-kardashian-loses-150000-instagram-followers-after-posting-photo-of-first-lady-melania-trump/news-story/cbd582d13ecd67feef7e5f26eeef4420,"Social media influencer extraordinaire Kim Kardashian has lost about 150,000 followers after she posted an inauguration day photo of First Lady Melania Trump on her Instagram story, according to an analytics firm.
Kardashian, the reality television star and branding expert who boasts some 358 million followers on Instagram, raised eyebrows online by posting the photo of the first lady wearing a wide-brimmed hat at Monday’s inauguration.
Socially Powerful, the influencer marketing agency, analyzed data which showed that Kardashian’s follower count fell by 144,963 since the photo was uploaded.
Kardashian also lost 9,553 followers on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, since posting the image, according to Socially Powerful.
The post prompted some of Kardashian’s Instagram followers to respond negatively, with one writing: “girl…. sold out for far right maga propaganda.”
“Well at least we can see exactly who you are,” another wrote.
“Guys unfollow, don’t watch their show and don’t buy their products. Hit them where it hurts,” another social media commenter wrote.
One Instagram user was offended that Kardashian posted a photo of Melania Trump “but not Martin” — a reference to the late Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
Trump’s inauguration fell on the federal holiday honoring the slain civil rights leader.
The Post has sought comment from Kardashian.
Though Kardashian is believed to support Democrats, she used her years-long friendship with Ivanka Trump to lobby her father to commute the life sentence of a black woman, Alice Marie Johnson, who was convicted of a nonviolent drug offense.
Kardashian continued her advocacy by participating in White House discussions on clemency and prison reform, further solidifying her professional ties with the first Trump administration.
In April 2020, she stated she would not publicly endorse any presidential candidate, focusing instead on her criminal justice reform efforts.

"US fast food giant Wendy's opens first Aussie store on the Gold Coast, sparking long lines and rave reviews",Isabella Rayner,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/trending/us-fast-food-giant-wendys-opens-first-aussie-store-on-the-gold-coast-sparking-long-lines-and-rave-reviews/news-story/9a54803f41c933528d63817f1e3c4c41,"US burger giant Wendy's officially opened its doors on the Gold Coast, sparking lines from 5am as burger-lovers got their first taste of the chain in Australia.
The US brand welcomed Queenslanders into the first Aussie restaurant on Cavill Avenue in Surfers Paradise on Wednesday.
Hours before doors opened, queues stretched down the bustling pedestrian strip.
Footage uploaded on Wendy's official Instagram account showed people cheering and clapping as staff cut a red ribbon held by the servers.
The chain's iconic logo of a red-headed girl with pigtails, modelled on the founder's daughter, beamed down at crowds from overhead.
Queues quickly filtered through the doors, and camera crews hurried to the counter to be the first to capture the workers in action.
People took their pick from three large red screens displaying the Wendy's menu, which includes US favorites like the Classic Double, Baconator, Spicy Chicken Sandwich, and double hand-breaded chicken tenders.
Gold Coast-based content creator Claudia Macdonald took to TikTok to document her first experience at the highly anticipated launch of the chain Down Under.
""Why is this chicken so good,"" she said, biting into a tender.
Claudia then tried the Wendy's Classic Single, describing it as ""so good"" and rating it 9.5 out of 10 on the deliciousness scale.
She took her next bite of the Spicy Chicken Tender Burger.
""It's so yum; if you like spice, that's the perfect burger for you,"" she said.
Food blogger Mariana Bouzeid queued for an hour to treat her 60,000 followers on TikTok to a review of the Baconator and Crispy Chicken sandwich.
""Got to dig in for a Baconator at 9 am. Couldn't think of anything better,"" she said.
""The bacon, the double beef patty, the cheese, the soft bun, wow. I rate this.""
Mariana even said the food was ""100 per cent better than McDonald's"".
""The difference between Maccas is that this is actually hot, the patty is a lot more juicy, you've actually got real pieces of bacon in there, and the cheese is actually melted onto your burger,"" she said.
Wendy's launched its first store in Melbourne in 1982, then expanded to 11 outlets before the Aussie stores collapsed in 1985 with an $8 million debt.
The Surfers Paradise store is the first of a projected 200 stores to open by 2034 as the company aims to win over burger-loving Aussies again, thanks to a partnership with Flynn Restaurant Group.
Flynn Restaurant Group is responsible for the re-launch of Wendy's in Australia, with the franchisee operator acquiring Pizza Hut Australia in June 2023.
Wendy's chief development officer Abigail Pringle said she was convinced Australia was ready to take on the appetite for another US burger chain.
""Australia is a strategic market for long-term growth for Wendy's. Flynn Restaurant Group has incredible experience in the restaurant space, and we are thrilled to expand our relationship with them,"" Ms Pringle said.
""They have a strong leadership team, great culture, vast industry knowledge, success with our brand in the US, and we are confident that Flynn Restaurant Group is the right partner to unlock growth for Wendy's in Australia.""
Other fast-food chains have struggled and taken time to get their foot into the Australian market, with Taco Bell having three attempts to succeed, one in 1981, 1997, and finally getting the ball rolling in 2019.",SKY News,lifestyle
Grant Thornton Australia CEO Greg Keith sparks debate after declaring long coffee breaks a 'huge waste of time and efficiency',Gemma Crotty,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/trending/grant-thornton-australia-ceo-greg-keith-sparks-debate-after-declaring-long-coffee-breaks-a-huge-waste-of-time-and-efficiency/news-story/6003252496df5dd32072d762501c5fc2,"The boss of a leading accounting firm has sparked debate online after revealing what he believes to be a “huge waste of time and efficiency”.
Greg Keith, CEO of Grant Thornton Australia, appeared on the Australian Financial Review’s '15 Minutes with the Boss’ podcast on Tuesday where he was asked about his “pet hate in the office”.
Mr Keith responded that he wasn’t a fan of large groups of employees leaving their desks for extended periods of time to get their daily caffeine hit.
""Going downstairs to grab a coffee and seeing 15 people in one of the teams lining up, waiting for the 15th person to get their coffee before they all go back upstairs,” he said.
""It's taken them 30 minutes or 40 minutes to get a coffee. And that's just a huge waste of time and efficiency.""
The remarks came after Mr Keith made waves earlier this year for adopting a nine-day fortnight system, giving employees an extra day off every two weeks at full pay.
Mr Keith addressed the initiative, saying it was meant to incentivise staff to be more productive in the office.
“I feel that when we brought in our nine-day fortnight, it was really to tackle those sorts of issues and say to people, well, if we can use our time more efficiently, we’ll give that time back to you,” he said.
“In bringing in the nine-day fortnight we have created a number of avenues both directly but also for them to send in suggestions on how we can actually improve those efficiencies.
“So it’s about us listening and telling them that we are.”
Social media users were divided on the matter, flocking to share their thoughts in the comments.
Many were critical as they emphasised the importance of creating a cohesive team.
“Isn’t it nice that 15 people in one of your teams like one another enough to go to coffee and wait until the last person collects theirs before they head up to the office,” one person said.
“Maybe focusing on the wrong thing mate.”
Another hit out at employers’ demands for staff to “come back to the office” rather than work from home.
“We need it for increased collaboration and cohesion. But don’t actually talk to each other and connect. It’s not efficient,” they sarcastically said.
A third commenter suggested the workers made up for the lost time in other ways, saying: “I would be absolutely certain those people work through lunch everyday. All Accountants do, pressure of the industry.”
Another deemed the response the “Biggest boomer answer ever”, arguing the duration of staff breaks didn’t matter as long as they were hitting their targets.
But others were quick to defend the CEO, finding his argument reasonable.
“I’ve got no problem with this level of supervision to make sure nobody wastes any time as long as it extends to ensuring nobody works any overtime either,” one said.
A second user said, “He’s given them a nine-day fortnight. Not understanding the hate?”
Mr Keith also admitted the nine-day fortnight hadn't ""worked perfectly” but said it brought “huge” advantages.
“Our retention rates are the highest they’ve ever been. Our people’s mental wellbeing is the best it’s ever been. Our engagement scores are the best they’ve ever been, and we’re getting more production out of less time, so it’s worth chasing,” he said.",SKY News,lifestyle
"World’s best cities list for 2024 shows Sydney at number eight spot, as Melbourne sits at 20",Unknown,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/trending/worlds-best-cities-list-revealed-for-2024-shows-sydney-at-number-eight-spot-as-melbourne-sits-at-20/news-story/830056ac24064d1153cd11e361ef1bd7,"France’s winning streak continues — but New York City is creepin’.
Paris, France, is on a roll, keeping the No. 1 spot as the best city in the world, according to Euromonitor International’s Top 100 City Destinations ranking.
And it’s perhaps no surprise that NYC landed in the top spot for American cities in the world but No. 6 overall.
The city that never sleeps moved up a few slots compared to 2022 when it landed at No. 10.
The London-based market research company cited Paris for its “unmatched global dominance in 2024,” most notably due to tourism from “a wide array of sporting events it hosted throughout the year, including the Summer Olympic Games.”
Following Paris’ high rating comes Madrid (2), Tokyo (3), Rome (4) and Milan (5). But the opposite end kicks off with Cairo in 100th place, followed by Chinese city Zhuhai in 99th and Jerusalem in 98th.
Only eight other US cities made the list besides NYC, including Los Angeles (18), Las Vegas (23), Orlando (33), Miami (33) and San Francisco (36).
Euromonitor International determines a city’s ranking by analyzing economic and business performance, tourism performance, tourism infrastructure, tourism policy and attractiveness, health and safety, and sustainability.
The 2024 report also revealed that global international arrivals had increased by 19%, “which was driven by strong tourism demand.”
Out of all the continents, Europe is the most popular region for travelers, reaching a whopping 793 million international visitors within the year.
However, the city most visited by international arrivals is Bangkok with 32 million.
“The city surpassed pre-pandemic level of international tourism flows in 2023 and continued dynamic growth of over 30% in 2024,” Euromonitor International said.
Other destinations that experienced high international arrivals include Istanbul (2) with a 14% increase, London (3) with a 7% uptick, Hong Kong (4) with a 19% jump and Mecca (5) with a 20% bump.
“Despite positive recovery projections, challenges like labor shortages, geopolitical tensions and a sluggish economy will persist, limiting city growth,” said Nadejda Popova, global head of loyalty at Euromonitor International.
She explained how less traveled destinations expect a rise in popularity because travelers seek locations with hidden gems that are not oversaturated with tourism.
“Consumers will prioritize culturally enriching, personalized experiences, making them the new travel currency,” Popova added.

Bega Valley Shire Council exposes 'inexcusable' act at popular beach with dog owners put on notice after 'appalling' find,Laurence Karacsony,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/trending/bega-valley-shire-council-exposes-inexcusable-act-at-popular-beach-with-dog-owners-put-on-notice-after-appalling-find/news-story/96ca05816c04e3d087e6515472ccb848,"Bega Valley Shire Council has put dog owners on notice after it exposed the “ongoing misuse” of dog waste dispensers at Merimbula’s Main Beach which has left locals fuming over the “inexcusable” act.
The local council posted an image to Facebook of about 50 dog bags filled with waste which were collected by Landcare volunteers after they were left strewn along the beach in south-east New South Wales.
In its post, the council issued a PSA to alert dog owners it was removing dog waste dispensers along Ocean Drive to tackle the issue.
“We need your help to tackle this issue! Remember, a proper pooch outing means packing your own dog waste bags and disposing of them responsibly in a bin,” the council wrote.
“With summer around the corner, let’s work together to keep Merimbula beautiful for all.
“Note: all bags pictured were found on one day, having been discarded in the dunes within 50 metres.”
The council appealed to the public to bring their own dog bags in the future and to dispose of them properly.
“Let’s keep our beautiful Main Beach clean and safe for everyone!” the council said.
Commenting on the post, the Far South Coast Landcare Association said all the bags pictured were collected in the sand dunes while volunteers were removing invasive weeds in late November.
The bags were “tipped out” on the beach path for a photo to highlight the issue in order to send it to the council to “get some action!”
“Should Landcare volunteers have to deal with other people's dog poo?” the Landcare association wrote.
“These bags are NOT composable and will be in the dunes for a long time. I suppose at least poo breaks down fairly quickly, plastic is a much bigger problem!”
The Landcare association said it walks all beaches twice a year from Eden up to Eurobodalla to remove the invasive weeds and found Main Beach in Merimbula was the worst for dog poo bags.
Furious locals called the discovery “appalling” and “inexcusable behaviour”.
One local said the behaviour “distresses” her as it meant all dog owners were automatically “tarred with the same brush”, warning those responsible would be the cause for the removal of pet friendly spaces.
Another local said the council’s removal of the bag dispensers was “not the smartest idea” and would not be the solution to the problem, instead calling on rangers to hand out a “fine or two”.
“Just ban dogs from the beach and be done with it,” one person said.
“If you can't clean up after your dog, don't have a dog!” wrote another.
“I don’t understand how removing the dog bag dispenser will resolve the issue. Sure you’ll have less bags on beach, but a lot more s**t,” a third person added.",SKY News,lifestyle
SI Swimsuit model Olivia Ponton caught up in Joe Burrow burglary story has been ‘hooking up’ with the NFL star quarterback for several months: report,Unknown,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/trending/si-swimsuit-model-olivia-ponton-caught-up-in-joe-burrow-burglary-story-has-been-hooking-up-with-the-nfl-star-quarterback-for-several-months-report/news-story/afc0bc2216f6499ab6c7c96120def5e6,"Joe Burrow and Olivia Ponton have reportedly been “hooking up” since early fall.
An insider claimed to People Tuesday that the Cincinnati Bengals quarterback and Sports Illustrated Swimsuit model are seeing each other but “keeping it casual.”
Page Six reached out to reps for Burrow and Ponton for comment but did not immediately hear back.
Rumors of a romance between the pair amped up last week after both People and TMZ reported that Ponton, 22, is the one who alerted police that 28-year-old Burrow’s $7.5 million Ohio home was robbed on Dec. 9 as he was playing against the Dallas Cowboys.
Ponton reportedly called the police at 8:15 p.m. local time and said she saw a “shattered bedroom window” and “the room ransacked”.
In an alleged separate call, she notably said it was her home that had been burglarized.
When police officers arrived, the social media influencer claimed she was employed by the NFL star.
Neither Ponton nor Burrow have commented on the speculation regarding their relationship.
Following the robbery, the pro athlete said his “privacy has been violated in more ways than one.”
“And way more is already out there than I would want out there and that I care to share, so that’s all I got to say about that,” he added.
Burrow’s love life was speculated about even before Ponton was in the picture. He was last known to be dating his college sweetheart, Olivia Holzmacher, and they were at the center of engagement rumors in August 2023.
The pair — who had gotten together no later than 2017 — never confirmed the rumors and kept their relationship extremely private.
Fans began questioning their status this year, especially after Holzmacher was missing from a group photo that featured more than two dozen Bengals WAGS.
They still follow each other on Instagram, but Burrow has not shown up on Holzmacher’s feed since June 2023.

The woman, who goes by Sash and Lady on TikTok, took to the social media platform earlier this month and claimed to show proof of a ""weird"" survey the CEO asked her to complete during the hiring process.
She said some questions were ""strange"" but described one as the ""mother of all red flags"",
""(What is) your relationship status today,"" the question read.
The six options to answer were 'married', 'single', 'in a long-term relationship', 'married with children', 'in a new relationship', and 'I don't know what I'm in, I'm confused'.
""Obviously, straight away, I know this is highly inappropriate, and I'm absolutely not answering that, it's got nothing to do with the role or my ability to complete the role,"" the woman said.
She said she messaged the CEO to say she would not proceed with the interview process because she found the survey ""inappropriate"", and thanking him for his time.
""Thinking, he would write back, being like, 'Yeah, cool. Thanks. See you later.' And that would be the end of it,"" she said.
However, she showed a screenshot of the CEO's response in which he reiterated the relationship status question.
""I still ask it anyway because from our culture perspective, it's important for me to know what kind of mental stability someone is when they are planning to look after our team, and in that knowing their ability to manage relationships shows a lot for myself,"" he wrote.
""I'll consider this kind of connection of knowledge to be a deal breaker for you?
""The choice is yours, you don't need to answer.""
The woman said it was certainly a deal breaker, urging her viewers to be cautious about ""boundaries"" within the workplace.
""If anyone ever asks you a question that is inappropriate that has nothing to do with the role, absolutely run for the hills,"" she said.
""Because this kind of individual clearly has absolutely no boundaries.
""If they have no boundaries when it comes to your personal and professional life, they're going to continue to push those boundaries within a workplace. ""
She said she was shocked ""managers like this exist,"" adding, ""I cannot believe this actually happens behind closed doors.""

The McFlurry, based off the Cadbury sweet treat, is topped with chocolate-coated honeycomb Crunchie pieces and drizzled with caramel sauce.
A caramel-flavoured thickshake will also be available in restaurants until January 22.
The Squad Down Under Bundle completes the new menu launch, which gives customers the choice of two core burgers, four medium Vegemite McShaker Fries and four medium drinks.
Anyone who purchases the value box, which feeds four people, will also score a Squad Bucket Hat.
McDonald’s Marketing Director for Australia Amanda Nakad ​​​​said the new menu items are in celebration of ""what it means to be Aussie"".
""This summer, we’re serving up Aussie favourites with a menu full of local flavours and feel-good moments,"" she said in a statement on Wednesday.
""From the return of the McOz to the new Vegemite McShaker Fries, we’re making every Macca’s run this summer a celebration of what it means to be Aussie.""
The release comes after the Grimace Shake hit restaurants Down Under in October last year, sending Aussie customers into a frenzy over the highly sought-after item in the United States.
Grimace is a purple character which appeared in various McDonaldland commercials back in the 1970s.
The campaign kicked off a social media trend, where people posted videos of themselves tasting the shake under the hashtag #GrimaceShake.",SKY News,lifestyle
Qantas launches seven-day discounted fare deal to 60 capital city and regional destinations across Australia,Des Houghton,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/trending/qantas-launches-sevenday-discounted-fare-deal-to-60-capital-city-and-regional-destinations-across-australia/news-story/20da529d5edcfc9bd6d06b65b36b5120,"The airline price war is hotting up again with Qantas offering discounted fares for business and economy seats to 60 destinations.
Fly Melbourne to Sydney ($149), Brisbane to Sydney ($139), Sydney to Tamworth ($129), Adelaide to Melbourne ($139), Hobart to Sydney ($139) or Brisbane to Hamilton Island ($159).
The flights must be booked within the next seven days to get the lower fares, the airline’s domestic services chief executive Markus Svensson said.
He said the sale fares were for travel from April 29 to June 26, July 22 to September 18, and from October 14 to December 10.
“Today another one million sale fares will become available across our domestic business and economy cabins offering customers more choice and more value for their travel this year,” Mr Svensson said.
“And with 60 regional and capital city destinations covered, it’s a fantastic opportunity for those looking to book a weekend getaway, family interstate trip or travelling for business.”
The discounted fares include cheaper excursions to and from many of Australia’s important regional cities including the Gold Coast, Burnie, Albury, Bendigo, Ballina and Coffs Harbour.
Mr Svensson said there were more than 35 routes under $150.
Brisbane travellers appear to be the winners in the business class arena with cheaper flights to Sydney ($499), Melbourne ($549), Proserpine ($369), Newcastle ($369) and Cairns ($549).
Qantas is keen to claw back market share after it was narrowly toppled by Virgin Australia who was named this week as the biggest carrier of domestic passengers in Australia - and the most reliable.
Virgin pulled ahead of Qantas domestically according to figures from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission report on airlines.
In December Virgin carried 35 per cent of all domestic travellers, to Qantas’ 34.6 per cent, while Jetstar benefited from the summer holiday season with 29 per cent.
It was the first time Virgin has beaten the flying kangaroo.
Virgin was also recognised as a more reliable airline on-time performance data for January released by the Bureau of Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Economics.
A total of 76.9 per cent of Virgin services arrived on time.
The Qantas score was 75.6 per cent.",SKY News,lifestyle
Mixed reaction as customer laments high grocery prices during small shopping haul at Coles,Patrick Staveley,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/trending/mixed-reaction-as-customer-laments-high-grocery-prices-during-small-shopping-haul-at-coles/news-story/43223d14ab7d3b8728f5df1ddb77e99e,"A shopper has sparked debate amongst Australians after sharing the cost of her grocery haul that included just six items at Coles.
In a five-second video posted to TikTok, the customer panned from the self-service screen to the bagging area to show how much the small selection cost her.
""What a short five min trip to Coles cost me,"" the caption read.
In total, the six items cost the shopper a lofty $80.95.
The items were Colgate toothpaste ($3.50), a L'Oreal hair product ($30), raw prawns ($29), noodles ($3.95), a six-pack of Up & Go ($12) and brown onions ($2.50).
Some commenters did not have sympathy though, as they were quick to single out the price of the two most expensive purchases from the shopping trip.
""Why are you complaining when you decided to buy prawns and L'Oreal?"" one asked.
""This is hardly a post to complain about when you're buying luxury items,"" another said.
""L'Oreal $30, whole 1kg of prawns $29. Don't buy stuff you can't afford maybe?"" a third commented.
The poster of the video hit back, responding: ""I didn't say I can afford. I am just how surprised at how much I (spent) for a quick grocery trip during my walk"".
My grocery prices #inflation #broke check how many items I have
The woman received support from others, as many shared the same pain of paying large amounts of money for a small collection of items.
""Why is everyone attacking this poor woman? She wasn’t complaining she was just saying how little for the price,"" one said.
""I know as I’m sure everyone else knows as well how freaking expensive groceries have got, especially after Covid and that’s a fact every thing went up in price.""
""People can not accept that this is okay right? When I was a kid a $150 shop was a big shop that would last close to a week,"" another commented.
""Now five items is about $80 even if it is prawns that is the most expensive it’s only half the price of those other five items.""
""Comments are brutal. No one gets the point that a small amount of items shouldn't cost that much,"" a third said.",SKY News,lifestyle

A 17-year-old girl was found deceased at Wappa Falls after falling from a height, failing to resurface about 2.30pm.
According to police, an “acquaintance” of the girl, a 17-year-old boy, jumped into the water to rescue her, but he too failed to resurface.
A major search and rescue effort was launched about 2.50pm, with the Queensland Fire Department and police divers working to locate the two young people.
About 3.30pm, the missing girl was found dead in the water by emergency services.
Almost four hours later, about 7.25pm, the boy was found dead by divers.

"Royal Caribbean mega cruise ship Icon of the Seas set to dominate global travel news in 2025, along with 'spectacular' $1 billion Grand Egyptian Museum",Des Houghton,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/trending/royal-caribbean-mega-cruise-ship-icon-of-the-seas-set-to-dominate-global-travel-news-in-2025-along-with-spectacular-1-billion-grand-egyptian-museum/news-story/2e27c94d50ebf50f0cf91b364a65737f,"A mega museum and the arrival of a mega cruise ship will almost certainly dominate international travel news this year.
Royal Caribbean’s Icon of the Seas, launched in January last year is the largest vessel afloat.
If she stood on her end, she would be taller than the Eiffel Tower. Icon of the Seas carries 7,600 passengers who have the choice of seven swimming pools and 40 restaurants and bars with a dizzying variety of menu options.
The 250,800-ton giant launched last year has eight “neighbourhoods” packed with amenities that include a 55-foot waterfall, six water slides, cafes, shops and entertainment venues.
Icon of the Seas has 20 decks.
Jason Liberty, president and chief executive of Royal Caribbean Group, told news agencies the launch had been phenomenally successful.
Other major cruise lines, like Carnival, Norwegian and MSC, will launch “next generation” vessels by 2027.
Cruising is soaring in popularity globally - in ships large and small.
There were fears that COVID-19 would kill cruising stone dead.
However, Royal Caribbean wasn’t listening to word of that, and it began ordering more and more mega liners.
Icon of the Seas was popular with families from day one.
Royal Caribbean was founded in Norway and now has its headquarters in Miami, Florida, the undisputed “cruise capital of the world”.
The company already has more of its Icon Class ships on order.
Next will be Star of the Seas to be launched in August, and a third ship that has not yet been named but will be delivered in 2026. And there are plans for a fourth ship to hit the water in 2027. From early videos I have seen, Star of the Seas looks like a giant theme park with theatres, restaurants and a late-night jazz club.
No fewer than 34.7 million will take a cruise this year, according to Cruise Lines International Association, the industry’s trade group.
In 2023, 31.7 million passengers around the world took to the water. In 2019 there were 29.7 million passengers.
Just how big is cruising?
Shipyards have taken orders for 70 new vessels that will add at least 170,000 berths to the global cruise fleet by 2036.
The world’s largest cruise ships are now twice as big as they were in 2000, the Brussels-based Transport and Environment agency reports.
The agency warns of the environmental impacts. It says there are even bigger vessels planned, some eight times larger than the Titanic with a capacity to carry nearly 11,000 travellers.
Cruise companies are now offering trips to see the Grand Egyptian Museum, GEM, the most spectacular new tourist attraction on the planet, if that is not belittling its historical significance.
It took two decades to build and came in 11 years behind schedule. It cost more than US$1bn and with a floor space of 490,000 square metres, it is the world’s largest archaeological museum near Cairo.
It has been described as a mega museum with the feel of an international airport terminal, although an architecturally splendid one.
GEM has 12 galleries arranged chronologically over 3,000 years, from prehistory and the Old Kingdom through the Middle and New Kingdoms to the Greeks and Romans. Objects from each period are divided into “Society”, “Kingship” and “Beliefs”, The Times of London reported.
Once it is fully operational, it will be able to hold more than 100,000 items, including the complete collection of artefacts discovered in the tomb of boy-pharaoh Tutankhamun which have been languishing in storage for decades.
It is not known when Tutankhamun’s gold mask, sarcophagus and other treasures remain in the old museum in Cairo’s Tahrir Square will make their way to GEM.
Tutankhamun was about eight years old when he came to the throne in 1333 BC and around 17 when he died.
Tourism is the backbone of the Egyptian economy.
What’s next?
China is building a prototype “floating train” projected to reach speeds of nearly 1000 kilometres per hour, faster than even a commercial airliner.
The World Economic Forum newsletter says the new magnetic levitation (maglev) will harness strong electromagnets which lift and propel the train forward on a cushion of air.
A train that fast would get you from Melbourne to Sydney in under one hour, or San Francisco to LA in 35 minutes.
China already has the world’s fastest commercial maglev service. The Shanghai Maglev, with a top operational speed of 431 km/h, has been carrying passengers on a 30 km stretch between Shanghai’s Pudong airport and the city centre since 2003.",SKY News,lifestyle

On Thursday morning, the network welcomed its foreign correspondent David Woiwod to officially join the weekend breakfast couch alongside co-host Monique Wright.
Woiwod who is already a familiar face to viewers often appeared on the morning show and across the network as a reporter, before he was assigned to a US correspondent role based in Los Angeles for the past five years.
It is understood Woiwod returned to Australia this week after hearing from the network's bosses for an immediate start on the hosting chair from Saturday.
“Five years on the road as a foreign correspondent covering the world’s biggest events has prepared me for the major stories, early hours and bad coffee that 3am starts demand – I’m excited and ready,” Woiwod said in a statement.
“In all seriousness, this is a thrilling full circle moment for me. I’m beyond excited to return to the Sunrise family and to keep telling the stories that matter most to Australians.
“Mon is the most talented, generous, hilarious and wickedly smart person to work with and I look forward to riding her coattails until the bosses notice.
“Aussies lead busy lives, so to be invited into their homes on precious weekend mornings is a privilege not lost on me.”
Seven's ex Weekend breakfast star Matt Doran recently opened up about his struggles with mental health on the morning show, before reveling he would be taking time away to focus on his family and pursue alternative opportunities.
""Before we go today, a bit of breaking news from the Doran household,"" he said.
""I want to share with you a decision I've made, with my beautiful wife Kendall - and of course in earnest consultation with our beloved Italian greyhound Murphy - and this is, after five years at Weekend Sunrise, I will be finishing up at the end of the year.
""This is something I've agonised over because it's honest to say this is one of the best jobs on earth, but we think it's right and at the right time - for our little family.
""While I'm sad, and I'm doing everything possible presently not to look Monique in the eye, where I am right now is honestly a place of incredible gratitude for the laughs, the lessons, the tears.
''It is my unshakeable belief this role - specifically, being entrusted with the telling of people's most intimate, most personal stories - is one of the more privileged positions on the planet.''",SKY News,lifestyle

A leg of ham is typically the star of the table for Aussie families on December 25 but amid cost-of-living pressures, shoppers must pick their meats wisely for the big day.
Consumer advocacy group Choice blind taste tested 10 Christmas hams from popular supermarket brands to ensure consumers could get bang for their buck this holiday season.
Christmas hams from Coles, Woolworths, Aldi and IGA were assessed on several criteria including flavour, texture, appearance and smell, revealing Australia's worst tasting ham was also the most expensive.
Choice's taste test showed price was not necessarily ""an indicator of quality"" this year, as IGA's Christmas ham took the spotlight at only $12 per kilogram, beating its other higher priced contenders at Coles and Woolworths.
The Seven Mile Premium Double Smoked Leg Ham, which is exclusively available at IGA, received Choice's winning stamp of approval with an expert rating of 79 per cent.
""Our experts praised the Seven Mile ham for its smoky aroma, moist texture and pleasant flavour. If you're looking for the best Christmas ham to add to your shopping list, look no further,"" Choice Editorial Director Mark Serrels said.
Following closely with an affordable price tag, Aldi Specially Selected Premium Triple Smoked Half Leg Ham at $13.49 per kilogram took Choice's second spot on the list of high-quality hams.
IGA seemed to be in the book of favourites this year as the Naturally Smoked Leg Ham Bone in Fully Cooked also creeped into the favourable list scoring 76 per cent at $8 per kilogram.
Lastly on Choice's top four favourites was Woolworths' Half Leg Ham Bone In with an expert rating of 76 per cent at $8 per kilogram.
""With so many options at the supermarket, finding the perfect Christmas ham to serve at your festivities can be challenging,"" Mr Serrels said.
Choice also included the worst tasting hams for customers to steer clear of.
This included Woolworths' Gold Triple Smoked Free Range Half Leg Ham at $15.50 per kilogram, which scored a 66 per cent expert rating.
Coles' Christmas Beechwood Smoked Half Leg Ham also received a rating of 66 per cent with a cost of $8 per kilogram.
At the bottom of the ranking was Coles' Finest Free-Range Triple Smoked Leg Ham Portion, with a rating of 58 per cent. This ham was also the most expensive on the list, costing $17 per kilogram.
Judges noted the ham had an ""unusual flavour and aroma that is not appealing and lingers in aftertaste"".
“You don’t always get what you pay for … that goes for food, it goes for everything,” Mr Serrels said.

'Includes bathroom': Bizarre Brisbane rental listing with no kitchen access and portaloo in backyard goes viral,Reilly Sullivan,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/trending/includes-bathroom-bizarre-brisbane-rental-listing-with-no-kitchen-access-and-portaloo-in-backyard-goes-viral/news-story/66ff83966dc1598e9b2c82746bf7bbc0,"A Brisbane landlord has gone viral on social media after posting a bizarre “furnished private room” for rent complete with a portaloo and no kitchen facilities.
The listing was shared in a Facebook share house group in the Brisbane suburb of Sunnybank Hills for the competitive price of $200 per week.
The real estate advertisement, which has since been removed, boasted that the rental was a “furnished private room and bathroom only” ideal for international students.
However, upon closer inspection the “bathroom” was merely a portaloo located outside the home that was piped into a septic tank.
Photos of the portaloo, more commonly spotted at music festivals and sporting games than in suburban backyards, revealed the transportable toilet also included a shower.
In another twist, the landlord specified that the lucky tenant would not be allowed to access the home’s kitchen at all, despite including photos of the kitchen in the listing.
Prospective renters would also need to provide a two-week bond in order to secure the keys to the glorified spare room.
In a second post, the enterprising landlord then pitched a “full access” deal which would presumably give the renter access to the kitchen for the price of $240 a week.
Weary Brisbane renters were quick to roast both advertisements with some commenters suggesting the homeowner should be reported to the local council.
On the Reddit page sh**rentals, which is inspired by affordable housing advocate and Victorian Socialists senate candidate Jordan van den Berg, Aussies were outraged by the advertisement.
""More than happy to report it to the council if someone gets the address,"" one user wrote.
“For $200pw — where’s the upside in this sh** show,” a second user joked.
“It’s the picture of the kitchen you won’t be allowed to use for me,” another said.
“So you can’t use a kitchen, you’ll need to eat out all the time, and the external portaloo is a bit f***ing dodgy … in Sunnybank Hills,” a fourth said.
The viral listing comes as Brisbane renters are navigating one of the country’s worst rental supply shortages.
According to PropTrack Market Insight Report, Brisbane has the second lowest vacancy rate among capital cities at a razor thin 1.02 per cent as of May, behind only Sydney.",SKY News,lifestyle
Council pleads with Christmas Day revelers to use Sydney beaches responsibly after 'disgusting' scenes last year,Sumaiya Chowdhure,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/trending/council-pleads-with-christmas-day-revelers-to-use-sydney-beaches-responsibly-after-disgusting-scenes-last-year/news-story/3438ee7eb6bebc32421ba15f0e8dd400,"With Sydney's summer temperatures amping up for Christmas Day, those who are looking to hit the city's popular beaches for outdoor festivities have been issued with a stark warning.
After last year's jam-packed Christmas festivities on Sydney's pristine Bronte Beach, in the city's east, which saw up to 10,000 people hit the sand and surf, locals were left furious by the sight of broken glass, red cups, rubbish, and human waste left all across the nearby parkland.
Residents who saw the stunning beach covered in trash almost overnight described the scenes as ""worst ever"", ""disgusting"" and ""worse than a third world country"".
Some locals also claimed they felt ""in danger"" being near the Christmas Day events, resulting in them wanting to move away from the recurrent chaos.
With thousands of tourists and backpackers flocking to the beach every year for Christmas fun, locals are no stranger to the mess left behind.
On a Reddit post of Bronte beach from Christmas two years ago, in which it can be seen covered in trash, one commentor said: ""Given the council knows this happens every year could they not place a few more bins around? Or a people just filthy animals regardless…""
With Christmas just a day away, locals have now taken to social media once more to express their frustrations over tomorrow's potential Christmas carnage.
Waverley Councillor Joshua Spicer commented on one local's social media post to assure them the council has taken adequate measures to ensure irresponsible behaviour will not be tolerated.
“This includes extra rangers, security, and police, a dedicated cleaning crew with more bins and waste trucks, extended lifeguard patrols, and specific measures for Bronte Park, such as crowd control pathways and temporary toilets,” he wrote on Facebook.
“This has been a key priority for us, and we’re confident these steps will make a big difference this year.”
For thousands of tourists celebrating Christmas away from home tomorrow, Bronte beach will be an attractive destination. The annual Christmas event on the beach has been coined the ""Orphans Christmas"".
In a statement, Waverley Council said it would not tolerate anti-social behaviour and had taken “a number of significant proactive measures to ensure our community can relax and enjoy the summer”.
“The safe enjoyment of our public and recreational spaces is our number one priority,” a spokesperson said.
“We encourage everyone to enjoy our beaches responsibly and safely, ensuring they remain a welcoming space for all.”
Alongside Bronte Beach, Bondi and Tamarama are also expected to see huge crowds for Christmas festivities tomorrow, with New South Wales Police conducting high visibility patrols of the areas “due to significant crowd numbers expected over the holiday period.”
A spokesperson told news.com.au they were aware of a party planned at Bronte Beach for Christmas Day and have been working with organisers.
“There will be officers from Eastern Suburbs Police Area Command, assisted by specialist police, tasked to patrol the area to ensure the safety of visitors and manage crowd numbers,” they said.
“People are reminded to check and abide by designated alcohol-prohibited and/or alcohol-free zones in the area. Alcohol and water don’t mix.”
Police reminded people not to swim or drive boats when intoxicated and said they would have a “significant presence” on the roads and in the water over the holiday period.",SKY News,lifestyle
"This texting habit means you have higher emotional intelligence, according to researchers at Indiana University",Unknown,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/trending/this-texting-habit-means-you-have-higher-emotional-intelligence-according-to-science/news-story/83072e20eb9e3ae9b5494865d8f416bb,"If you love to use emojis, you’re going to heart this news.
Researchers from Indiana University say those who use a lot of emojis tend to have higher emotional intelligence, which is the ability to understand, perceive and manage your emotions and the emotions of others.
Less emoji use with friends and romantic partners is associated with a personality style known as avoidant attachment, which often involves prioritizing self-reliance and independence over emotional closeness and intimacy.
“This is the first study to examine emoji use in tandem with key individual characteristics related to people’s communication abilities and interpersonal relationships,” the study authors wrote Wednesday in the journal Plos One.
Three hundred and twenty adults, mostly in their mid-30s, took an online survey that asked about their attachment styles, emotional intelligence and emoji use.
There are three major types of attachment styles — anxious, avoidant and secure. People with anxious attachments often feel insecure in their relationships and fear being rejected or abandoned. Secure attachment is forming healthy relationships with trust, love, affection and respect.
Over 10 billion emojis are sent daily around the world, and the study authors determined that women use them with friends and family more frequently than men.
People with higher emotional intelligence and secure attachment also tend to employ emojis more often, the new research found.
On the other side, women with high levels of avoidant attachment send and receive emojis less often with friends and romantic partners, while men with high levels of avoidant attachment send fewer emojis to romantic partners.

An extremely deep-dwelling and spooky-looking sea creature was discovered inside a vast trench off South American shores.
This discovery, Dulcibella camanchaca, was made in the pitch black nearly 8,000 meters deep — close to the height of Mount Everest — in the South Pacific Ocean’s Atacama trench near Chile.
“Dulcibella camanchaca is a fast-swimming predator that we named after ‘darkness’ in the languages of the peoples from the Andes region to signify the deep, dark ocean from where it predates,” said researcher Dr. Johanna Weston of Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.
Not far off from a face-hugger in “Alien,” this creature of the deep can use its appendages to latch on to unsuspecting prey. The research team described their anatomy as “highly maneuverable bodies that make them effective at capturing, killing, and feasting.”
Weston added that the white, sci-fi-looking, 4-centimeter-long crustacean is a new species and a never-before-seen genus. It opens the door to further discovery towards the ocean’s bottom half, also called the hadel zone, particularly in the local trench.
The zone was called “an endemic hotspot” by Weston, who is eager to see what else lies in the lurch in the geographically isolated Atacama.
Details of the newly found sea creatures are published in the journal Systematics and Biodiversity. They were part of a larger 2023 initiative to explore extremely low waters.
It involved a mooring system called the Integrated Deep-Ocean Observing System, or IDOOS.
IDOOS used baiting traps and other scientific equipment at a depth just shy of 8,000 feet. After catching a Dulcibella camanchaca, the amphipods were frozen and analyzed at Chile’s Universidad de Concepción.
Co-researcher Dr. Carolina González said the discovery “highlights ongoing biodiversity discoveries in the Atacama Trench.”
“This finding underlines the importance of continued deep-ocean exploration, particularly in Chile’s front yard,” she added.

Police are investigating the circumstances surrounding the crash in Manor Lakes, near Eppalock Drive.
Emergency services were called to the scene following reports a motorbike had crashed on Armstrong Road about 1am.
The male rider was located dead at the scene.
He is yet to be formally identified.
In a statement on the crash, police included a tally of lives lost so far this year compared to last year that showed the figure already 50 per cent higher.
So far, six people were killed on Victorian roads compared to four this time last year.
Police urged drivers and riders to decrease their speed to not only reduce the likelihood of a crash, but to lower the severity of injuries upon impact.
Alcohol and drugs were the second factor listed, with substances which impair reaction times a major contributor to fatalities on the road.
Victoria Police also highlighted fatigue and mobile phone use and cautioned against driving between midnight and 6am.
Authorities also warned against calling or texting while behind the wheel - an offence which incurs a fine and four demerit points.

Seat squatting on flight in New Year riles up passengers: 'Couldn't believe' it,Unknown,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/trending/seat-squatting-on-flight-in-new-year-riles-up-passengers-couldnt-believe-it/news-story/db7fca7c57b3565e5de4834c13bde9ab,"The ""seat squatter"" trend may have dominated travel experiences in 2024 — but it doesn't seem to be going away any time soon in this New Year of 2025.
Travelers continue to reveal their ""seat-squatting"" encounters on social media as commenters chime in and debate the hot issue.
An experience shared on Reddit in the ""r/delta"" forum with the caption, ""Seat squatter caught and rude entire flight,"" has continued to spark discussion.
The term ""seat squatters"" has been used to refer to those who rob the seats that were selected and paid for by other travelers.
Discussing a flight from Cancún, Mexico, to Los Angeles, California, the traveler posted, ""I couldn’t even believe my eyes after seeing all the seat squatter posts.""
The person added, ""We’re finally boarding and this couple about our age (late 20s/early 30s) is in our row, which can’t be right because we’re [in] the middle and aisle [seats]. I tell them they’re in my seat … and they oddly start fumbling around and mentioning they have a dog with them.""
The user said she responded that she was allergic to dogs — and that she paid for the seats.
""They both start fumbling around more and [the] female, who was originally in the window seat [that] I presume they did actually book, and [the] male who was sitting in my seat, both get out of the row so the female and dog can go to the window seat behind us,"" she added.
The man, for his part, then moved to the window seat in her row, she said.
He placed his arm over the armrest, applying pressure to her arm — which prompted her to switch seats with her fiancé in the row, she said.
""Once we finally get off the plane … my fiancé tells me this guy silently fought with him over the armrest the same way he did with me for the entire flight,"" she wrote in her post.
""I cannot rationalize how or why this man did this when we did absolutely nothing to him other than ask to sit in our own seats,"" the poster added in her story.
Reddit users took to the comment section to assess the situation and share their own experiences with ""seat squatters.""
""It’s only happened to me once, thankfully. But my rule of thumb is that I’ll be polite on the initial interaction in case it’s a legitimate unintentional mistake [that] they’re sitting in my seat. In that case, they’ll get up and move and there’s no harm, no foul,"" said one.
Another added, ""Omg, it sounds like you were flying with a bunch of bratty teenagers.""
""I doubt people that are already OK with breaking the rules are going to be great people, unfortunately,"" commented yet another user.
Some users debated the notion of which passenger gets the armrests in the middle seat.
""The ‘middle seat gets both armrests' thing is entirely an online knowledge thing. Yes, it's courteous & makes sense if you think about it, but the average [person who] flies once/twice per year … likely doesn't know or think about it,"" commented one user.
Another stated, ""Everyone knows the middle seat gets both arm rests.""
""The middle person does not in fact get both arm rests,"" another user said. ""That’s a made-up rule and you can’t get mad at someone who doesn’t follow that.""
Gary Leff, a Texas-based travel industry expert and author of the blog ""View From the Wing,"" told Fox News Digital that the person holding the seat assignment on their boarding pass is entitled to that seat.
""[Flyers] may not be able to get what they want from the airline when reserving seats, or the airline may want a fee for the seats they want and the passenger doesn't want to pay — so they'll try their luck on board,"" said Leff.
Leff suggested that instead of stealing seats, flyers can try asking others directly to swap seats with them.
California-based etiquette expert Rosalinda Randall told Fox News Digital that ""it is never OK to seat-squat once on board. Eventually, the passenger with that seat assignment will claim it.""
Randall said when dealing with a seat squatter, it is best to address the situation calmly and in good faith.
""If the seat squatter refuses to move, do not engage; do not recruit other passengers to rally,"" she said.
Rather, ""immediately request assistance from the flight attendant.""

"Extraordinary chicken and beef kebab pie wins 2025 British Pie Awards, amid boom in 'simple foods' in the UK",Des Houghton,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/trending/extraordinary-chicken-and-beef-kebab-pie-wins-2025-british-pie-awards-amid-boom-in-simple-foods-in-the-uk/news-story/ff3830c0dc200d75efc8de3298fe1707,"Would you travel all the way to Scotland for a pie?
Of course you wouldn’t.What if it was an oddball kebab pie named the winner in the 2025 British Pie Awards, beating 900 others in a secret taste off?
The “extraordinary” pie was made with chicken and beef kebab meat with white and red onions, a chilli marinade and a sweet chilli sauce and served with cheese on top has the UK in raptures.
Tourists have started heading to Margaret Avenue in Bathgate, west Lothian to Boghall Butchers to get them.
The third-generation family-run business that bakes 500 of the pies a week has had to step up production, The Times reported.
As high-end restaurants struggle for survival in the UK, there is also a boom in simple foods like pies and fish and chips.
And the UK has much to offer the traveller.
One of the fish and chips contest offerings came with a battered haggis pudding side dish.
Mariesha Boyle, 45, who created the winning pie with her father, admitted the idea came from a regular customer who wanted something different.
Among the entries there was a chicken tikka pie, a Caribbean-style jerk spiced turkey pie with cranberry sauce and a butternut and malabar pie.
There was also a “pie flower” filled with salmon flavoured chaï-matchaï tea with spicy notes of cardamom, cinnamon, and pepper.
Last year’s winner was minted Wensleydale lamb and potato pie made at, of all places, the Middleton-In-Teesdale Fish and Chip Shop in County Durham.
The kebab pie was crowned supreme champion at Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire.
Senior judge Mike Holling said the “pie of pies” had amazing pastry and a well-seasoned filling that ""definitely had the wow factor"".
Pies have been around since the Middle Ages when they were called coffyns, the BBC reported.
“At that time the poor ate pies made from the entrails of venison, which are called umbles - hence the expression 'to eat umble pie'"".
""The pie is Britain's most important contribution to world food heritage,” Melton Pork Pie Association chief Matthew O'Callaghan told the BBC.
""The British eat over £1 billion of pies every year, hot-cold, sweet-savoury and now gluten free, vegan, fusion etc.”
Tourists may still feast on traditional meat and potato pies in the UK.
Some personal favourites are those glorious steak and kidney puddings revived in the UK in the 90s by the domestic goddess Nigella Lawson.
Meanwhile, The Times recently named John Long's at Athol Street, Belfast, the best fish and chips shop in the nation. It's been there 111 years.
A local television identity, Eamonn Holmes, said he would head straight for John Long’s for his last supper.
Northern Island and most places in the UK abound fresh fish with most places close to a fishing village.
Brits devour haddock, cod, flounder, turbot, wrasse, dogfish and lobster.
Haddock is popular at Redcloak Fish Bar at Stonehaven in Aberdeenshire.
Takeaway customers drive to the waterfront five minutes away and sit on the sea wall to eat their catch.
Locals find the Scottish side dish, battered haggis pudding, especially appealing.
The Magpie Café at Whitby in North Yorkshire achieved fame some years ago when the Sunday Times critic A.A. Gill awarded it five stars, a score usually reserved for Michelin-starred restaurants. '
It still ranks.Colmans Seafood Temple at South Shields, Co Durham has been described as downright posh. It sits in a stunning seafront art deco pavilion.
Try local Lindisfarne oysters, crab salad, lemon sole and lobster or takeaways of haddock, fishcakes, or prawn tacos.
Harbour Lights is a waterfront fish and chip shop on Customs House Quay at Falmouth in Cornwall with sweeping views of the sea.
A warning: Outside diners complain of raiding herring gulls that swoop down to steal their chips.Brits like to finish with banana fritters and a scoop of ice cream drizzled with a rich syrup.
Hmmm.
Other top fish and chips shops are Finney’s at Benllech, Anglesey (Icelandic cod), Bennett’s Fish & Chips, Weymouth, Dorset, and Fishers of Hunstanton in Norfolk.
Short stays at stately country houses, and some modest ones, are popular for Londoners.
In first place in a recent Sunday Times list was Coworth Park, Berkshire.
Saddle up for pony rides, private horse-riding lessons or join the estate’s private polo academy.
Both William and Harry have played the sport of kings there.
The estate has lovely gardens and a Michelin-starred restaurant, Woven, which presents classical British cuisine.
Chef Adam Smith trained at The Ritz in London.
Beaverbrook in Surrey is an hour by train from London (if your chauffeur is having a day off.)
It was the home to newspaper baron Lord Beaverbrook who hosted everyone from Winston Churchill to Elizabeth Taylor and Ian Fleming.
This 19th-century manor house surveys the Surrey Hills and sits in almost 400 acres of gardens and woodlands.
There are many activities described as swashbuckling.

Sydney Sweeney slams online body shamers as she transforms herself for role as professional boxer,Unknown,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/trending/sydney-sweeney-slams-online-body-shamers-as-she-transforms-herself-for-role-as-professional-boxer/news-story/a7f45880e6861ed0636d307cdfa861e4,"Sydney Sweeney is holding zero space for any negativity.
On Friday, the US actress, 27, slammed body shamers on social media after online trolls took aim at her appearance.
“Nothing to see here other than an average chunky Yankee girl,” one troll wrote, per Sweeney’s Instagram video compiling dozens of foul comments.
“Too pale,” another wrote. “And she needs to lose a few pounds around the middle.”
Addressing the critics head on, Sweeney – who recently displayed her stunning curves poolside in Florida following a blockbuster year including films such as Madame Web, Immaculate, and Eden – posted a video montage featuring a number of cruel comments about her appearance.
Towards the end of the video, Sweeney shared footage of herself working out in the gym, lifting heavy weights, and training in a boxing ring.
At one point, the video pans to a sign that reads, “Just Don’t Quit.”
Many were quick to praise Sweeney’s clap back.
“It’s always wild to see people publicly out-themselves as pieces of s**t with comments like that,” Lili Reinhart wrote. “You look incredible and your dedication to your project is very inspiring.”
“Strong baddie,” Kesha added.
Sweeney’s latest role as professional boxer Christy Martin has left her unrecognisable. In a recent Instagram post, Sweeney posed in costume alongside the real Martin with both of them holding up a fist.
“We have wrapped filming Christy Martin’s story and it has been one of the most emotional, transformative experiences of my life. Christy’s journey is so deeply inspiring, and having her by my side during this process was nothing short of surreal,” she wrote in the caption.
She continued, “There were moments on set where I’d glance over at her standing by the monitors, cheering us on, and I’d just become so emotional. Knowing what she’s endured, what she’s pushed through to be there in that moment — it made me want to cry.”
Throughout the rest of the caption, Sweeney thanked the cast and crew of the movie.
The star added she was excited for audiences to “witness a story that’s as powerful as the woman who lived it.”

'It's got that Aussie swag': Canadian in Sydney reveals he is perplexed by everyday phrase 'you're alright mate',Gemma Crotty,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/trending/its-got-that-aussie-swag-canadian-in-sydney-reveals-he-is-perplexed-by-everyday-phrase-youre-alright-mate/news-story/64fe29bdf048f05c4c3ee62d1ca089c8,"A Canadian in Sydney has revealed the everyday phrase he is baffled by that many Australians wouldn't stop to question.
Josiah Hein, who has 100k Instagram followers, took to the platform to share the saying 'you're alright mate' after someone apologises was a foreign concept to him.
“So I’m in Australia walking down the street and there’s this cool guy in a suit kind of walking straight for me and then he kind of stopped and I stopped and I was like, ‘oh sorry man’,"" Hein told his followers.
“Cause Canadians apologise like 7.8 times a day.""
He noted the man didn't say ""that’s all good bro"", nor ""it’s okay"".
""The guy said to me, ‘you are alright’, but in the Australian way of speaking it’s ‘you’re right’, like you’re correct, you got the answer correct, but it actually is ‘you are alright’.
“I don’t think Canadians or Americans actually think like that – if someone says sorry they’ll be like, 'you’re G bro, you’re good, you're sweet, don’t worry about it my man'.""
He said it was ""nice that it’s different"", noting ""it’s got that Aussie swag about it"".
Commenters rushed to offer further clarification of the meaning behind the phrase and confirm he had done no wrong.
“Oddly, ‘you’re right mate’ means almost the opposite to ‘you’re right mate’,” one user said.
“You’re right = no need to be sorry it was nothing, there was nothing ‘incorrect’ about your actions,"" a second person commented.
One user dubbed it the “Aussie Hakuna Matata” - meaning “no worries”.
Another warned him to watch out for the slightly different “you right mate?” which other agreed had a “significantly different vibe”.
“Haha yea we bout to fight with that one,” one user replied, while another was amused at the “subtleties of the Aussie language”.
“'Mate’ has a particular bite to it that is hard for foreigners to pick up but is not at all friendly,” they said.
Another agreed, “If it’s ‘yurightmayd’ it’s all good but if we say ‘are you right mate’ then that mate is very much about to not be alright.”
Hein’s social media platforms are filled with videos about other customs and quirks in Australian culture which he finds interesting as a Canadian.
In one he marvels as a crowd of Australians jaywalk illegally, while in another he complains that most fast food chains don’t provide free refills on drinks, and further noticed the way Australians put an “r” sound at the end of “tomato”.",SKY News,lifestyle
'Centrelink of the air': Jetstar flight attendant shocks Aussies by revealing the 'pretty average' salary the airline pays its New Zealand cabin crew,Chloe Walker,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/trending/centrelink-of-the-air-jetstar-flight-attendant-shocks-aussies-by-revealing-the-pretty-average-salary-the-airline-plays-its-new-zealand-cabin-crew/news-story/99fa9231eeeb29974e365f0efb8d17f1,"A Kiwi Jetstar flight attendant has revealed the salary she receives from the budget airline, describing it as ""pretty average"".
During a street interview in Brisbane, she revealed that cabin crew can earn anywhere from $40,000 to $80,000, depending on their contract and location.
""The pay is different, so if you're Aussie crew, which is not me, you're on pretty good pay,"" she told Greg Underhill from the recruitment app Getahead.
""If you’re New Zealand crew, it's pretty average.""
To make ends meet, she said she works two additional jobs on top of her demanding roster of 12-hour-plus shifts, often five to six days in a row with just one or two days off.
Despite the workload and pay, she still recommended the job to young people looking for a ""cheap way to travel"" and described Jetstar as a good company to work for.
""I didn't lose my job in lockdown, wasn’t even close to it, so yeah, I'd definitely stay,"" she said.
When asked what people might not realise about being a flight attendant, she was quick to dismiss any perception of a glamorous lifestyle.
""We don’t just fly one way and have a luxury life,"" she said.
""Our main job is safety.
""...I’ve had everything under the planet with my flights- I’ve had deaths on board, I've had oven fires. You name it, I’ve had it.""
She also described Jetstar's training as ""intense"".
""I believe it’s a bit easier now,"" she said.
""But when I did it… they put you through some tears.""
The interview sparked a wave of reactions on social media, with many shocked by the starting salary for cabin crew.
""Start around 40k? Crazyyyy! Your life is literally on the line - come on Jetstar,"" one TikTok user commented.
""40k is double Centrelink-not nearly enough,"" another wrote, while a third added: ""Yeah, but it's Centrelink of the air.""
In Australia, Jetstar cabin crew can either be directly employed by the airline or hired through third-party labour firms Team Jetstar and Altara.
According to recruitment site Indeed, the average pay for Jetstar cabin crew in Australia is approximately $52,371, in line with the national average.
Mr Underhill noted he has spoken to ""quite a few"" cabin crew members, with wage revelations varying ""significantly depending on the airline.""
In December, the Transport Workers Union and Jetstar reached a 'Same Job, Same Pay' in-principle agreement to increase wages for the airline's 1,500 labour-hire cabin crew.
""Cabin crew are at the heart of our operation, and this proposed agreement recognises their hard work and dedication to low fares flying,"" Jetstar Group Chief Executive Officer Stephanie Tully said at the time.
""We’ve worked together with the TWU to navigate the new legislation and come to an in-principle agreement that delivers wage increases for our cabin crew while also ensuring we support our low fares business model and enable future growth.""

'They're a little bit unhinged': British tourist shocked by Aussies wild behaviour as destructive Tropical Cyclone Alfred looms,Sumaiya Chowdhure,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/trending/theyre-a-little-bit-unhinged-british-solotraveller-shocked-by-aussies-wild-behaviour-as-destructive-tropical-cyclone-alfred-looms/news-story/dfc649c27a25f24b41520b62fa9dc089,"A British traveller has labelled Queenslanders ""unhinged"" due to their wild acts amid threats of Tropical Cyclone Alfred approaching.
The tropical cyclone came to a ""near staggering halt"" off the coast of Queensland overnight, with landfall now significantly pushed back to the early hours of Saturday morning.
According to experts, the slowing down of the cyclone means bad news as the delays would ""allow for continued large and powerful waves to coincide with abnormally high tides"" creating the potential for severe beach erosion and mass destruction.
Several regions in Queensland have been told to prepare on the state government's disaster website. Locals have especially been advised to avoid beaches and surfing due to the cyclone bringing in abnormally high tides.
Many beaches from Sunshine Coast down to the Gold Coast have been closed, but that hasn't stopped die-hard surfers from taking on the wild waters with their boards.
The act has caught the attention of Raxu, a solo traveller visiting Australia, who took to social media to express her confusion towards Australians' attitudes towards natural disasters.
""Tell me why there's a cyclone about to hit the Gold Coast and everyone's surfing,"" she said.
""They're saying the swells are good, they're saying the surf is good, they're saying the waves are good but there's literally a cyclone coming their way.
""Everyone's been told to stay in and evacuate, but they don't seem to take it seriously.
""They're a little bit unhinged. I wouldn't be surfing, bro.
""The Australians are confusing me.""

Thousands of Aussies rushed to the comments to explain their ""laid-back"" attitude with one user poking a joke at the nation's current housing crisis leaving residents with ""nothing to lose"".
""We are concerned but not alarmed. We are resilient. We can’t stop it so we might as well have some fun,"" one user commented.
""The swell is good because it's days before the cyclone, so the waves are big but the cyclone is still 500km away,"" another said.

"Stunned cruise passenger socked with $2,000 post-trip bill after not putting phone in aeroplane mode",Unknown,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/trending/stunned-cruise-passenger-socked-with-2000-posttrip-bill-after-not-putting-phone-in-aeroplane-mode/news-story/f1de6e84cba8c4124ea16d9e0b251d36,"This passenger sailed through their vacation budget.
A Royal Caribbean cruise passenger came home to a $1,300 bill ($2,000 AUD) after making this simple common mistake.
The unnamed passenger purchased Royal Caribbean’s Wi-Fi package when they boarded the boat thinking that it would cover cellphone service, according to YouTuber Jayson Judson.
However, when the person returned home from their adventure at sea, they were shocked to discover a $1,300 cellphone bill awaiting them.
After investigating the situation, the traveler discovered that because they had not set their cellphone to “airplane mode” the device had been racking up roaming charges as it downloaded updates and background data while sailing around.
The person also added charges because their child had used the device to stream videos throughout the trip.
When the person called the cruise line to complain, they were told that it was their fault for not setting their phone to “airplane mode.”
Fortunately, the family wasn’t aboard Costco’s $293,000 around-the-world cruise — imagine those roaming charges!
The wholesale retail company sold a booking for the extensive cruise through Costco Travel.
The six-figure price tag booked the owner’s suite cabin on the ship for two people, according to Costco’s CFO.
But Royal Caribbean isn’t the only cruise line with passengers complaining about unfair fees.
Carnival Cruise Line is facing backlash over a controversial policy change.
The world’s largest cruise company is now requiring all 21-and-over adults in a cabin to purchase its Cheers! unlimited alcohol package if just one person in the cabin opts for it.
This rule has shaken and stirred significant discontent, especially after the company hiked up the price by 17%.
Guests on cruises for six nights or more who used to pay $70.74 per day for the Cheers! package, which covers alcoholic and nonalcoholic drinks, are now being charged $82.54 per person daily, including an 18% gratuity.
Carnival’s brand ambassador John Heald defended the policy on Facebook, where countless “upset” and “disappointed” cruisers slammed the sudden change, calling it “outrageous,” “very frustrating” and “unfair.”
He argued that it was a response to “abuse” of the program. “We did try allowing opt-outs when we first started the program, but it was abused — pure and simple,” Heald stated.
“I apologize, but we have no plans to change this.”

Young Melbourne man second recipient of $100m Powerball jackpot joining Queensland couple in win,Sumaiya Chowdhure,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/trending/young-melbourne-man-second-recipient-of-100m-powerball-jackpot-joining-queensland-couple-in-win/news-story/62328903613a5447671306a042a53e64,"A young man in his 20s from Melbourne has come forward as the second winner of a $100 million lotto jackpot sharing the win with a couple from Queensland.
Just two division one entries were drawn nationally in Powerball draw 1489 on Thursday November 28. Each division one winning entry pocketed $50 million.
An official from The Lott surprised the Rockhampton couple with their life-changing news of a $50 million win almost immediately, however the Victorian man who owned the other half of the win had an unregistered ticket and remained a mystery.
Due to the ticket being unregistered, officials from The Lott had no way of contacting the Melbourne man and had to wait for him to check their ticket and come forward to claim their prize.
However a man from Preston, in Melbourne's northern suburbs, who had never played Powerball before, came forward on Friday to claim the eye watering prize.
The new multi-millionaire said he checked his ticket straight after the draw last night and struggled to wrap his head around his eight-figure prize.
“It feels unreal! It’s unbelievable,” the Preston man said.
“I’m speechless right now. I can’t wrap my head around it.
“I’m hoping to have a good sleep tonight seeing as I barely got any last night after checking my ticket.
“It was impossible to sleep once I realised that I’d won $50 million!""
The man said that despite his big win, he will continue to show up to work but would use his winnings to help his parents retire immediately.
“I plan to share a lot of the prize with my parents and give back to them however I can. I’d love to retire them straight away,"" he said.
The man's winning entry was purchased at Northland Lotto & News, Shop C012, Northland Shopping Centre, 2-50 Murray Road, Preston.
Earlier on Thursday an elderly couple from Rockhampton were delivered the 50-million-dollar news.
The couple were expecting a call from solar panel telemarketing but what they heard next was life changing.
“You’re joking?!” the winning grandmother laughed.
“I’m in disbelief. I can’t believe it. This doesn’t happen to us.
“I expected you to ask if we have solar panels, not to tell us we’ve just won $50 million!
“We’re multi-millionaires. I can’t believe I'm saying that. It’s going to take a while to wrap my head around it.
“I’ve been playing for a long time now – since the game first started. I had always used the same numbers, but this ticket was just a QuickPick.
“I’m in a total state of shock.
“We’ve been pretty happy in life, but this is the icing on the cake.""

'I was gobsmacked': Melbourne mother divides opinion online after lashing beachgoers for contentious cabana act,Isabella Rayner,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/trending/i-was-gobsmacked-melbourne-mother-divides-opinion-online-after-lashing-beachgoers-for-contentious-cabana-act/news-story/89be8c2ca28172d825e66fbad1445a98,"A Melbourne mother has set tongues wagging after lashing out at other beachgoers for setting up their cabana “in front” of her on the sand, a habit that is becoming increasingly prevalent on Aussie shores.
The mother-of-two recently vented her frustration in a Facebook group and shared a photo of the sizeable shelter positioned within a few metres of hers.
She claimed a group had put it there after she had set up.
""When did it become a thing to set up a beach tent in front of other beachgoers?"" she asked.
""I go to the beach a few times a year and this is the first time I’d seen this.
""We got there at 9am, and about 11, someone came along and set up between us and the water. I was gobsmacked and then noticed it was the case right down the beach.""
Some people shared the woman's grievances, with one beachgoer saying they had a similar experience where a group sat ""directly"" in front of them despite other spaces being available along the sand.
""It is strange to have people set up so close or right in front of you,"" they said.
""It happened to me and a friend the other day with a group of people sitting directly in front of us and the beach had a so much space all around.""
Another person said they visit a dog-friendly beach during off-peak hours and ditch a shelter for a naturally shaded area.
""I feel this in my bones. We go to a dog beach, it’s not crowded. We don’t have a cabana and sit in a shaded area. We get there at about 7 am,"" they said.
However, others disagreed with the disgruntled Melbourne mother.
""Beach space is at a premium at a city beach in summer. You can’t reserve the space or view in front of you, only the space that your stuff takes up,"" one person said.
The largest Cool Cabana, which advertises itself as ""the world's best beach shelter"", takes up a sizable amount of 5.8sqm of sand space.
People are becoming increasingly known to arrive early to beaches and ""reserve"" a spot by pitching their cabana before leaving it and coming back later.
Sky News host Caroline Marcus on Tuesday joined the debate surrounding the use of them to mark territory on the beach, calling the act ""un-Australian"".
""I was on the south coast last week for my one-week summer break, and these cabanas were everywhere. I wasn't there early enough to see them empty,"" she said.
""But if I rocked up to the beach and I saw a bunch of empty tents and cabanas, I think I'd just move one if I wanted to get that spot.
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese also weighed in and said the issue of people arriving at the beach early and using their cabanas to reserve their spot was ""not on.""
""One of the great things about Australia, unlike some parts of the world, you go and you got to pay to go to the beach,"" he told Today Show host Jayne Azzopardi.
""Here, everyone owns the beach. Everyone. And it's a place where every Australian is equal.
""And that's a breach of that principle, really, to think that you can reserve a little spot as just yours.""",SKY News,lifestyle
"Iconic tourist hotspot announces 20,000 visitor per day cap in bid to reduce 'anthropic pressure' on the historical site",James Harrison,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/trending/iconic-tourist-hotspot-announces-20000-visitor-per-day-cap-in-bid-to-reduce-anthropic-pressure-on-the-historical-site/news-story/ef0e62f1d921e191eeae286676e7c1b3,"Pompeii has become the latest hotspot to limit tourism as local officials recently announced a 20,000 a day cap on visitors.
The archaeological park which was buried under ash and rock after Mount Vesuvius erupted in 79 AD drew about four million tourists in 2023 with numbers peaking at 36,000 during the first Sundays of each month when free admission was on offer, local officials reported.
Alongside the daily cap, the site will also personalise its tickets to hold the names of visitors.
Pompeii Archaeological Park’s director Gabriel Zuchtriegel said the change comes as the tourist hotspot worked on projects to “reduce the anthropic pressure on the site” which could impact both the area and its visitors.
“We are working to expand the usable areas in the ancient city and to develop the other sites in the area, including Boscoreale, Torre Annunziata, Villa dei Misteri, Civita Giuliana and Stabia,” she said in a release.
“We are aiming for slow, sustainable, pleasant and non-mass tourism and above all spread throughout the area around the UNESCO site, which is full of cultural jewels to discover.”
The daily cap comes alongside the introduction of time slots for visitors between April and October to allow 15,000 visitors between 9am and midday and another 5,000 between midday and 5.30pm.
The changes come into effect from November 15.
This comes after fellow Italian tourist hotspot, Venice, in April implemented a €5 (AU$8.14) levy on day trippers to the City of Canals.
Its fee, which applied on 29 peak days and ended in mid-July, was praised by Venice Mayor Luigi Brugnaro when it came into effect.
“With courage and great humility we are introducing this system because we want to give a future to Venice and leave this heritage of humanity to future generations,” he wrote on X in April.
The City of Canals is not the only tourist hotspot which Aussie travellers have needed to fork out cash to enter.
Bali introduced a 150,000IDR per person (about $15) tourist tax in February for visitors to the archipelago which can be paid online.
Meanwhile, similar measures to limit tourist numbers have come into effect Down Under as well.
Tourist hotspot and Airbnb haven Byron Bay has cracked down on short term rentals as property owners in the area were informed in September they can only lease their properties for just 60 days per calendar year.
The new regulation has sought to address the region’s housing crisis, where lucrative short-term rentals have prohibited residents from accessing affordable housing.",SKY News,lifestyle
'This operation will destroy critical habitat': Leonardo DiCaprio blasts Australian Government for approving West Australian bauxite mine expansion,Chloe Walker,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/celebrity-life/this-operation-will-destroy-critical-habitat-leonardo-dicaprio-blasts-australian-government-for-approving-west-australian-bauxite-mine-expansion/news-story/a37d41b3446ccada7953dffbf1abe7f9,"Hollywood star Leonardo DiCaprio has criticised the Australian Government for approving the expansion of a bauxite mine in Western Australia.
In February, Environment Minister Tanya Plibersek approved South32’s proposal to clear up to 3,855 hectares of native vegetation in WA’s Northern Jarrah Forests for its bauxite mine expansion near Boddington, south of Perth.
The Oscar-winning actor and environmental advocate voiced his opposition on social media on Wednesday, sharing footage of two rare red-tailed black cockatoos, a species unique to south-western Australia.
""The Australian government has approved deforestation within the Jarrah Forest of Western Australia, clearing the way for the mining of bauxite, the main ingredient in aluminium,"" DiCaprio captioned the clip.
""The mining company @south_32 is set to clear 9,600 acres of this old-growth forest, which is home to threatened species like the Critically Endangered Woylie.
""This operation will destroy critical habitat for over 8,000 species, 80% of which are found nowhere else on Earth.""
DiCaprio, who founded the environmental organisation Earth Alliance in 2019, highlighted that while Western Australia banned native forest logging last year, clearing forests for mining remains permitted due to ""separate government policies"" prioritising mining over conservation.
""This new approval is in addition to South32’s previous deforestation, bringing the total area of Jarrah Forests cleared to over 38,000 acres,"" he said.
""@rewild and @wild.ark stand to protect these towering ecosystems that are already at risk of climate collapse.""
His post quickly gained traction, racking up over a million likes on Facebook and 55,000 on Instagram (at time of writing).
""Thanks for standing up for the forests, and their flora and fauna Leo. Is our government listening?"" one user wrote on Facebook.
Another user said: ""Is he going to fly his luxury jet to Perth, and lecture us on carbon emissions???""
Late last month, protesters gathered outside South32’s Perth headquarters, demanding an end to mining expansion in the region.
Similar demonstrations took place outside Alcoa’s regional offices in Pinjarra, another bauxite mining company operating in the area.
Mereana Lewis, co-founder of Locals for Environmental Action and Protection (LEAP), told the ABC she felt ""betrayed"" by the federal government's approval of the South32 Worsley Alumina expansion.
""We are devastated, absolutely devastated,"" she said.
""We did put our trust in Minister Plibersek. We had so much information which we gave to the ministry, and we feel that no-one has taken any notice of our concern.""
Meanwhile, South32 chief executive Graham Kerr welcomed the approval, saying the expansion would create 200 additional jobs as mining operations extended into new areas around Boddington.
He argued the project was crucial to maintaining WA’s bauxite supply.
""If we didn't get these approval areas, we were essentially going to run out of bauxite,"" he said.
""That would've been a material impact on the South West.""
A spokesperson for the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water told SkyNews.com.au that the mine expansion was approved under the strict conditions of the national environment law.
These conditions include requiring South32 to progressively rehabilitate mined areas, protect active black cockatoo nest hollows, and ensure the viability of the Woylie and Numbat populations in and around the mine site.
It must also establish artificial nest hollows for three threatened species of Black Cockatoos, and implement a Water Management Plan to minimise the risk of adverse impacts on protected matters, specifically the Quindanning Spider Orchid and Carter’s Freshwater Mussel.
Furthermore, the mining company has been instructed to ""protect and enhance 12,345 hectares to compensate for the loss of 3,855 ha of native vegetation"" that provides habitat for threatened species (Jarrah-Marri (Corymbia calophylla) Forest and woodlands of Wandoo (Eucalyptus wandoo)-Marri).
It will contribute to a research program aimed at ""improving the management and protection of impacted species of national significance"" and ""enhancing habitat values to ultimately assist with maintenance of the ongoing ecological integrity"" of the Northern Jarrah Forest.
South32 expected to commence operations in the newly approved areas in the fourth quarter of the 2025 financial year.
A representative of the Perth-based mining company responded to DiCaprio's post, claiming it ""contains factual errors"".
""For example, our proposal does not include clearing of old growth forest, and the WA Environment Minister’s Ministerial Statement explicitly states that old growth forest is not to be disturbed by our proposal,"" the spokesperson told SkyNews.com.au.
""The Worsley Mine Development Project will be undertaken in accordance with strict approval conditions that seek to avoid or minimise impacts to habitats of species, including the Black Cockatoo, to support their ongoing viability.""
Since its original proposal, the spokesperson said South32 has ""significantly reduced the amount of native vegetation that will be cleared as part of the project"" to further avoid and minimise impacts to the environment.
They emphasised that within the areas that it received approval to mine, protected areas and buffer zones will be implemented around known habitats of certain protected species.
""...We will undertake (or have already undertaken) targeted flora and fauna surveys and monitoring as required by our approvals,"" the spokesperson said.
""In accordance with our approval conditions, we will progressively rehabilitate land we clear through our operations, helping to re-establish flora and fauna habitat.""
Additionally, the spokesperson stated that nearly 8,000 hectares of land will be ""set aside and restored"" to create more habitat for species including the Black Cockatoo, as part of its total 12,300 hectare offsets package.",SKY News,lifestyle
‘She'd called me’: Police change Gene Hackman's wife's death timeline after doctor's bombshell detail,Isabella Rayner,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/celebrity-life/shed-called-me-police-change-gene-hackmans-wifes-death-timeline-after-doctors-bombshell-detail/news-story/a8121c2c782d10a79138c24755b05f93,"Police have changed Hollywood actor Gene Hackman's wife's death timeline after a doctor declared she called his clinic 24 hours after police initially said she died.
Betsy Arakawa was found dead alongside her husband of 24 years inside their home in the US state of New Mexico late last month.
Dr Heather Jarrell from the New Mexico Medical Investigator's Office early this month said Hackman died from ""significant"" heart disease, with Alzheimer's also contributing to his death.
The exact time of death could not be determined, but Dr Jarrell said ""it is reasonable to assume"" he died when the actor's pacemaker stopped recording cardiac activity on February 18.
The medical examiner concluded Arakawa likely died on February 11, one week before her husband, by hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, a disease carried by rodents typically through their urine, droppings and saliva.
However, Dr Josiah Child, who runs Cloudberry Health in Santa Fe, New Mexico, this week said: ""Mrs Hackman didn't die on February 11 because she called my clinic on February 12.
""She'd called me a couple of weeks before her death to ask about getting an echocardiogram (heart scan) for her husband,"" Dr Child told The Mail on Sunday.
""She was not a patient of mine, but one of my patients recommended Cloudberry to her. She made an appointment for herself for February 12.
""It was for something unrelated to anything respiratory.""
Dr Child said Mrs Hackman cancelled her scheduled appointment two days before she was due to see him, saying her husband was not well.
The medical professional said she called back on February 12 and spoke to one of the doctors at Cloudberry.
The doctor asked her to come in that afternoon, but Dr Child said Mrs Hackman never attended the appointment, which was unrelated to hantavirus, and calls to her went unanswered.
He said it was curious she also did not appear to be in respiratory distress given her likely cause of death.
Hantavirus symptoms often start with fatigue, fever, and muscle aches, followed by headaches, dizziness, chills, and abdominal issues and if respiratory symptoms develop, the mortality rate is approximately 38 per cent, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
In a statement on Tuesday, Santa Fe County Sheriff’s Office told E! News the office did not report an explicit date of death and claimed phone records verify Dr Child’s account.
“We did state that the last known activity shown for Mrs Arakawa Hackman was on February 11, 2025. We also stated that the investigation was open and we were awaiting cell phone records. Pending cell phone records, the Santa Fe County Sheriff’s Office investigation showed the last known activity of Mrs Hackman to be February 11, 2025,” the statement to E! News read.
“We can now confirm that Mrs Hackman’s phone was utilised on the morning of February 12 to call a medical centre in Santa Fe, Cloudberry Health.
""A total of three calls were made that morning, all to the medical centre. One incoming call was made to Mrs Hackman from the same medical centre that afternoon which appeared as a missed call on Mrs Hackman’s cell phone. This information was learned through an investigation into the cell phone data contained on her phone.”
Santa Fe County Sheriff Adan Mendoza previously outlined Mrs Hackman's final days, saying on February 9 she had picked up one of her dogs - later found dead - which had undergone a procedure.
Then, two days later, she emailed her therapist, visited a market and was spotted on CCTV at a pharmacy and pet food shop.
According to an earlier affidavit, Arakawa was found inside the bathroom beside an orange prescription pill bottle with pills scattered across the floor.
Hackman was found on the ground near the kitchen.
Their dog died from dehydration and starvation, according to the report from the state Department of Agriculture’s veterinary lab.
The Australian kelpie mix was found dead in a crate in a bathroom closet near Arakawa's body, while the couple's two other dogs survived.",SKY News,lifestyle
'This twist ruined marriages': Married At First Sight insider reveals show's 'sickening' final task which 'ended' relationships on the spot,Isabella Rayner,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/celebrity-life/this-twist-ruined-marriages-married-at-first-sight-insider-reveals-shows-sickening-final-task-which-ended-relationships-on-the-spot/news-story/330422e5c82a0384aaf5e3f1735f3c26,"Married At First Sight is set to hit a new low this season when participants are forced to undergo a final brutal task which insiders describe as ""sickening"" and ""sadistic.""
It can be revealed the Nine Network's controversial TV megahit will introduce the controversial task - called 'Is the Grass Greener on the Other Side?' - in an upcoming episode.
The task will see participants presented with an envelope giving them with the option of remaining committed to their current on-screen spouse, or meeting an entirely new 'back-up' match hand-picked by the MAFS experts.
A production insider told Daily Mail Australia's Ali Daher on Thursday the task derailed most of the participants' marriages, with even the happiest couples strongly encouraged to pursue their new suitors.
""The participants were asked if they wanted to meet their backup… It was f***** up because even happy couples were strongly encouraged to explore their options,"" the insider said.
""This twist ruined marriages. Some couples ended things right then and there.""
The ""heartbreaking"" task got underway in the early morning hours, with participants separated and deciding to swap partners without first consulting their spouses or knowing what the other person would choose.
Grooms Paul Antoine, Adrian Araouzou, Ryan Donnelly and Teejay Halkias all surrendered to the challenge and met their new match.
However, Paul is said to have instantly regretted his decision, which his on-screen wife Carina Mirabile considered to be emotional cheating.
Brides Jamie Marinos, Awhina Rutene, Jacqueline Burfoot, and Beth Kelly all also agreed to meet their new suitor.
In a cruel twist, Jamie's new match stood her up during their first meeting, reportedly leaving her devastated and regretting her decision.
Jamie's on-screen husband Dave was one of the few who decided not to meet their back up match, as did Carina, Jeff Gobbels, and Rhi Disljenkovic.
The insider said that once the participants had made their choices, they had no idea what their spouses had decided, which rattled them and successfully brought the challenges' design to create chaos to fruition.
They said some of the brides and grooms said no without a second thought, most likely Jeff and Rhi, while others instantly regretted saying yes to meeting their backup match.
This suggests that some of the meetings didn't go as planned, with some participants likely failing to connect with their new matches.
MAFS expert John Aiken defended the task and said pushing people to realise whether they believed in their match was necessary.
Sexologist Alessandra Rampolla also backed it, saying difficult choices caused fascinating reactions.
She maintained the task wasn't about breaking the couples up but determining who was and wasn't willing to fight for one another.
However, the insider disagreed, saying the task proved the show had ""totally given up on this being about love stories.""",SKY News,lifestyle
Heartbreaking images of Bruce Willis emerge as ailing star celebrates 70th birthday with ex wife Demi Moore and family,Chloe Walker,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/celebrity-life/heartbreaking-images-of-bruce-willis-emerge-as-ailing-star-celebrates-70th-birthday-with-ex-wife-demi-moore-and-family/news-story/29176293684cd4623ad6485d98b62b63,"Bruce Willis' family has come together to celebrate his 70th birthday as the Hollywood legend continues to battle aphasia and frontotemporal dementia (FTD).
In a series of heartfelt social media posts, Willis' wife, Emma Heming Willis, and his three eldest daughters, Rumer, Scout, and Tallulah, whom he shares with ex-wife Demi Moore, shared touching images and videos in honour of the Die Hard star's milestone.
Moore, 62, posted a nostalgic montage of family photos, captioning it: ""Happy birthday, BW! We love you.""
One particularly moving image from the montage showed Willis resting on a pillow, with one of his daughters sitting tenderly by his side.
Willis stepped away from his decades-long acting career in 2022 after being diagnosed with aphasia, a brain disorder that affects communication.
The following year, his family revealed he had been diagnosed with FTD, a progressive condition for which there is no cure.
Despite the challenges, eldest daughter Rumer shared an uplifting update with fans on Instagram ahead of his birthday.
""He’s doing great, thank you for asking,"" she told a fan on her Instagram Stories.
""It's actually his 70th birthday tomorrow, so please wish my Papa a big happy birthday!""
Scout also paid tribute, posting a collection of images and videos of her father.
""Happy birthday to the Greatest of All Time,"" she wrote.
""Every day I thank the Gods that 50% of my DNA is from him. The music I make, the magic I create, and the magnetic mischief I incite- that's my father's legacy alive in the world.""
Tallulah shared her own emotional reflection on Willis' larger-than-life presence in Hollywood and his most cherished role, being a dad.
""Throughout my childhood, I was so frequently asked what it was like to have capital B Bruce Willis as a dad, that somehow these people thought that when they saw him jump off buildings via a 20ft screen he remained EXTRA LARGE,"" she wrote.
""He's a person, a man, a son, a kid from Jersey who hit the mother f***** jackpot of life by the stroke of luck he couldn't even explain.
“""For years, I would get red in the face when people found out my 'full' name. But I'm pretty damn proud to be Tallulah Belle Bruce Willis.""
Willis' wife and primary carer, Emma, also shared a cheerful photo of him giving a thumbs-up while sitting on a quad bike.
""It's Bruce's birthday, and if there's one thing I know, it's that there's no greater fan than a Bruce fan,"" the 46-year-old wrote.
""So flood him with all the love today- he will feel it, I swear he will. You are one powerful bunch. I love how you rally for him, and I'm so grateful that he has you.""
Emma and Willis, who married in 2009, share two daughters, Mabel and Evelyn.
In February, Emma revealed she is writing a book about her experience as a caregiver.
""This book is for caregivers- to remind them they are not alone- and for the people in their lives to learn how they can support them,” she said in an Instagram post on Sunday.
""The idea that caregiving is a solo mission is outdated. Caregiving is a societal responsibility.
""Dare I hope this book sparks a shift in how we, as a society, view and support caregivers.""",SKY News,lifestyle
"'Hi-ho, Hi-ho': Controversial actor Kevin Spacey jokes about replacing Rachel Zegler in Disney's 'woke' Snow White remake",Chloe Walker,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/celebrity-life/hiho-hiho-controversial-actor-kevin-spacey-jokes-about-replacing-rachel-zegler-in-disneys-woke-snow-white-remake/news-story/f4c9fe2f0087268072a2ec603eef6222,"Kevin Spacey has humorously suggested he could replace Rachel Zegler in Disney's latest Snow White remake.
The 65-year-old actor, who has faced challenges in securing roles following multiple sexual misconduct allegations, took to X on Wednesday to jest about the film, which has been embroiled in controversy.
He reshared a post from the satirical news site The Babylon Bee, which read: ""Disney wondering if it's too late to replace Rachel Zegler with Kevin Spacey.""
Adding his own spin, Spacey wrote: ""Hi-Ho, Hi-Ho, it's off to work I go…"" a reference to the famous song sung by Snow White's seven dwarfs.
Since its announcement in 2019, Disney's $269.4 million live adaption of Snow White remake has become a lightning rod for cultural debate.
The backlash began with the casting of Zegler, who has been outspoken on social media and dismissed the original 1937 film's love story as outdated.
""It's no longer 1937,"" the 23-year-old actress said, arguing that Prince Charming ""literally stalks her"" in the original film.
""She’s not going to be saved by the prince, and she’s not going to be dreaming about true love. She’s dreaming about becoming the leader she knows she can be.""
Hi-Ho, Hi-Ho, it's off to work I go... https://t.co/UflAjjOliu
The film has also faced criticism for its depiction of the Seven Dwarfs, opting for a diverse group of ""magical creatures"" of varying heights, races, and genders, leading to accusations of excessive political correctness.
Director Marc Webb addressed these changes in Disney's official production notes, stating, ""I think all good stories evolve over time. They become reflections of the world that we live in.""
Most recently, the film has been caught in further controversy due to political views expressed by both Zegler, who has been criticised for pro-Palestinian comments, and Gal Gadot, who plays the Evil Queen and is a vocal supporter of Israel.
Despite the months of debate, Snow White quietly premiered at the Los Angeles El Capitan Theatre on Saturday, earning mixed reviews from critics.
Meanwhile, Spacey is no stranger to controversy himself.
Recently, Australian actor Guy Pearce revealed feeling ""scared"" of him during their collaboration on the 1997 film L.A. Confidential.
Pearce mentioned he felt safer when fellow Aussie Simon Baker was present, as Spacey seemed more focused on Baker.
In response, Spacey addressed Pearce's comments in a video on X, questioning the timing of the revelations and advising Pearce to ""grow up"".
The Oscar winner's career faced a significant downturn following sexual assault allegations that surfaced in 2017, beginning with actor Anthony Rapp's claims of advances in the 1980s.
Subsequent accusations led to his swift fall from grace.
In 2023, he was acquitted of charges related to his tenure at London's Old Vic Theatre but now faces a civil lawsuit which was filed in London's High Court on February 12.
The Babylon Bee's satirical piece jested about replacing Zegler with Spacey, humorously suggesting Disney is ""running damage control"" and considering ""a less-hated actor""  like Spacey.
It also poked fun at former working royal Meghan Markle, adding: ""At publishing time, Meghan Markle had also been confirmed as a possible replacement for Zegler.""
Fans reacted to Spacey's post by sharing AI-generated images of him as Snow White.
One commented, ""It could work!"" while another said: ""My Spacey, you're awesome. It's a disgrace the way you’ve been treated. You deserve a formidable comeback! Praying for you!""

The 75-year-old music legend stepped out on Tuesday to celebrate his wife Jillian's milestone birthday at Melbourne's renowned Italian restaurant, Grossi Florentino.
Smiling alongside Jillian, his wife of 50 years, Farnham posed for a family photo that also featured sons Robert and James, along with their partners Melissa and Tessa, who recently announced she is expecting a baby boy.
The image, shared on Instagram by Robert, was captioned: ""Happy birthday 70th to mum! Love u x.""
Robert, 45, also posted several videos on his Instagram Stories, capturing Farnham enjoying dinner and conversation with loved ones at the gathering.
As the meal wrapped up, the family watched a montage of Jillian's life, accompanied by Farnham's song 'Jillie's Song'.
The mother-of-two beamed as she sat beside Farnham, surrounded by family and friends reminiscing about cherished moments.
The past few years have been challenging for the Farnham family, following the Australian singer's cancer diagnosis in August 2022.
Farnham underwent a gruelling 11-and-a-half-hour surgery in Melbourne to remove a tumour from his mouth, followed by eight weeks of radiation therapy.
At the same time, son James, 36, faced his own health battle, undergoing major surgery for diverticular disease after complications led to perforations in his bowel.
The operation saved his life but left him with a stoma, which he hopes to have reversed soon.
Reflecting on the experience, James shared an emotional message on Instagram in January 2024.
""Last year, just as Dad was recovering from his cancer surgeries, I also had major surgery,"" he wrote.
""Coming off the back of what felt like a torturous period that left us emotionally exhausted. It was one thing after another, and when I noticed something felt wrong I kept ignoring it.""
He expressed gratitude to his medical team at Cabrini Malvern Hospital in Melbourne, as well as his family and partner, Tessa.
""I also wouldn’t have been able to do any of the last six months without my family’s help and especially my partner Tessa. You really are my heart and soul boo and I love you so much.""
Last week, James appeared on Sunrise to provide an update on his father's health.
""He's doing great, he's doing really well, walking around, kicking goals … annoying mum,"" he said.
After what he described as a ""tough time"", James said the family was looking forward to welcoming ""another little Farnham"".
""Mum and Dad are both super pumped, they'll be a great nan and pop for sure.""
Since the You're The Voice singer's diagnosis, the Farnham family has been actively involved in supporting cancer charities.
In 2024, Robert and James became Daffodil Day ambassadors for the Cancer Council and regularly promote events such as Cancer Research Giving Day to help raise awareness and funds for cancer research.",SKY News,lifestyle
Mysterious Netflix crew member defends 'really lovely' Meghan Markle after Vanity Fair bullying claims,Reilly Sullivan,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/celebrity-life/mysterious-netflix-crew-member-defends-really-lovely-meghan-markle-after-vanity-fair-bullying-claims/news-story/18fd844cb5652d6668ca54ccf56c80f4,"Meghan Markle’s camp has hit back at oft-repeated bullying claims with a glowing endorsement from an unnamed staffer on the Duchess’s new Netflix program.
Markle, 43, has faced unsubstantiated claims of alleged unprofessionalism in the workplace stemming back to her brief stint as a working royal in 2018.
Most recently, fresh bullying claims were made in January after Hollywood bible Vanity Fair published an 8,000-word take down on the Sussexes’ fractured business relationships.
The cover feature, titled “American Hustle”, included allegations that the Duchess of Sussex mistreated staff and characterised the Duke of Sussex as largely well-meaning but dangerously dim witted.
One former staffer told Vanity Fair that Markle would start out “effusive” in praising her team but eventually became “cold and withholding” when something went poorly.
The source also alleged that the environment around the Sussexes was “really awful” and “painful”, describing some of the behaviour as like “Mean Girls”.
Bizarrely, sources who worked with the Sussexes claimed the former working royals still insist on being addressed as “sir or ma’am” despite no longer officially working as part of the royal family.
On Friday, a Netflix “crew member” involved with the production of 'With Love, Meghan' praised the Duchess of Sussex’s workplace conduct during an interview with People magazine.
The crew member who worked on the show, which is filmed in a rented home down the street from Markle’s real home, claimed the Duchess of Sussex was generous and kind to all staff.
The source also provided remarkable detail about Markle’s generosity, noting that the ex-working royal bought each staffer a sauté-style fry pan from the brand ‘Our Place’, which retails for about $160 AUD, as well as a handwritten monogrammed spoon that read, ""Thank you, crew"".
""In this show, we were part of it, we were included, it was a very unique and refreshing experience,” the source said.
“Meghan made us feel seen.”
The source also revealed other specific examples of Meghan’s generosity, including the time Markle paid for a coffee cart to pull up outside the rental home during production.
“Whether it was a coffee cart in the morning or there was one day where the forecast called for it to be particularly hot, and she had a shaved ice truck for us at lunch,” the source said.
""One day, she had a bespoke ice cream cart with local homemade ice cream.
“She had an acai truck for us, too. Every week, she did something like that for us. It was really lovely.""",SKY News,lifestyle
US judge sets release deadline for Prince Harry’s visa documents after claims the royal lied about drug use on application,Laurence Karacsony,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/celebrity-life/us-judge-sets-release-deadline-for-prince-harrys-visa-documents-after-claims-the-royal-lied-about-drug-use-on-applicati/news-story/0cd39e114ae6f06f029efc34786baf8a,"A US judge has set an imminent deadline for the release of Prince Harry's visa file after the royal was accused of lying on his immigration forms about his drug use.
Judge Carl Nichols, appointed by President Donald Trump, ruled the prince's visa file must be released by Tuesday at the latest, however, aspects of the documents will remain redacted.
The judge, who sits in Washington, approved of censoring certain parts of the document by the Department of Homeland Security, describing the changes as ""appropriate"", according to the Daily Mail.
It is unclear what will be redacted, however, lawyers for DHS have previously said three items will be released with some redactions while a fourth document will remain out of the public eye.
Last month it was revealed Prince Harry's visa documents would be released after the DHS agreed to publicise the redacted version of the forms after a year-long court battle.
In May 2023, the conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation sued the DHS to release the visa documents under the Freedom of Information Act, after claiming Harry may have received favourable treatment when applying for his residency visa.
The group believed the Duke of Sussex may have lied on his immigration forms about his past drug use as admission to using illicit substances can disqualify applicants from entering the United States or acquiring residence.
Harry has previously admitted to using a long list of illicit substances in his memoir Spare, including marijuana, cocaine and psychedelic mushrooms.
The DHS previously refused the Freedom of Information request for Harry's files on privacy grounds.
""The public does not have a strong interest in disclosure of the Duke’s immigration records,"" Judge Carl Nichols said at the time.
""Like any foreign national, the Duke has a legitimate privacy interest in his immigration status.""
Trump has ruled out deporting King Charles’ younger son despite flirting with the idea of expelling the ex-working royal during his presidential campaign.

Married At First Sight viewers hit out at Ryan for ‘disgusting’ stay-at-home dad remark after Jacqui challenged 'warrior' groom,Isabella Rayner,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/celebrity-life/married-at-first-sight-viewers-hit-out-at-ryan-for-disgusting-stayathome-dad-remark-after-jacqui-challenged-warrior-groom/news-story/765314d952be7310d3a8356e11d3fa1b,"Married At First Sight viewers have taken aim at groom Ryan Donnelly after he called the mere suggestion he could ever be a stay-at-home dad ""insulting"".
On Tuesday evening's episode, the 36-year-old project manager rejected the idea of becoming a full-time dad, calling the notion ""ridiculous.""
His comments were in response to his on-screen wife Jacqui Burfoot's concerns Ryan's ""sensitive pride and ego"" would cause a rift if their future family operated unconventionally.
""I'm concerned that I will be the primary breadwinner, putting you in a place where you don't want to be, where you might be the primary caregiver,"" she told Ryan.
""Theoretically, if it came to it, would you be a stay-at-home dad?""
Ryan snapped back: ""Being a stay-at-home dad is not what I am going to do with my life.
""You know very well what I want to do with my life, and you know that a stay-at-home dad is the most ridiculous thing. I can't believe we're having this conversation,"" he said.
""I will never be a stay-at-home dad. It's insulting to think that you would think I would even consider that.""
Ryan, who calls himself a ""warrior,"" then spoke to the camera, expressing concern Jacqui would next ask him to be her ""trophy husband.""
""'Would you be a stay-at-home Dad?' What's next? 'Oh Ryan, how would you feel about being a trophy husband?' Jesus,"" he said.
Shocked viewers took to social media to criticise Ryan for what they dubbed 'toxic masculinity'.
One person said his comments were ""everything wrong with the state of masculinity today.""
""His comments about being a stay-at-home dad were disgusting. What total disrespect for women in general,"" another person said.
""The part about refusing to be a stay-at-home dad even if you’re in a coma was wild…so many (red flags),"" a third wrote.
""Oh, good, Ryan showing all the women of Australia that he would be a s*** husband and a s*** father,"" one more added.
Another viewer said they were ""sure all the stay-at-home dads enjoyed you putting them down, Ryan.""
It comes as Jacqui, a consultant from NSW, has frequently said Ryan does not ""show up"" for her in the way she thinks a husband should.
Jacqui has criticised him for not buying her flowers, refusing to take his shoes off the bed and not being more attentive, reading these desires out to him in list form.
This week's couple swap challenge saw Jacqui paired with groom Jeff Gobbels for a night before she requested a late checkout from 'Hotel Jeff' after he steamed her dress and cooked for her.
""It's what I wished for going into this experiment; it's what I would have hoped for, and I would have expected my husband to show up for me in this way,"" she said.",SKY News,lifestyle
'There are so many opportunities now to travel': Princess Catherine teases possible Australian royal tour,Reilly Sullivan,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/celebrity-life/there-are-so-many-opportunities-now-to-travel-princess-catherine-teases-possible-australian-royal-tour/news-story/4f72ca97b97dba739cfa29fe974fffa4,"Princess Catherine has given a major update about a possible Australian royal tour with the Prince of Wales after marking St Patrick's Day for the first time since completing cancer treatment.
The Princess of Wales attended a St Patrick's Day parade in London on Monday after missing last year’s event due to her cancer diagnosis.
Kate donned a festive green coat dress by Alexander McQueen to mark St Patrick’s Day at Wellington Barracks, where she was seen chatting to Aussie reservist Corporal Adam Hamilton.
According to The Telegraph newspaper, Princess Catherine told the corporal of her plans to one day bring Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis to Australia.
“It’s finding time to do that,” she said of a possible Australia visit by the Wales family.
“But I love to travel – yes, it’s a long flight … There are so many opportunities now to travel, I think it’s brilliant to experience it.
“We tend to go further afield when it’s official visits – it’s being able to carve out time to experience these countries in a more private capacity.
“Because otherwise you end up seeing lots of insides of amazing buildings but you don’t get to meet that many people.
“It’s making sure that you can combine a bit of work with the children.”
The 43-year-old Princess reportedly ended the friendly chat by teasing Corporal Hamilton that she might “see you down there”.
The last time the Princess of Wales visited Australia was in April 2014 for a 10-day tour with William and a then-baby Prince George.
Catherine, who was then known as Duchess of Cambridge, squeezed in stops in Sydney, Brisbane, Canberra, Uluru and Adelaide during the visit.
Last October, King Charles III and Queen Camilla arrived in Australia for a five day royal visit before travelling to Samoa for the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting.
All up, Charles and Camilla’s visit ending up costing Australians $640,060.47, which included expenses such as accommodation and meals, ground transport and a charitable donation to Greening Australia on behalf of the King.
A spokesman for the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet told SkyNews.com.au that the 2024 tour cost “significantly less” than previous tours by Queen Elizabeth II.
By comparison, a previous five-day tour by the late Queen Elizabeth II under the Howard government, which included stops in Sydney, Canberra and Melbourne for the 2006 Commonwealth Games, totalled $1,450,239.",SKY News,lifestyle
Married At First Sight homestays fraud exposed as Jacqui Burfoot's apartment is revealed to be Airbnb 'booked for one night',Isabella Rayner,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/celebrity-life/married-at-first-sight-homestays-fraud-exposed-as-jacqui-burfoots-apartment-is-revealed-to-be-airbnb-booked-for-one-night/news-story/c594d9c0796c14d56831e1f4f469df0c,"A Married At First Sight groom has made the bombshell claim his bride's ""home"" depicted on-air during the ""homestays week"" portion of the series was actually a rented Airbnb.
Ryan Donnelly, 36, took to social media on Tuesday to allege the Manly apartment occupied by his ""wife"" Jacqui Burfoot, 29, was in fact accommodation rented for a single night.
""This wasn't Jacqui's home,"" began Ryan's post on his Instagram Stories, which was accompanied by an image of the couple entering what the show claimed was the jewellery store owner's ""kingdom"".
""It was an Airbnb booked for the one night we filmed in Manly,"" added the project manager.
""Her actual place was a rental apartment with two other housemates,"" Ryan continued, explaining that Jacqui's actual home was ""tiny"" and unable to fit the camera crew inside.
The cost of the Airbnb was $200-a-night, according to Daily Mail Australia.
Homestay week is purportedly designed to give participants a glimpse into how their lives might look with their ""spouse"" outside the experiment.
The deceit comes just one week after Jacqui exclusively revealed to SkyNews.com.au she is ""unable to work"" as a lawyer in the wake of her depiction on the show.
Jacqui claimed she had not worked as a lawyer at a high-end firm in NSW since the show aired in January, alleging her edit affected her capacity to perform.
Jacqui has been accused by viewers of being a ""golddigger"" and ""loopy"", with fans lambasting her for ""fake crying"" about seemingly mundane details such as having a television in the couple's bedroom.
""I essentially left my job after I tried to go back to work because I was mentally distressed and couldn't work,"" she said on Wednesday.
""I've been unable to continue my career... I've been left to fend on my own, basically,"" added the reality TV star.
""I wasn't medically capable of performing my duties because I was under so much mental distress and trauma.""
Jacqui is believed to be currently in a relationship with groom Clint Rice and living at his home in Tasmania after reportedly relocating to the island state from Sydney after production wrapped in December.

'Look what Woolies have': Woolworths launches limited edition Anya Hindmarch 'shopping bag' for $20,Reilly Sullivan,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/celebrity-life/look-what-woolies-have-woolworths-launches-limited-edition-anya-hindmarch-shopping-bag-for-20/news-story/d6df0947efdb8ac3c23acbda809d7232,"An eco-friendly reusable shopping bag from renowned British designer Anya Hindmarch will be sold at Woolworths for the bargain price of just $20.
The legendary designer, who recently became Dame Anya Hindmarch for her services to fashion and the environment, collaborated with the Aussie supermarket chain to design The Universal Bag.
The simple tote bag comes in Woolworths’ signature green and is designed to serve as a more durable alternative to the current 99 cent reusable bags available at the checkouts.
""The idea is to encourage people to give them a bag they want to reuse,"" Hindmarch revealed during an interview with the Today show on Tuesday.
Woolies has a new shopping bag $20 🛍️@Woolworths_au  The first bag made from 100% recycled plastics. I’m excited 👏👏👏 #Recycled #Shoppingbag #Woolies #New #Warranty #Bag #Reuseable #Ecofriendly #AnyaHindmarch #AvailableNow #Chic #Fashionable
“Other reusable supermarket bags are not the answer because they’re not nice enough.
“They fall apart, they end up in landfill themselves.”
Hindmarch launched her namesake handbag business in London in 1987 and her regular handbags can cost up to an eye-watering $4,000.
However, the English designer has been a pioneer of designing for the masses after launching her first reusable shopping bag back in 2007 in the United Kingdom for just £5 ($10.17) to raise awareness about plastic waste.
""The project actually led to a tax and charges for plastic bags in the UK so it actually changed the law which was wonderful,"" Hindmarch said.
""And it was just a better alternative to a bag for life,"" she added.
The original “I’m Not A Plastic Bag” campaign in 2007 has since evolved into her Universal Bag project, with Hindmarch partnering with supermarket chains across the globe on reusable shopping bags.
The Woolworths bag is set to launch in 600 supermarkets nationwide on Wednesday and comes as both major supermarket giants explore new ways to woo shoppers.
Last year, rival chain Coles launched a seven-piece stainless steel knife block set from high-end brand Smeg.
On TikTok, user @AllyLikesShopping revealed she had already found the designer bag for sale in her local Woolworths ahead of Wednesday's roll out.
""Look what Woolies have,"" she said in the clip.
""It's twenty dollars, but it’s guaranteed for 10 years, and it’s the first reusable bag that is made from 100 per cent recycled plastic.""",SKY News,lifestyle

On Friday, the 34-year-old posted images of several ""incredible"" artworks she had recently encountered.
""Extremely grateful to have been around some incredible art recently,"" she captioned a montage showcasing various pieces.
Eugenie also gave followers a closer look at the Paris Noir exhibition at the Centre Pompidou, sharing images and videos on her Instagram Stories.
""Incredible pieces of art,"" she wrote.
Her post quickly attracted attention, with fans leaving enthusiastic messages in the comments.
""The artwork is beautiful and unique! Thank you for showing the beautiful pictures, dear Princess Eugenie!!!"" one admirer wrote.
""Beautiful curational choices,"" another added, while a third commented: ""Remarkable and unique pieces!! Not sure I can pick a favourite! Thank you for sharing them.""
As the second daughter of Prince Andrew and Sarah, Duchess of York, Eugenie has long been passionate about the arts.
She earned a Combined Honours BA in English Literature, History of Art, and Politics from Newcastle University in 2012, and during her studies, interned at Christie’s London, where her second cousin, David Armstrong-Jones, Viscount Linley, was chairman, as well as at the Royal Collection at Buckingham Palace.
Eugenie later followed her passion to New York, working as a specialist at online auction house Paddle8 for two years before returning to London to take up a role as an associate director at Hauser & Wirth.
""I've loved art since I was very little,"" she told Harper’s Bazaar in 2016.
""I knew I definitely wouldn’t be a painter (laughs), but I knew this was the industry for me. I love being able to share my passion for art with people.""
She explained that her role involves ""planning special projects,"" ""supporting the artists in the gallery,"" and ""managing events.""
""I work with colleagues in London as well as our galleries in L.A., New York, Somerset in the U.K., and Zurich,"" she added.
After just one year in the role, Eugenie was promoted to director, a position she has now held full-time for more than eight years.
In  December, Eugenie took to Instagram to express her intention to share ""more of that part of my world with you"", referring to her deep involvement in the art scene.
Despite being 12th in line to the British throne, neither Eugenie nor her elder sister, Princess Beatrice, 36, are working royals, meaning they do not receive public funding for their activities or security.
However, both women remain active philanthropists and serve as patrons of various charities.
Eugenie's LinkedIn profile, where she uses the surname 'York', lists her as the co-founder of The Anti-Slavery Collective, an organisation she has been involved with full-time for seven years.
Meanwhile, her husband, Jack Brooksbank, 38, whom she met at Newcastle University, holds a marketing position at Discovery Land Company, a luxury real estate development firm owned by Mike Meldman.
In May 2022, reports emerged that Jack and Eugenie, along with their eldest son, August, would be splitting their time between the UK and Portugal due to Jack's work commitments.
Meldman was previously a partner in the George Clooney-founded Casamigos tequila brand, for which Jack had served as a brand ambassador for several years.
Although updates on their bi-national living arrangement have been sparse, the couple have since welcomed a second son, Ernest, and currently reside at Ivy Cottage on the grounds of Kensington Palace.
Jack has long expressed an interest in hospitality, telling the Daily Mail in 2013: ""I want to create a chain of pubs.
""It has been my dream since I was 18. I have fond memories of Sunday roasts in pubs with log fires, and it's something I want to recreate.""
Despite being considered a ""commoner"", Jack has aristocratic ties, descending from the Brooksbank baronets, according to The Telegraph.",SKY News,lifestyle
Eddie McGuire reveals who he would pick to take over hosting duties on revival of 'Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?',Chloe Walker,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/celebrity-life/eddie-mcguire-reveals-who-he-would-pick-to-take-over-hosting-duties-on-revival-of-who-wants-to-be-a-millionaire/news-story/42043a1fb22a42f963eb2dc5201f504c,"Media mogul Eddie McGuire has weighed in on the potential revival of 'Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?', saying he hopes an Australian comedian will take the reins.
McGuire, 60, has been a fixture on Australian television for more than two decades, hosting the local version of the globally popular quiz show from its debut on April 18, 1999, until it went on ""hiatus"" in January 2024.
Speaking to the Herald Sun on Friday, the former Collingwood Football Club president and ex-Nine CEO said he wasn't surprised to hear reports that the iconic format will return on Network 10.
He also floated an unexpected name for the hosting role.
""I always said it was a hiatus, not the end,"" McGuire said.
""It’s one of the most successful television shows around the world and spawned an Academy Award-winning movie. It's such a joyous show and to me it was only a matter of time.
""I just hope if it comes back it’s done well. It might be Sam Pang hosting, who knows.""
McGuire, who now runs production company JAM TV, noted that his own appointment as Millionaire host was considered a ""surprise choice"" at the time.
""It's not a quiz show and the host gets to play around, so I hope whoever gets it will have great fun,"" he said.
The father-of-two has long expressed confidence that the show would return after its ""hiatus"" was announced in August 2023.
""Shows sometimes become victims of their own success and their longevity,” he told the Sydney Morning Herald at the time.
""I sat down and said hello to people on the show and made them feel good over 15,500 times. Each of those people had their moment on TV, and some of them took home some money.
""It'll come back. It’s too good a format not to.""
At its peak, 'Who Wants to be a Millionaire?' pulled in over two million viewers and was among Australia’s top-rated programs.
The format's spin-off, 'Millionaire Hot Seat', premiered in 2009, with McGuire continuing as host until last year.
If Pang, 51, does take on the role, he'll have plenty on his plate- his new show 'Sam Pang Tonight' launched this week on Network 10 and 10Play.
The eight-episode series premiered on Monday at 8:40 pm, drawing mixed reviews and prompting comparisons to former network star Rove McManus' 'Rove Live' and 'Saturday Night Rove'.

'Confuses people': Meghan Markle's infamous pretzel bags lampooned on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,Reilly Sullivan,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/celebrity-life/confuses-people-meghan-markles-infamous-pretzel-bags-lampooned-on-the-tonight-show-starring-jimmy-fallon/news-story/144ecb6a17773b76808bc5e7bec8e52e,"Meghan Markle has been cruelly mocked on the Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon after the late night host lampooned the Duchess of Sussex’s new Netflix show.
Markle’s series, ‘With Love, Meghan’, debuted on the streaming giant earlier this month to soft critical reviews but strong enough viewing figures to be instantly “renewed” for a second season.
The program features Markle, who has no professional culinary background, inviting famous friends over to share cooking and homemaking tips.
On Wednesday night’s episode of his popular show, Fallon joked about Meghan, 43, making her own pretzel bags during an episode of her series while talking to his “sidekick” Steve Higgins.
Speaking to Jimmy, Steve said: ""Ready, you're going to get this. What is the number one question that mystifies scientists? Number one question.""
Jimmy then suggested: ""Is there life on another planet?,"" before Steve said, ""Ooh, no. Why does Meghan Markle make her own pretzel bags? They don't know why.""
""That's interesting,” Fallon replied without missing a beat, as the audience erupted into laughter.
“She takes it from one bag and puts it in another bag, and that confuses people.""
The comment appeared to mock a viral scene in With Love, Meghan where Markle is seen transferring pre-packaged pretzels into another bag with a personalised label on them.
The late night joke came days after Hollywood actress Justine Bateman lampooned Markle as “playacting at a job” on her Netflix cooking show.
“No one wants to watch someone playact at something they didn’t earn,” Bateman wrote via her Race Track Substack blog.
Meanwhile, some royal watchers have claimed the Duchess of Sussex may have “faked” a recent St Patrick's day-themed breakfast she shared via Instagram.
Markle filmed herself whipping up a bright green mixture, before pouring it into a steaming hot black cast-iron waffle maker with the caption “love a theme!”.
However, eagle-eyed viewers have alleged the finish result appeared to be “store bought” waffles that did not match the cast-iron print of Markle’s waffle maker.",SKY News,lifestyle
'Frankly it's pathetic': Stars of The Project blast 'wombat girl' Samantha Strable after she cancels interview and spreads 'misinformation' about Australia,Chloe Walker,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/celebrity-life/frankly-its-pathetic-stars-of-the-project-blast-wombat-girl-samantha-strable-after-she-cancels-interview-and-spreads-misinformation-about-australia/news-story/f8e8f27ccbe3429dc781454a48dce10e,"Channel 10's The Project has lashed out at the woman at the centre of the wombat controversy after she abruptly cancelled her scheduled on-air appearance.
Samantha Strable, also known as Sam Jones, sparked outrage after filming herself snatching a baby wombat from its mother on the side of a remote Australian road.
On Sunday, The Project aired an exclusive video from the hunting influencer in which she attempted to explain her actions.
""It was an incredible mistake, and there hasn’t been a moment I haven’t regretted it,"" she said.
""The same Government that is calling for my head is the one that spends millions of your tax dollars to mass slaughter native Australian animals.""
After the clip aired, host Hamish Macdonald told viewers the program had been set to interview Strable, but she pulled out at the last minute.
""We were all here earlier this afternoon to do an interview with her and ask her questions. She pulled out of that and instead provided that video,"" he revealed.
""I think, frankly, it's pathetic, given what's happened.""
While Macdonald made it clear he did not condone threats or violence against Strable, he criticised her decision to cancel.
""To say that you’re genuinely sorry, yet not be willing to explain yourself and then point the finger at the Australian Government, I think is pretty lousy,"" he said.
Co-hosts Sarah Harris and Sam Taunton agreed, with Taunton adding: ""She picked up the wombat, she was laughing.""
Harris said Strable's apology was particularly infuriating because of her claims about wombats being slaughtered in Australia.
""We know that wombats are protected here… You can get a penalty of up to $40,000 plus two years in prison if you hurt a wombat,"" Harris said.
Macdonald added that Strable's statement was ""riddled with misinformation"".
""But this is typical of influencers that only want to make their own statements to the world- no responsibility or accountability,"" he said.
""The reality is there has been a strong public response because I think Australians are proud of their wildlife and the incredible nature that we have.
""I think this individual has heard ‘loudly and clearly’ from the Australian public.""
Senior government sources confirmed that Strable left Australia voluntarily on Friday morning after the Immigration Department began reviewing her visa.
The following day, she issued a 900-word statement on Instagram, apologising but insisting she is not a ""villain"".
Instead, she accused Australians of hypocrisy, claiming the federal government ""allows and permits the slaughter of wombats"" and ""that thousands each year are shot, poisoned to suffer and trapped legally"".
""Let me be clear. These same people ought to understand the reality of Australia today,"" she said.
""For the readers that are so angered by my mistaken attempt to help and that I am a hunter- do not be blind to your country.""
The self-proclaimed ""environmental scientist"" also claimed the government kills wombats to ""feed"" Australians.
""I implore you to take a good, hard look at what is currently being done in Australia surrounding the real issues it faces, the lack of power for tens of thousands of Aussies, and the treatment of its native wildlife.""
Later, Strable responded to The Project's criticism via Instagram stories.
""DON’T BELIEVE ME ABOUT THE RAMPANT LEGAL SLAUGHTER OF NATIVE AND NON-NATIVE ANIMALS @theprojecttv?” she wrote over a screenshot of an X profile.
""Thousands of wombats are LEGALLY killed across Australia each year. That does NOT make my actions right, but you deserve to know.""

The 43-year-old professional golfer and his on-screen wife Lauren Hall, 37, dramatically walked out of a Commitment Ceremony and quit Nine's controversial dating show some weeks ago.
The pair said they were ""interested"" in seeing if they could work out outside of the experiment, however Clint has now moved on with Jacqui.
Pictures of the couple published by Woman's Day last week show them appearing loved up on a walk in Tasmania.
The 29-year-old former lawyer reportedly relocated from Sydney to Clint's home state after filming wrapped at the end of last year.
It's understood the couple is living in Clint's home near Launceston while Jacqui's relationship with groom Ryan Donnelly continues to air.
Speaking to Daily Mail Australia on Sunday, Clint said he personally told Ryan he was dating Jacqui - and received a very odd reaction from his love rival.
""Ryan tried to spin it as though we were mates – but we weren't,"" said Clint.
""We didn't know each other before the show, and we won't know each other after.""

Clint poured cold water over his girlfriend's extremely negative portrayal on the show.
""She put everything on the line to make [their relationship] work. I'm so glad she did. Jacqui is nothing like what they are showing,"" he said.
""It's a hard watch. It's tough seeing some of the cast on there and knowing who they really are versus what's being shown. And Jacqui is copping it the worst.
""She's smart, successful, and a great role model for young women – but they're painting her as some kind of villain. It's disgusting.""

The new series, a spin-off from the hugely successful The Bachelor and The Bachelorette franchise, will be hosted by popular television presenter Samantha Armytage.
Barry 'Bear' Myrden, a 50-something-year-old widower from Manly, is set to embark on a televised search for love, according to Daily Mail Australia.
On Wednesday, Myrden was spotted looking suave in a black tuxedo as he cruised across Sydney Harbour in a retro Italian speedboat during filming.
Hailing from Corner Brook, Newfoundland, Canada, Myrden attended Regina High School before earning degrees in industrial engineering and petroleum engineering at the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology.
After relocating to Australia in the early 2000s, the father of three began working as a data centre manager at RTA before moving on to roles at IBM Global Business Services, Macquarie Group, and the Port Authority of New South Wales.
Since 2023, he has worked as an infrastructure engineer in data centre management at Woolworths Group.
Myrden tragically lost his wife, Audrey, to a rare brain cancer in 2011.
Despite this heartbreak, he has embraced life, regularly sharing photos on social media with his now grown-up sons, enjoying sailing, working out, and playing rugby with friends.
""Life should not be a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely, in an attractive and well-preserved body, but rather to skid in sideways, totally worn out, shouting 'WOO-HOO! What a ride!'"" he previously wrote in a Facebook post.
Unlike the typically younger contestants of The Bachelor and The Bachelorette, Myrden's journey is expected to resonate with a mature audience, those who have loved, lost, and are seeking companionship in their next chapter.
""Bear is not your usual reality TV type,"" an insider told Daily Mail Australia.
""He's charming, intelligent, and has really lived a full life. He's been through love, loss, and now he's ready to open his heart again. Women are going to adore him.""
A friend of Myrden suggested his sons may have encouraged him to join the show.
""Bear is always complaining that his boys tell him he's bringing around the wrong type of girls—too young and too hot for him,"" they said.
While The Bachelor and The Bachelorette are Channel 10 productions, The Golden Bachelor is set to air on the Nine Network in the coming months.
Armytage, who moved from Channel Seven to Nine in October last year, said she loves the idea of the new series after stepping away from Farmer Wants a Wife.
Around the same time, the 48-year-old announced her ""amicable"" split from husband of five years, Richard Lavender.
""This is for people who are looking for love again. I kind of love that- these are people with life experience, and it's totally fascinating,"" Armytage said in a December interview on Today.

Twist as Gene Hackman's family files to block his and wife Betsy Arakawa’s autopsy results after mysterious deaths,Gemma Crotty,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/celebrity-life/twist-as-gene-hackmans-family-files-to-block-his-and-wife-betsy-arakawas-autopsy-results-after-mysterious-deaths/news-story/6f8a4e1b46a09740b52291e69c833002,"Gene Hackman’s family has filed to block the release of his and wife Betsy Arakawa’s autopsy results and investigation details after the pair was found dead at their New Mexico home last month.
The Oscar-winning actor, 95, and Arakawa, a classic pianist, 65, were found dead at their Santa Fe home on February 26, along with one of their dogs.
Hackman is said to have died from ""significant"" heart disease, with Alzheimer's also contributing to his death, while Arakawa is believed to have succumbed to hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, according to a medical examiner.
However, in startling new revelations, Hackman’s family has filed to block the release of the couple’s autopsy and investigation results following a weeks-long investigation by police.
Sources have labelled the move “very atypical”, with one insider familiar with the matter telling The Sun it was “not something I have ever seen before”.
“New Mexico doesn’t have an exemption for autopsy photos, and normally it’s not a concern, but when it comes to celebrity deaths, a lot of people will request them,” the source said.
“So it’s common where family members of celebrities would use the New Mexico courts to block release of photos specifically.”
It followed a New Mexico judge earlier ruling photos showing the mummified bodies of the reclusive couple would be blocked from public view after the family requested a restraining order on their release.
The family also argued the 14th Amendment gave them the right to grieve without the post-mortem photos being made accessible to the public.
In further revelations, Hackman’s daughter Elizabeth requested the couple’s dog Zinna, who likely died from dehydration and starvation, be buried with Arakawa.
Elizabeth made the request in a phone call with authorities, which featured in footage released by the Santa Fe County Sheriff’s Office on Friday (local time), according to TMZ.
“I’m thinking … cremate the dog and bury it with Betsy,” Elizabeth said.
She also requested the dog’s collar be given to her if the animal had been wearing one.
The revelations came after the timeline of the death of Arakawa was thrown into question after a doctor declared she called his clinic 24 hours after police initially said she died.
Dr Heather Jarrell from the New Mexico Medical Investigator's Office earlier this month concluded Arakawa likely died on February 11, one week before her husband, from hantavirus pulmonary syndrome – a severe respiratory disease.
However, Dr Josiah Child, who runs Cloudberry Health in Santa Fe, New Mexico, said: ""Mrs Hackman didn't die on February 11 because she called my clinic on February 12.
""She'd called me a couple of weeks before her death to ask about getting an echocardiogram (heart scan) for her husband,"" Dr Child told The Mail.
""She was not a patient of mine, but one of my patients recommended Cloudberry to her. She made an appointment for herself for February 12.
He said Mrs Hackman cancelled her scheduled appointment two days before she was due to see him, saying her husband was not well.
The doctor asked her to come in that afternoon, but Dr Child said Mrs Hackman never attended the appointment, which was unrelated to hantavirus, and calls to her went unanswered.
In a statement on Tuesday, Santa Fe County Sheriff’s Office told E! News the office did not report an explicit date of death and claimed phone records verified Dr Child’s account.",SKY News,lifestyle
Married At First Sight bride Awhina's twin sister Cleo fires back at bride Carina's comments after her intimate connection to groom Paul rocked show,Isabella Rayner,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/celebrity-life/married-at-first-sight-bride-awhinas-twin-sister-cleo-fires-back-at-bride-carinas-comments-after-her-intimate-connection-to-groom-paul-rocked-show/news-story/85c1067d949fc6cad9d1ad227c7b8cd1,"Married At First Sight bride Awhina Rutene's twin sister has broken her silence after her connection to groom Paul Antoine rocked the experiment.
It comes as the controversial partner swap challenge returned to fans' screens on Monday evening.
Awhina and Paul were made to spend a night together in the ultimate test of their loyalties to Adrian Araouzou and Carina Mirabile, respectively.
Carina moved in with TeeJay Halkias for the challenge but broke down in protest over Paul's new close confinement with Awhina.
Paul and Awhina's twin sister Cleo Rutene previously dated for a few months in 2022 before his reality TV debut on MAFS.
For this reason, Carina said she preferred Paul partner with any other bride for the challenge.
“You’ve already slept with her sister now you’re going to sleep in the same bed as her,” the brunette beauty said.
“(I have) no hard feelings toward Awhina, but Awhina and her sister look identical so I don’t want Awhina moving into our apartment and sleeping in our bed with my husband.
""I’m just thinking about how I have the actively loan my husband out to Awhina when my husband has a history with her twin sister. It’s f****** weird.""
Paul agreed the situation was not ideal, but then appeared to go behind his wife's back and told Awhina she had allegedly made insulting comments about Cleo's appearance some weeks before.
Allegedly referring to Cleo's tattooed look, Carina is said to have told Paul, “I didn’t know you would go for that kind of calibre.""
Awhina was enraged when she heard what Carina had said and defended her twin, saying she would ""never ever say these things to people.""
""Where are you, Carina, in your life to say these things to people?” she said.
After the explosive revelations, Cleo found herself at the centre of mass public attention and took to Instagram Stories to address Carina's comments.
""So my inbox has been flooded from people wanting to know how I feel about the comment that was made by Carina,"" she said on Monday.
""I would have preferred none of my past relationships be aired, however, my sister went on a reality TV show, so this is bound to happen.""
""I found it really, really sh**ty, just because when I had seen leaked photos of Paul and Carina, I was saying how beautiful she looked, and how happy I am for them.
""I have spoken to Paul's closest friend because I'm on good terms with his friends and vice versa, and I had expressed how happy I was for them.
Cleo said she was especially disappointed after feeling happy for Carina when she heard from Paul's friends that their relationship was going well.
""They had said they were getting along great and I was all in support. For her to then turn around and say I'm of low calibre based solely on my physical attributes was really sh**ty. We're all out here trying to do better,"" she said.
Cleo also likened people who ""judge"" others to ""Mean Girls 2.0,"" adding ""so don't point fingers at Jamie,"" which appeared to be a jibe at Carina.
It comes after bride Jamie Marinos and Lauren Hall argued at the couple's retreat, with Carina referring to their spat as being like the iconic movie.",SKY News,lifestyle
'Like a dream': Teresa Palmer announces she is pregnant with fifth child one year after Aussie star's miscarriage,Isabella Rayner,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/celebrity-life/like-a-dream-teresa-palmer-announces-she-is-pregnant-with-fifth-child-one-year-after-aussie-stars-miscarriage/news-story/6a888bae7ecc2d1216d9689d9d51f9bd,"Teresa Palmer has announced she is pregnant with her fifth child, nearly one year after the Australian actress suffered a miscarriage.
The 39-year-old scream queen known for starring in a slew of horror films took to Instagram on Thursday to share the happy news.
Palmer showed off her growing baby bump in several photos posing alongside her four children she shares with her American husband Mark Webber.
“Our family is expanding...overwhelmed with gratitude to be welcoming another little one into our lives. Feels like a dream,” she wrote.
The Wolf Creek actress and Webber, 44, have two sons and daughters, Bodhi Rain, Forest Sage, Poet Lake, and Prairie Moon.
Palmer is also a stepmother to Webber’s son Isaac Love from his previous relationship with American actress Frankie Shaw.
The blonde youngsters could be seen holding Palmer’s stomach at what appeared to be the beach where the family resides in the Beachwood Canyon community of Los Angeles.
The mother-of-five-to-be is also seen pulling an excited face as Webber points to her bump.
She then shared a sweet moment comparing the bump with her pregnant friend Sarah Olsen.
Palmer’s famous friends including Australian actress Christie Hayes took to the comments section to congratulate her on her ‘rainbow baby’.
“Congratulations Mumma!!! So happy for you all. I knew this baby would find you somewhere over the rainbow,” Hayes wrote.
The O.C actress Rachel Bilson wrote: “Beautiful fam. Can’t wait for the new addition.”
“All of the dreams you’ve ever wanted. I’m so happy for you!” model Jaime King, who has graced the pages of fashion magazines Vogue and Harper’s Bazaar, said.
Paris Hilton wrote, “Congratulations,” while Megan Gale reflected on a nostalgic memory she shared with Palmer, in which she opened up about her desire to have a big family.
“This makes me smile. A lot. Years ago, you told me you wanted to have as many kids as possible, and look at you, glorious Mama,” the model wrote.
“You were born to be Mama and so many other wonderful things. Congratulations Goddess.”
The news comes after Palmer announced she had a miscarriage through a video on Instagram last May.
To the tune of New York Piano Company's Somewhere over the Rainbow, the actress showed her positive pregnancy test to her children before she was later seen in tears and resting.
""TW: pregnancy loss. It feels really good to be able to share my story,' she wrote in her caption last May,"" Palmer wrote in the caption.
""It feels really good to be able to share my story. Honoured and grateful to have been able to carry this little soul, my fifth baby, in my heart and body for the past three months.
""Sometimes in life, things happen that we just don’t understand. Brimming with gratitude for my people who have held me close during this time.
""To anyone who knows the pain of pregnancy loss, sending you immense love.""
In 2022, Palmer discussed the possibility of having twins and said six children could be the magic number that would solve her family's puzzle.
“I would like to have a few more. But I haven’t told my agents that. They keep saying, ‘You’re finished, aren’t you?’"" she told Confidential.
“On our first date, I told Mark I wanted six (children), and he said he also wanted six, so I am holding him to that number.
“Twins run in the family, so you never know; I might get two for one next time.”
Palmer will star alongside Bella Heathcote and Philippa Northeast in ABC's TV adaptation of Sally Hepworth's novel The Family Next Door.
The six-part drama is being filmed in Victoria and will air on ABC TV and ABC iView this year.",SKY News,lifestyle
Queen Mary's 19-year-old-son Crown Prince Christian subtly debuts new name as royal watchers spot the unexpected detail on his military uniform,Chloe Walker,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/celebrity-life/queen-marys-19yearoldson-crown-prince-christian-subtly-debuts-new-name-as-royal-watchers-spot-the-unexpected-detail-on-his-military-uniform/news-story/73033be840ad1446bd72890acc00f306,"Crown Prince Christian of Denmark has officially stepped into military life, and with it, he has acquired a new name.
The 19-year-old royal reunited with his family on Sunday outside the army barracks in Slagelse, marking his first meeting with them since beginning his mandatory training a month ago.
Photographed alongside his mother, Tasmanian-born Queen Mary, his father, King Frederik, and siblings Princess Isabella, 17, and twins Prince Vincent and Princess Josephine, 14, Christian was dressed in full camouflage military uniform, complete with the traditional black beret.
But it was a subtle detail on his uniform that caught the attention of observant royal fans- his new military name, Trekroner, meaning ""Three Crowns"" displayed on his chest.
Patrick Kjellerup, press officer at the Guard Hussar Regiment, told BT News: ""Trekroner is a name that has been given to the Crown Prince by the Life Company.
""It is an old hussar tradition that you are named after the town you come from.""
While the Danish royal family resides at Amalienborg Palace in Copenhagen, Trekroner Fort is an artificial island near the capital, historically built to protect Copenhagen and Denmark from external threats.
""The Life Company wanted his name to symbolise a protector or guardian of Denmark,"" Kjellerup explained.
The military press officer also noted that the name carries symbolic ties to the navy, which Danish crown princes and kings have traditionally had a strong connection to.
Interestingly, Christian's father was simply known as ""Crown Prince Frederik"" during his own time in service.
Under the Danish constitution, Prince Christian must complete at least four months of national service, though it remains unclear whether he will pursue further education within the armed forces once his training is complete.
His father, King Frederik, underwent military service in the Royal Life Guards in 1986 before joining the Guard Hussar Regiment, where he was later appointed as a lieutenant in the reserve and became a platoon commander.
He also trained as a frogman with the elite Frogman Corps.
Meanwhile, Queen Mary drew attention during the royal family's visit to Slagelse, with Spanish media outlet Vanitatis describing her as the ""main star"" of the occasion.
The publication praised her ""sophisticated and elegant look"", noting her ""modern"" choice of a long black coat, denim shirt, and trousers, which were accentuated by a thin Celine belt.
During the visit, Christian was seen showing his younger brother, Prince Vincent, a handwritten notebook and giving Queen Mary a tour of his dormitory.
One official photo also showed Princess Isabella trying on her brother's military gear- a possible sign that she, too, may follow in his footsteps and complete national service.",SKY News,lifestyle

The Duchess of Sussex, 43, posted a statement on Instagram stating the first episode of Confessions of a Female Founder will air on April 8.
""I’m so excited to share with you something else I’ve been working on: 'Confessions of a Female Founder' my new podcast with @lemonadamedia!"" she wrote on Friday.
""I’ve been having candid conversations with amazing women who have turned dreams into realities and scaled small ideas into massively successful businesses.
""They’re opening up, sharing their tips, tricks (and tumbles), and letting me pick their brains as I build out my own business, As ever.
""It has been absolutely eye-opening, inspiring…and fun! (Because what’s the point if we can’t have some fun on this wild adventure?)""
The former ex-working royal's podcast cover photo shows her posing against a plain background in a blue shirt.
Lemonada is the American podcast network behind Wiser Than Me with Julia Louis-Dreyfus and will release the Confessions of a Female Founder trailer on March 25.
""As Meghan herself navigates the world of entrepreneurship with the upcoming launch of her brand As ever, be inspired by the real, unfiltered stories and lessons learned from notable female founders—from knowing your worth to trusting your gut, securing investors and investing in yourself,"" the company wrote on Instagram on Friday.
Fans reacted in the comments section, with one person saying they were ""loving this era"" of Meghan in the wake of the release of her Netflix cooking series With Love, Meghan and her lifestyle business As Ever.
""For all the incessant scrutiny over her every move, this lady seems to be the embodiment of 'love wins' - I hope she continues to thrive,"" another person said.
""So excited about this because it’s so needed. My first business mentor was a woman who had been in our industry for over 30 years, and she literally gave me her playbook for success,"" one more person wrote.
""It changed my life and has allowed for me to follow in her footsteps while creating new lanes of my own. Love to see women supporting women!
However, other people said her podcast was unoriginal, with many likening the concept to the existing podcast Confessions of a CEO
""The only thing she's good at is copying everything she does... her lack of originality is mind blowing!"" one person wrote on X.
""Tell me you don’t have a single original thought without telling me you don’t have a single original thought,"" said another person.
Lemonada’s CEO Jessica Cordova Kramer said she and co-founder Stephanie Wittels Wachs were ""grateful"" to work with Meghan on the ""exact podcast we needed when we started Lemonada"" in 2019.
Stephanie described Meghan as a ""warm and welcoming person"", saying listeners will feel this in her interviews.
""She creates a comfortable space for her guests to bring fascinating personal stories to the table and open up in a way they likely haven’t before publicly,"" she said.
""Listeners can expect conversations that are way more break room than boardroom.""
The eight-part Confessions of a Female Founder series will have episodes released weekly and is Meghan's second podcast.
The Duchess struck a deal with Lemonada in February last year as the company agreed to redistribute her previous series Archetypes, which was initially made for streaming giant Spotify, to all audio platforms.
Archetypes saw Meghan speak with celebrities, including Mariah Carey, Mindy Kaling, Serena Williams and Paris Hilton, about the history of stereotypes levelled against women.
Spotify and the Sussexes Archewell company banner released an official joint statement in June 2023 saying they were ""proud of the series we made together” but ""mutually agreed to part ways.""
Archetypes reached No. 1 in the podcast charts in more than six countries and won the People's Choice Award for The Pop Podcast of 2022.
Meghan also won the Entertainment Podcast Host award at the 48th Annual Gracie Awards the following year.",SKY News,lifestyle
'Don't be scared to start over': Isla Fisher makes cryptic Instagram post about life after Sacha Baron Cohen split,Reilly Sullivan,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/celebrity-life/dont-be-scared-to-start-over-isla-fisher-opens-up-in-poignant-instagram-post-after-sacha-baron-cohen-split/news-story/2ce5726210f1abcd174eed9f4d116dda,"Isla Fisher has shared a message about “starting over” after returning to Australia following her split from longtime partner Sacha Baron Cohen.
The former couple, who share three children, previously split their time between homes in Sydney, London and Los Angeles after their 2010 wedding in Paris.
Fisher, 49, and Baron Cohen, 53, announced their separation in April last year via a joint statement on social media.
""After a long tennis match lasting over 20 years, we are finally putting our racquets down,"" the former couple wrote alongside a photo of themselves in tennis whites.
On Monday, the Wedding Crashers star shared a cryptic Instagram story encouraging her followers to be unafraid of “starting over”.
“Don’t be scared to start over, you might like your new story better,” the message said.
The Aussie movie star, 49, is currently on the Gold Coast filming a movie called Spa Weekend also starring Leslie Mann, Michelle Buteau and Anna Faris.
Fisher and her co-stars were recently forced to “hunker down” after Cyclone Alfred battered the region over the weekend.
The update comes as the actress continues her return to the spotlight following a brief hiatus amid her shock split from the Borat star.
Last month, Fisher led the voice cast on the animated film Dog Man and appeared in a cameo role in the latest Bridget Jones film.
The former Home And Away actress has also recently consolidated her property portfolio after selling off an apartment in Sydney’s ritzy Woollahra.
Fisher reportedly paid just $171,500 for the two-bedroom, one-bathroom apartment in the late Art Deco block Wiltshire Towers back in 1995 and unloaded the property for a rumoured $930,000.
It is understood the movie star, who is still reportedly finalising her divorce settlement from Baron Cohen, no longer owns property in the country after the Woollahra sale.",SKY News,lifestyle
"'Three guesses': J.K. Rowling reignites feud with Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson as she savages Harry Potter trio",Isabella Rayner,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/celebrity-life/three-guesses-jk-rowling-reignites-feud-with-daniel-radcliffe-rupert-grint-emma-watson-as-she-savages-harry-potter-trio/news-story/3028116d0bb5b0dc1d180250b562c56e,"J.K. Rowling appears to have reignited her feud with Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson via a savage online dig at the Harry Potter trio.
The controversial British author of the seven-volume fantasy novel series, which is the best-selling book series in history having sold more than 600 million copies worldwide, holds gender-critical views.
Rowling has publicly mocked the phrase ""people who menstruate"", said women's rights and ""lived reality"" would be ""erased"" if ""sex isn't real"", and called a list of trans women ""men, every last one of them"".
The author disputes claims her views, which have been met with criticism from Radcliffe, Grint and Watson, are ""transphobic"".
She was once close to the Harry Potter child stars but previously said she would not forgive the trio for criticising her opinions and told them to ""save their apologies"" for “traumatised de transitioners”.
Rowling took to X on Wednesday to answer the question: ""What actor/actress instantly ruins a movie for you?""
""Three guesses. Sorry, but that was irresistible,"" the author said, adding laughing emojis.
Many people assumed Rowling's comment was a direct dig at Radcliffe, Grint and Watson, whose characters are known in the Harry Potter fandom as the Golden Trio.
""It seems J.K. Rowling's 'three guesses' comment might be a jab at the three main *Harry Potter* actors—Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint—due to their public support for trans rights, which contrasts with her controversial views on the topic,"" one person said.
""Over the years, Rowling has expressed frustration with these actors for distancing themselves from her stance, and this tension has been widely discussed online.
""Classy. Real classy. There are better ways to get attention than trying to beef people 30 years younger than you, ya know, but no better way to look like the bitter old woman you've become. You're such a disappointment, JK,"" one more person said.
However, fans of Rowling said she was within her rights to slight the three stars, saying the trio turned against the author who put them on the map and effectively made them millionaires.
""I wouldn't be sorry. Their lives changed thanks to your work, and how do they repay you? Betrayal,"" one person said.
""Three guesses? 1. The same people who made millions off your work, then turned on you when it was ‘cool’,"" a second fan said.
""What a shame they were not capable of summoning within themselves the loyalty, love and friendship exemplified by the characters they were so very privileged to play,"" one more person said.
Rowling's supporters include American network HBO, which is owned by Harry Potter filmmaker Warner Bros.
Last November, HBO chief Casey Bloys said her views have not ""affected the casting or hiring of writers or productions staff” of the impending revamp of the Harry Potter series into a long-form TV show.
“J.K. Rowling has a right to express her personal views. We will remain focused on the development of the new series, which will only benefit from her involvement,"" a spokesperson for the network told Variety.
Rowling first liked a 'transphobic' X comment in 2018 and went public about her belief that transgender women are men and transgender men are women in June 2020.
Subsequently, Radcliffe, who played Harry Potter, wrote an open letter through the LGBT charity The Trevor Project and accused the author of eliminating transgender's people's ""identity"" through her opinions.
“Transgender women are women. Any statement to the contrary erases the identity and dignity of transgender people,"" the letter read.
“To all the people who now feel that their experience of the books has been tarnished or diminished, I am deeply sorry for the pain these comments have caused you.”
In a formal statement in 2020, Grint (Ron Weasley) said he ""firmly stand(s) with the trans community and echo(s) the sentiments expressed by many of my peers.
""Trans women are women. Trans men are men.
“We should all be entitled to live with love and without judgement,” he concluded.
Watson, whose character was Hermione Granger, on X said: “Trans people are who they say they are and deserve to live their lives without being constantly questioned or told they aren’t who they say they are.
“I want my trans followers to know that I and so many other people around the world see you, respect you and love you for who you are,” she said in 2020.
On her website, Rowling has said her experience of domestic abuse and sexual assault spurred her controversial views.",SKY News,lifestyle

Photos showed the Dance Monkey hitmaker showing off her slim figure in a black blazer and boots, while her long blonde locks were styled in loose waves.
She held a bouquet of red roses beside her husband in what appeared to be a hotel room.
Meanwhile, Bedford looked dapper next to his wife in a striped shirt and black pants for the celebration.

""Wow, look at you, you look amazing. I think you looked just as stunning as before, though. How did you get so fit?"" one person said.
""Hot couple alert,"" another person said.
""Happy Anniversary to the most beautiful couple on this planet,"" a third person said.
Tones and I burst onto the music scene in 2019, and fans have long since associated her with her trademark tomboy appearance.
She typically wore baseball caps, sunglasses, and loose-fitting tracksuits at performances, red carpets, and photoshoots.
However, on social media, she has recently showcased her dramatic new look through photos of her beaming in feminine figure-hugging dresses.
In August, the star addressed her weight loss and said she has struggled with public attention on her appearance.
""I've lost weight, so apparently that's the biggest thing that's ever happened to me in my life,"" she told Cosmopolitan Australia.
""Everything is up for discussion. My body shape, my music, my livelihood, my relationship. I wish I could say that I could be someone where that doesn't affect me.
""But it does. Especially when like, my nanna, my family – they can see everything.""
Tones and I also said she always identified with a more feminine style but previously felt uncomfortable expressing herself through fashion.
""I'm not a tomboy, I'm a girly girl and I always have been,"" she said.
""But I didn't feel comfortable in myself and my body, so I covered myself up.""

"Prince Harry's US immigration documents finally released, key details remain hidden after two-year legal fight",Chloe Walker,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/celebrity-life/prince-harrys-us-immigration-documents-finally-released-key-details-remain-hidden-after-twoyear-legal-fight/news-story/fc695caa057130f560917528ef94ec82,"The US government has unsealed documents related to Prince Harry's immigration status after a two-year legal battle, but large portions remain redacted.
On Tuesday, more than 80 pages of court filings and transcripts were made public via six documents, though much of the information was blacked out, leaving critical questions unanswered.
The documents confirm that the Duke of Sussex, 40, adhered to all ""applicable rules and regulations"" when he moved to the United States with his wife, Meghan Markle, 43,  in 2020.
A Department of Homeland Security lawyer further stated that the Biden administration did not grant the former working royal special treatment in his visa application.
While Judge Carl Nichols ordered the release of Harry's visa application under the Freedom of Information Act earlier this week, much of it remains concealed.
Immigration officials argued that the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, failed to prove that the public interest in disclosing Harry's records outweighed his right to privacy.
""Plaintiffs allege that the records should be disclosed as public confidence in the government would suffer or to establish whether the Duke was granted preferential treatment.
""This speculation by Plaintiffs does not point to any evidence of government misconduct,"" wrote Jarrod Panter, an official in the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, part of the Department of Homeland Security.
""The records, as explained above, do not support such an allegation but show the regulatory process involved in reviewing and granting immigration benefits which was done in compliance with the Immigration and Nationality Act and applicable rules and regulations.""
The Heritage Foundation had sued the Department of Homeland Security in May 2023, questioning whether Harry had been truthful on his immigration paperwork.
The lawsuit stemmed from Harry's explosive 2023 memoir, Spare, where he admitted to past drug use, including cocaine and magic mushrooms- admissions that could typically impact a visa application.
The Washington-based think tank argued that Harry may have received preferential treatment, as an admission of drug use can be grounds for visa denial.
The records pertain to the foundation's efforts to unseal the Duke's visa application but do not include the application itself, leaving longstanding questions unanswered as to whether Harry lied on his application about his drug use or whether President Biden's administration decided to overlook it.
Earlier in the year, President Trump ruled out deporting the father-of-two despite flirting with the idea of expelling the ex-working royal during his presidential campaign.
""I don't want to do that,"" the President told the New York Post in January.
""I'll leave him alone. He's got enough problems with his wife. She's terrible.""
A royal insider told SkyNews.com.au that allegations that Prince Harry received preferential treatment during his U.S. immigration process were ""unequivocally dismissed"" following the document release.
""Furthermore, the redactions in the case further reinforce that the Heritage Foundation’s claim that the Duke’s immigration records should be considered a matter of public interest is without merit,"" they said.
The insider also highlighted a statement made by an immigration expert to Vanity Fair in February, which claimed Harry faced ""an extraordinary level of scrutiny over his immigration status- far beyond what almost anybody else would ever experience"".

'He was a very underrated driver': Legendary 1981 Bathurst 1000 champion John French dead at 94,Reilly Sullivan,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/celebrity-life/he-was-a-very-underrated-driver-legendary-1981-bathurst-1000-champion-john-french-dead-at-94/news-story/a31866b71f26be66e4af1af56d472cc7,"Legendary Aussie race car driver John French has died at the age of 94.
It is understood the retired racer died in Brisbane on 12 March 2025 with a funeral held for French last week.
French is perhaps best known for co-driving with Dick Johnson to win the Bathurst 1000 in the famous ‘Tru-Blu’ Ford XD Falcon back in 1981.
Born in Millaa Millaa in rural Queensland in 1930, French’s motorsport career began in the 1960s, including a win in the 1962 Australian GT Championship.
In 1969, French paired with Allan Moffat to win the Sandown Three Hour race in a Ford Falcon GTHO Phase I.
But it was French and Johnson’s victory in the crash-shortened 1981 Bathurst 1000 for which the Queenslander will be best remembered.
French was driving the #17 Ford XD Falcon when the race was stopped due to a crash and the victory briefly made John the oldest winner in Mount Panorama history.
Outside of racing, French was a high profile multi-franchise car dealer selling BMC vehicles, Alfa Romeo, Renault, Peugeot and Subaru in Brisbane.
In a statement via Facebook, French’s Bathurst 1000 co-driver paid tribute to his “true friend”.
“It is with a heavy heart that we share with you that a core pillar of the foundation of our team, a legend of the sport and true friend passed away last night,” Johnson wrote.
“John, who we all affectionately called JC, was the oldest bloke to ever win the Bathurst 1000, when he shared the car with me in 1981.
“Only to be later pipped to second oldest in 2002 by only a few weeks, something he was never able to forgive Jim Richards for!
“As far as I’m concerned, he was a very underrated driver and he always shared the mantle with the likes of Moffat, Geoghegan, Gibson, Bond and Brock.

The 29-year-old took to Instagram on Tuesday evening to address her on-screen husband Ryan Donnelly's allegations that her Manly apartment was, in fact, rented for a single night during this week's homestays.
""For anyone curious, this was taken at my actual Manly apartment,"" she wrote over a video of herself posing on her balcony.
""As a single lady, security and privacy are important to me and my friends.
""I didn't feel comfortable opening my home up to all of Australia.""
Jacqui also posted photos of herself in her bedroom, saying she did so ""for anyone actually super nosy (about what her room looked like)...hope that gives everyone a good enough idea.""
Homestay week is purportedly designed to give participants a glimpse into how their lives might look with their 'spouse' outside the experiment.
Ryan took to Instagram on Tuesday and claimed to expose his on-screen wife's apartment as a fraud.
""This wasn't Jacqui's home,"" he wrote over a photo of the couple entering what the show claimed was the jewellery business owner's ""kingdom"".
""It was an Airbnb booked for the one night we filmed in Manly.
""Her actual place was a rental apartment with two other housemates.""
The project manager said Jacqui's real-life home was ""tiny"" and could not accommodate the camera crew inside.
The cost of the Airbnb rented instead was $200 per night, the Daily Mail Australia reported.
Jacqui is understood to be currently in a relationship with groom Clint Rice and living at his multi-million-dollar home in Tasmania.
She reportedly relocated to the island state from Sydney after production wrapped last December.
Viewers have accused the former lawyer of being a ""golddigger"" and ""loopy"", with fans lambasting her for ""fake crying"" about seemingly mundane details like having a television in hers and Ryan's bedroom.
It comes as Jacqui exclusively revealed to SkyNews.com.au she is ""unable to work"" as a lawyer because of her portrayal on the show.
She claimed she had not worked as a lawyer at a firm in NSW since the show aired in January, alleging her edit affected her capacity to perform.
""I essentially left my job after I tried to go back to work because I was mentally distressed and couldn't work,"" the reality TV star said.
""I've been unable to continue my career... I've been left to fend on my own, basically.
""I wasn't medically capable of performing my duties because I was under so much mental distress and trauma.""",SKY News,lifestyle
'A Current Affair does this every day': Married At First Sight fans accuse Nine of hypocrisy over cease and desist letter to journalist who approached expert John Aiken,Isabella Rayner,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/celebrity-life/a-current-affair-does-this-every-day-married-at-first-sight-fans-accuse-nine-of-hypocrisy-over-cease-and-desist-letter-to-journalist-who-approached-expert-john-aiken/news-story/f6228d442c442b553446c0eea06536a9,"Married At First Sight fans have called the Nine Network hypocritical after it sent a cease and desist letter to a journalist who approached the show's expert John Aiken in public, comparing his tactics to those used by the network's flagship news show A Current Affair (ACA).
Nine sent the letter to MAFS Funny podcast host Joshua Fox after the content creator approached Mr Aiken in the Sydney suburb of Double Bay last Friday and started questioning him about the dating show's ethics.
In footage of the encounter posted by Joshua on Instagram, he said: “The Married At First Sight experts are the real villains of this show.
""Everything they do is just designed to destroy the couples. They need to be held accountable.
“And since all of my emails and messages (to Nine) go unanswered, I’m going full A Current Affair style and tracking them down in real life.
""You know, just taking inspiration from Channel Nine’s second biggest show after Married At First Sight.”
It comes as MAFS participants allege the experts, including Mel Schilling and Alessandra Rampolla, wear earpieces through which producers tell them what to say to the couples during Commitment Ceremony episodes.
It's further alleged the experts decline to answer the couples' questions seeking legitimate guidance on their relationship issues and instead prioritise drama and ratings.
Joshua confronted Mr Aiken in a car park and asked if he ever felt “ethically and morally compromised by what you do on the show”.
Mr Aiken said he would not answer the journalist's questions and started walking to a nearby café.
Joshua followed the expert and asked if ""money or fame"" made him ""go against the principles of a psychologist"" on the show, using a technique called the ""bounce"".
""Bounce"" is often used by ACA reporters and refers to a situation in which a journalist or press pack confronts a person unlikely to want to answer questions, typically resulting in a confrontation or refusal to cooperate.
Mr Aiken, sitting in the café, then got out his phone and began filming the journalist.
The following day, Nine sent Joshua a legal letter which accused him of the “harassment of John Aiken”.
“Your behavior disrupted the café patrons and concluded with what Mr Aiken perceived as an impliedly threatening statement to the effect of ‘this is not going to end well this year John’,” the letter reads, reported The Australian on Tuesday.
Nine’s lawyers requested Joshua “immediately cease and desist” from approaching, harassing, or attempting to contact Mr Aiken, Ms Schilling and Ms Rampolla.
Fans soon took to Instagram to declare the letter was hypocritical of Nine as ACA reporters continue using the bounce technique.
""A Current Affair does this every day to people,"" one person said.
""Haha, the irony of their actions,"" another person said.
""Pretty sure their ACA ‘journalists’ are FAR more intimidating/ intrusive with the general public than that exchange,"" one more person said.
""Don’t let that get in your way Josh. They do the EXACT same TACTICS ON ACA. Keep pushing you’ll get the answers you’re looking for,"" a fourth person said.
Speaking to SkyNews.com.au on Thursday, Joshua insisted his questioning of Mr Aiken was in the ""public's interest"".
""Asking public figures questions that are of public interest is the core foundation of journalism, and I'm glad people agree with this,"" he said.
""John (Aiken) is always so vocal on the show towards the couples and saying how he likes to hold a mirror up to them and make them accountable.
""Yet he had nothing to say in real life when someone tried to hold a mirror up to him.""

Very surprising reviews roll in for new Snow White adaptation following widespread criticism over 'woke' take on the classic Disney tale,Isabella Rayner,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/celebrity-life/very-surprising-reviews-roll-in-for-new-snow-white-adaptation-following-widespread-criticism-over-woke-take-on-the-classic-disney-tale/news-story/e0348c710e12f159e344fe90e18400aa,"Critics have released the first reviews of Disney's new Snow White following criticism over the film's ""woke"" changes.
Disney spent more than $269.4 million on the live-action reimagining of Walt Disney Productions' 1937 animated film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, based on the 1812 fairy tale Snow White by the Brothers Grimm.
The remake stars American Rachel Zegler as Snow White and Israeli Gal Gadot as the Evil Queen and premiered in the US on March 15 at Los Angeles' El Capitan Theatre.
However, the premiere was scaled back to photographers and a house crew, and regular red-carpet press was absent amid controversies surrounding Zegler and Gadot's political views.
Gadot and Zegler's opposing stances on the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, with Gadot supporting Israel and Zegler supporting Palestine, have resulted in calls to boycott the film from both sides of the conflict.
Snow White has also been criticised for prioritising ""wokeness"" over authentic storytelling.
Fans have noticed traditional romance was dumped for being too ""sexist"", and the Seven Dwarfs were now seen as a diverse group of ""magical creatures"" of all heights, races, and genders.
Nevertheless, critics have mainly given early positive reviews of the remake, with Variety's film reporter Katcy Stephan praising Zegler's performance for adding ""newfound depth"" to the story.
Rachel Zegler is a shining supernova in #SnowWhite, beautifully embodying the graceful, gentle nature of the OG Disney princess,"" Stephan wrote on X.
""It's a visual feast with show-stopping new musical numbers and, of course, dozens of enchanting animated animals.
""The screenplay wisely gives its heroine newfound depth through her fervent desire to become the leader her father believed she could be and a love story that's sweet as apple pie.""
Crooked Media's Matt DeGroot also took to X to say the film moved him emotionally and praised its visual aesthetics.
""Despite becoming an internet punching bag, Disney's remake of Snow White is actually mostly successful!"" DeGroot said.
""Rachel Zegler is an absolute star, (most of) the new songs are catchy and beautifully performed, and the visual palette is sumptuous and vibrant. Gal Gadot had beautiful gowns.""
ScreenRant host Ash Crossan, meanwhile, gushed: ""Despite the bob being all over the place, #SnowWhite is quite charming!
""The message lands well, the critters are adorable, and Rachel Zegler and her enchanting voice are stunning. It almost got a full tear out of me, and I've never cried in my entire life.""
The DisInsider's Skyler Shuler echoed Crossan's sentiment and said that despite her initial worry about the film, it is ""PURE DISNEY MAGIC!""
""This will end up being a lot of people's favourite live-action remake,"" Shuler wrote on X.
Others have questioned Zegler, who is Latina, for playing Snow White, as the original film described the character's skin as ""as white as snow.""
The actress called the original 1937 film ""dated"" because the prince ""literally stalks Snow White"".
""The original cartoon came out in 1937, and very evidently so,"" she told Extra TV back in 2022.
""There's a big focus on her love story with a guy who literally stalks her. Weird. So we didn't do that this time.
""I was scared of the original version. I think I watched it once and never picked it up again. I'm being so serious.""
David Hand, whose father co-directed the original animated film, previously criticised the remake and said it was ""insulting"", suggesting his father and Walt Disney would be ""turning in their graves.""
Conservative media organisation The Daily Wire subsequently announced it will release its own live-action adaptation of the original fairy tale entitled Snow White and the Evil Queen in 2025 release to compete with Disney's version.",SKY News,lifestyle
'You can do a home invasion and not get deported': The Project star Kate Langbroek mocks calls to deport US tourist Sam Jones over 'distressing' baby wombat stunt,Chloe Walker,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/celebrity-life/you-can-do-a-home-invasion-and-not-get-deported-the-project-star-kate-langbroek-mocks-calls-to-deport-us-tourist-sam-jones-over-distressing-baby-wombat-stunt/news-story/52e1757ad3864fdc29a96393e26b8e6d,"The Project host Kate Langbroek has taken a surprising stance in defence of a US tourist who filmed herself removing a baby wombat from its mother in the Australian outback.
Sam Jones, a self-described ""hunter"" and ""environmental scientist"", sparked outrage after posting footage of the act online, with Australians calling for her deportation and visa cancellation.
However, on Thursday night’s episode of The Project, Langbroek pushed back, dismissing the idea of deportation as ""insane"".
When co-host Sarah Harris asked whether Jones should be expelled from the country, the 59-year-old comedian was firm in her response.
""Of course not,"" she said.
Harris pointed out that further footage had surfaced of Jones handling an echidna and a baby shark.
""I'm surprised she can’t be fined at least,"" Harris added.
Langbroek appeared to downplay the situation, mimicking outraged social media users.
""It's just like, 'Let’s cancel her visa',"" joked the TV host.
""Make it a teachable moment.""
Co-host Waleed Aly nodded and said, ""Yeah, I agree"".
Langbroek continued: ""But you can do anything you want in this country. You can do a home invasion and not get deported.
""But you fiddle with a [wombat]—you know what I mean, it just seems excessive.""
Aly chimed in: ""Why is it that deporting people seems to be our first port of call?""
""I know, why is it?"" Langbroek responded.
Senior government sources have confirmed to Sky News Ms Jones left the country voluntarily this morning.
On Thursday, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told reporters he was ""outraged"" by the footage.
""To take a baby wombat from its mother, clearly causing distress from the mother, is just an outrage,"" Mr Albanese said.
Sky News Australia revealed the Department of Immigration was reviewing the terms of Jones' visa to determine whether she could be removed from the country.
Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke confirmed officials were investigating whether immigration law had been breached, adding, ""I can't wait for Australia to see the back of this individual.""
Ms Jones, who has previously been referred to as Samantha Strable in a hunting publication and goes by the username @samstrays_somewhere on Instagram, also used the word ""insane"" to describe the angry response she's received from the Australian public.
The American social media influencer issued an apology on Saturday.
In the first part of her statement released to her Instagram page, Ms Strable said she had been “extremely concerned” for the animals on the side of the road and did not want them to get hit by a car.
She claimed upon realising the joey was not running off, she was “concerned it may have been sick or injured” and made a “snap judgement” to pick it up to see if this was the case.
“I ran, not to rip the joey away from its mother, but from fear she might attack me,” she said.
Ms Strable went on to apologise, stating: “I have done a great deal of reflection on this situation and have realised that I did not handle this situation as best as I should have.”
In a second part to her statement released a short time later, Ms Jones defiantly insisted she was not a “villain” as she hit out at Australia’s apparent hypocrisy.
""Over holding a wombat thousands threaten my life,"" she said.

The 'What Women Want' star took to Instagram on Wednesday, posting a cheerful snap with her boyfriend, actor Jeffrey Nordling.
A devoted LA Dodgers fan, Hunt posed outside Chicago's Wrigley Field with windswept hair and a natural no-makeup look.
""Tonight I saw @officialwrigleyfield (just from the outside) for the first time. My God. What a beautiful place,"" she captioned the post.

While many followers shared their excitement for the upcoming game, a wave of comments focused on Hunt's noticeably different appearance.
""Everyone here: Go sports team!! Me: Oh god! What happened to her face?!"" one user wrote.
""She doesn’t even look like Helen Hunt,"" another commented.
""Wow! Would never have known it was her. But good for you, Helen. It's hard aging gracefully,"" a third added.
Others jumped to Hunt's defence, applauding her natural look.
""She looks great!"" one fan wrote, while another chimed in: ""Lovely pic. You look gorgeous, Helen.""
Hunt has previously spoken candidly about letting go of societal pressures around aging.
""I had my run in the ’80s about being really worried about how I looked,"" she told Huffington Post in 2015.
""Everybody was more fit or more thin, and I maxed out on worrying about it. I just gave up on worrying about it.""
She also revealed that shifting her focus improved both her mental and physical well-being.
""I was taking these exercise classes called 'abs, thighs, and buns' and I was like, 'I'm going to be dead one day—do I really want to give up an hour in this class?'""

Serious, 71, made headlines earlier this month after being accused of unlawfully occupying the home of Charles ""Phillip"" Porter, an elderly man with dementia.
While the actor has denied the allegations, Mr Porter's power of attorney and landlord, Margaret Charlton, has taken the matter to the NSW Civil and Administrative Tribunal (NCAT) to have Serious evicted.
On Wednesday, Serious, real name Greg Gomez Pead, appeared before Member Graham Kinsey at the tribunal in Sydney to respond to the application.
""I'm greatly improving, I was very close to death very recently … I just, I'm coming good, but I'm having trouble with just recall of day-to-day things,"" Serious told the tribunal, as reported by the Daily Telegraph.
Serious said his health had been ""very difficult,"" and it is understood he has recently undergone treatment for cancer.
""It's a very complex case and a humanitarian (matter),"" he said.
""I've been persecuted for the past two or three weeks; there's people watching where I go all the time.""
Serious claimed the rental arrangement was a verbal agreement and that Mr Porter's attorney had advised him to stay in the property as a caretaker.
However, in her original tribunal application, Ms Charlton refuted this, alleging that the Young Einstein star moved into Mr Porter's main residence without permission, blocking its sale - funds from which were needed for Mr Porter's ongoing care.
""Due to his diagnosis of dementia, Mr Porter has been placed in a nursing home, and I hold power of attorney for his affairs,"" Ms Charlton wrote.
""The Public Trustee has instructed me to sell the property in order to fund Mr Porter’s ongoing care. Failure to do so will result in his removal from his current care facility as he is an elderly patient with dementia.""
Ms Charlton claimed Serious had refused to leave and was not contributing financially to the home's upkeep.
""At present, the property is occupied by an individual, Mr Yahoo Serious, who has refused to vacate despite being served with a notice to vacate by February 8,"" she said.
She further alleged that Serious was ""not fulfilling any financial obligations"", including rent or utility payments, placing ""considerable strain"" on Mr Porter's finances.
""Additionally, he is preventing us from accessing the property to prepare it for sale.""
It's understood the civil matter will return to the tribunal no earlier than April 2.
The actor, once one of Australia's biggest stars and dubbed as the next Jim Carey, was reportedly evicted from his Avalon Beach home in 2020 for unpaid rent and had resorted to sleeping in his car.
Serious rose to fame in the late 1980s, known for his wild ginger hair and eccentric persona.
His 1988 hit Young Einstein. which he wrote, directed, and starred in, grossed $24.9 million worldwide and won an Australian Film Institute Award.
He followed with Reckless Kelly in 1993 and the lesser-performing Mr. Accident in 2000.
His former wife and collaborator, Australian screenwriter, producer, and actress Lulu Pinkus, worked on all three films before their reported separation in 2007.
In addition to his 2020 eviction, Serious was ordered to pay $15,000 in rent arrears.",SKY News,lifestyle
"Michelle Obama gripes about following Barack Obama to the White House, snipes about his tardiness amid split rumors",Unknown,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/celebrity-life/michelle-obama-gripes-about-following-barack-obama-to-the-white-house-snipes-about-his-tardiness-amid-split-rumors/news-story/ee83eb184699497759013302dd1c61f4,"It’s been eight years since former first lady Michelle Obama left the White House and she’s still grousing about how hard it was to follow Barack as he ascended to the highest office in the land.
The 61-year-old, who has been married to her husband since 1992, admitted her first reaction was “no way”, when she learned that Barack was running for the White House, in the debut episode of her podcast “IMO” with her brother, Craig Robinson, which premiered on Wednesday.
“I couldn’t have gotten through eight years in the White House without my big brother,” Michelle said, referring to Craig, 62, executive director of the National Association of Basketball Coaches.
Michelle Obama’s complaints come amid questions about the health of the Obamas’ marriage, as they’ve barely been seen together for months.
“Being married to the president of the United States [is a] thing that none of us kind of banked on. We knew Barack was smart and ambitious, but, you know,” she went on.
“You talked me into supporting his run,” she said, referring to Craig.
“And he [Barack] was smart enough to know that he needed to come to you and sell you on the idea. Because I was definitely like, no, no way,” Michelle said on the podcast.
Michelle, who has never made any secret of her dislike for politics, also brought up her frustrations with her husband’s constant tardiness when they started dating at the Chicago-based law firm Sidley Austin.
“Barack had to adjust to what ‘on time’ was,” she said.
“You know, I’ve got this husband who, when it’s time to leave, he’s getting up and going to the bathroom. And I was like, dude, like three o’clock departure means you’ve done all that. It’s like, don’t start looking for your glasses, you know, at the three o’clock departure,” she said, before admitting, “he’s improved over 30 years of marriage.”
Robinson spoke about his divorce during the episode as the two siblings discussed their childhood on the South Side of Chicago.
Michelle, who has published two non-fiction books since leaving the White House in 2017, also opened up about her irritation at the former president’s lack of deep conversations with his “buddies,” with whom he can spend up to five hours on the golf course.
“My husband is like, ‘what are you talking about all day?'” she told writer and actress Issa Rae in the second episode of her podcast, which premiered on the same day.
Obama “does not fully understand” the emotional complexities of female friendships, she added.
Michelle is set to interview a number of different guests, including Seth Rogen and Keke Palmer, while she and her brother offer advice from their own experiences.
Some guests, such as Tyler Perry, appeared on the former first lady’s previous project, “The Michelle Obama Podcast.”
The pair say they are not going to discuss current affairs on “IMO”, which stands for “in my opinion”.
It follows months of speculation about Barack and Michelle’s marriage, including wild, unfounded rumors that he was dating actress Jennifer Aniston.
Aniston, 56, said she had only “met him once”, as she was forced to deny the romance rumors on an appearance on “Jimmy Kimmel Live.”
“I know Michelle more than him,” the former “Friends” star said.
Obama was spotted dining alone at a DC restaurant in January where he received a loud ovation.
Michelle’s absence was also notable at both the funeral of former President Jimmy Carter and President Trump’s inauguration, which Barack Obama attended.
The Obamas shared a loved-up Valentine’s Day selfie last month in a post on X, with Michelle describing her husband as “my rock” in a separate post.
But last week, Barack was seen at a Los Angeles Clippers game without Michelle, leading to further speculation about the couple.

Alec, 66, and Hilaria, 41, spoke to Extra at the grand re-opening of Planet Hollywood in New York last week when their feud erupted.
The interviewer asked the couple if season two of their reality TV show The Baldwins, starring their seven children, was in the works.
Footage uploaded on TikTok showed Hilaria taking a moment to answer before Alec quipped that the series was ""the Hilaria show.""
She appeared to brush his comment off, saying: ""No, no, I think we're going to see, you know, we're going to see how it feels to be out there.""
""It's going to be great; you're a winner,"" Alec chimed in.
Hilaria, visibly annoyed, put her hands up as she told her husband not to speak when she answered questions.
""Oh my god, when I'm talking, you're not talking,"" she said.
Alec responded, ""I'm sorry,"" to which Hilaria doubled down and said, ""No, when I'm talking, you're not talking.""
""This is why, yes, we'll have to just cut him out of the show,"" she told the camera, creating a barrier from him with her hands.
""No, I mean, this is a really raw show, and it's very real, and we took a lot of chances.""
At that moment, Alec moved behind his wife, seemingly opting out of the interview as Hilaria continued.
""And you know, I think we'll see where it leads us, we'll see what it feels like to be out there, and then we'll see, you know if people like it,"" she said.
Fans quickly flooded X after the moment went viral, with one person saying, ""That was painful to watch"".
""Damn. I would not want to be in his shoes. How emasculating and embarrassing,"" another person said.
""I’m with her on this one. Why should he just talk over her?"" one more person said.
A fourth person claimed the spat was an orchestrated tactic to garner more attention to their show.
""I'm a little suspicious. They now have a reality show on TLC. I'm wondering if this was done on purpose to create interest so people will tune in,"" they said.
It comes after many critics described The Baldwins series as inauthentic, with Variety branding the show as strange and saying it was like ""being trapped on a vacation with someone else's family and watching with creeping horror as they get on each other's nerves.""
The first episode of The Baldwins premiered on TLC last month and received a critical response for its handling of the Rust shooting incident.
Warner Bros. Discovery’s US TV networks chief creative officer Howard Lee said the Baldwins ""needed this show"" when asked if the series was about telling Alec's side of what happened in court with the Rust trial.
""What was happening in the courtroom wasn’t really what it was about for us,"" Lee told Vulture last month.
""It was about what was going on at home: How were they emotionally feeling about this roller-coaster journey they were on, and would they express it to us?
""I think they needed this show. I think they feel misunderstood. They really wanted a platform on which they can voice what’s on their minds. This was the way to finally go about it for them.""
Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer last July dismissed Alec's voluntary manslaughter trial after he denied pulling the trigger of a gun which fired a single bullet at 42-year-old cinematographer Halyna Hutchins, killing her and injuring director Joel Souza on the set of the Rust film in 2021.
Judge Sommer threw the case out based on police and prosecutors' misconduct in withholding ammunition evidence from the defence.
In January, Baldwin filed a lawsuit for malicious prosecution and civil rights violations against those involved in pursuing the charge.
The lawsuit alleges prosecutors intentionally concealed evidence that would absolve Baldwin from blame and ""sought at every turn to scapegoat"" him to ""maliciously bring about or advance"" the actor's trial and conviction, and claims defendants were ""blinded by their desire to convict Baldwin for all the wrong reasons"".",SKY News,lifestyle
'Playacting at something they didn't earn': Hollywood star Justine Bateman unleashes on Meghan Markle and Prince Harry,Reilly Sullivan,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/celebrity-life/playacting-at-something-they-didnt-earn-hollywood-star-justine-bateman-unleashes-on-meghan-markle-and-prince-harry/news-story/74202ed59e3a7dd737f5ba947d8a5026,"Actress Justine Bateman has unleashed on Prince Harry and Meghan Markle once again after previously slamming the ex-working royals as “disaster tourists”.
Bateman, who is best known for her roles on shows like Family Ties and Desperate Housewives, has emerged as one of the Sussexes’ toughest critics in tinsel town since criticising the couple’s response to the Los Angeles wildfires.
The 59-year-old actress made international headlines in January after labelling the former working royals “ambulance chasers” who were allegedly using the tragedy for personal publicity.
On Sunday, Bateman hit out at the couple again for taking “every opportunity” for publicity despite “bemoaning” about a lack of privacy.
""The public doesn't want to listen to people who bemoaned their lack of privacy, and yet take every opportunity to be extremely public with whatever they're doing,” Bateman wrote via her Race Track Substack blog.
“The problem with Meghan Markle (and her husband, Harry) is that every opportunity they have explored or exploited over the past few years has been due to their very aggressive Victim Olympics campaign.
“The difference between doing that two years ago and doing it now is immense.
“It’s 2025, and no one wants to see victims anymore.”
Bateman, who is the elder sister of A-list actor Jason Bateman, also took aim at Markle’s new cooking and lifestyle program for Netflix.
“No one wants to watch someone playact at something they didn’t earn,” she wrote.
The harsh feedback comes days after Netflix “renewed” Markle’s program on the back of tepid critical reviews but strong viewing figures.
Entitled “With Love, Meghan”, the eight-part series sees Markle invite famous guests over to share cooking, gardening and hosting tips and is produced under the Sussexes’ Archewell company banner.
While both Netflix and Markle described the series as “renewed”, a production insider at Netflix told the Daily Mail that the “second” season of With Love, Meghan was filmed “back-to-back” with the first batch of episodes last year.
“I know they filmed the shows back-to-back,' the insider said.
“So, in theory there is no second season. It’s like with lots of Netflix shows, it is already in the bag at the same time as the first one.
“What this does is allow edits to be made to the show from feedback from press and Netflix viewers, so no, the overall contract hasn’t been renewed yet.”",SKY News,lifestyle
'Thank you for the thoughtfulness': Queen Mary of Denmark expresses gratitude after mystery illness forces her to withdraw from public duties,Chloe Walker,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/celebrity-life/thank-you-for-the-thoughtfulness-queen-mary-of-denmark-expresses-gratitude-after-illness-forces-her-to-withdraw-from-public-duties/news-story/1cbbeab26c9c48f596fb176091eb1dd6,"Tasmanian-born Queen Mary of Denmark has been struck down by an undisclosed illness, preventing her from attending several events close to her heart.
The 53-year-old monarch was scheduled to attend an event with the Mary Foundation at the University of Copenhagen on Friday, but the engagement was cancelled.
She was also unable to attend the Heart Association's awards ceremony at the Hotel d'Angleterre in Copenhagen on Wednesday.
On Friday evening, Mary shared a heartfelt message thanking those who had sent well wishes during her illness.
Posting to the Danish Royal Family’s official Instagram account, the mother-of-four shared an image of a handmade get-well card and flowers sent by twins Alma and Ellen, whom she was due to meet at the Heart Association awards.
""Thank you for the thoughtfulness,"" Mary wrote.
""What a lovely surprise to receive this bouquet and drawings, even though illness prevented me from participating in the Heart Association's event 'Sammen om hjertet'.""
The Queen said she had been looking forward to presenting the Heart Award with Alma and Ellen and meeting other young people living with heart disease.
""Hopefully we can meet another time,"" she said.
As a patron of the Danish Heart Association, Mary also congratulated healthcare workers at Denmark's three largest children's heart clinics for receiving the Heart Award 2025.
""Thank you and to all those who make a difference in the field of the heart every day,"" she added, signing off as H.M. The Queen.
While the nature of Mary's illness remains unclear, the Danish Royal House's Communications Department told B.T. news,"" Her Majesty the Queen, like many others right now, has become ill, and therefore unfortunately cannot participate in the Heart Association’s award ceremony.""
As Mary rested, King Frederik X carried on royal duties, attending the Royal Life Guard's Annual Day Parade at Rosenborg Castle on Friday.
He also presented the prestigious King’s Watch award to a royal life guard.
Frederik, 56, has an extensive military background, beginning his service in 1986 with the Queen's Life Guard Regiment.
He was one of only four recruits out of 300 to complete the rigorous training for the Royal Danish Navy Frogman Corps.
Over the years, he qualified as a naval officer, attended flight school, became an air force pilot, and ultimately reached the rank of major general in the army and air force, as well as rear admiral in the navy.
Meanwhile, Queen Mary and King Frederik's eldest son, Crown Prince Christian, recently began his compulsory military service in Slagelse.
Last week, the 19-year-old was pictured wearing a badge that read ""Trekroner"" meaning ""Three Crowns"" during a family visit to the barracks.",SKY News,lifestyle
'Don't put it off': Heartbreaking new details about Formula 1 icon Eddie Jordan's death after 'aggressive' cancer battle,Reilly Sullivan,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/celebrity-life/dont-put-it-off-heartbreaking-new-details-about-formula-1-icon-eddie-jordans-death-after-aggressive-cancer-battle/news-story/884c23a08a98f2f6e73c3d4328610c27,"Eddie Jordan shared a sombre warning to his fans to “look after” their bodies just months before the Formula 1 icon died from “aggressive” bladder and prostate cancer at the age of 76.
The late Jordan team owner’s family confirmed his death on Thursday at his home in Cape Town, South Africa.
“It is with profound sadness that we announce the passing of Eddie Jordan OBE, the ex-Formula 1 team owner, TV pundit and entrepreneur,” his family said in a statement.
""EJ brought an abundance of charisma, energy and Irish charm everywhere he went.”
Jordan was diagnosed with bladder and prostate cancer in 2024 but only confirmed his diagnosis to fans in December via his Formula For Success podcast.
“We've kind of alluded to it over the shows,” he said in the podcast episode.
“Way back in March and April, I was diagnosed with bladder and prostate cancer, and then it spread into the spine and the pelvis, so it was quite aggressive.”
In an urgent warning to listeners, the racing legend added that anyone experiencing symptoms should see a doctor.
“Don't put it off,” he said.
“Go and get tested, because in life, you've got chances.
“Don't be stupid. Don't be shy. Look after your body, guys.”
Bladder cancer is the eleventh most common form of cancer diagnosed in Australia and over 3,000 Aussies are diagnosed each year.
The most common symptom is blood in the urine and the cancer can often be successfully treated if caught early.
Born in Dublin in 1948, Jordan entered the fast-paced world of British motorsport in the 1970s and competed in Formula Ford, the Irish Formula Ford Championship and Formula Three.
The Irishman found greater success off the grid as the founder and team principal of his own Formula 1 team Jordan in 1991.
The team would go on to win four Grand Prix races across 15 seasons in the sport and finishing third in the 1999 World Constructors' Championship ahead of the likes of rivals Williams, Benetton and Sauber.
Jordan was where future legend Michael Schumacher got his first Formula 1 seat and also employed the likes of Damon Hill, Martin Brundle and Rubens Barrichello.
The team was ultimately sold in 2005 at which time it ceased to use the “Jordan” name, later racing under the names Spyker, Force India and Racing Point.
Since 2023, the former Jordan team has officially raced under the name Aston Martin Aramco F1 Team.",SKY News,lifestyle
"King Charles asked Meghan Markle to 'stay away' from Queen Elizabeth II's deathbed to avoid family conflict, royal author claims",Isabella Rayner,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/celebrity-life/king-charles-asked-meghan-markle-to-stay-away-from-queen-elizabeth-iis-deathbed-to-avoid-family-conflict-royal-author-claims/news-story/8ab4c2fa81c9693bf0b862012bdbd23f,"King Charles asked Meghan Markle to stay away from Queen Elizabeth's II's deathbed to avoid family conflict, a royal author has claimed.
Prince Harry and Meghan were in the UK for the annual WellChild ceremony when the Queen died at Balmoral Castle in Scotland on September 8, 2022 aged 96.
The Duke, 40 and Duchess of Sussex, 43, had reportedly always planned to attend Harry's grandmother's deathbed together.
However, when it came time, a sudden ""change of plans"" saw Harry journey to Scotland to meet with his immediate family without Meghan.
Then-Prince Charles called Harry and Prince William and urged his sons to travel to Scotland immediately to say their goodbyes to the Queen.
It's understood Charles believed his mother still had days to live and wanted his family to say goodbye without engaging in trivial arguments.
Robert Hardman, author of Charles III: New King, New Court, The Inside Story, claimed Charles therefore wanted Meghan to stay away so as to avoid conflict.
It's alleged Princess Catherine also stayed in the UK with the Wales' children, Prince George, Princess Charlotte, and Prince Louis, not because she wasn't asked to attend.
Instead, the Princess of Wales reportedly wanted to support the young royals during their first day at Lambrook School.
Her decision was allegedly used as an excuse and helped calm Harry when he was told Meghan was to stay away from Balmoral.
""Meg and I looked at flight options. The press started phoning; we couldn't delay a decision any longer. We told our team to confirm: We'd be missing the WellChild Awards and hurrying up to Scotland,"" the renegade royal wrote in his memoir Spare.
""Then came another call from Pa. He said I was welcome at Balmoral, but he didn't want…her.
""He started to lay out his reason, which was nonsensical, and disrespectful, and I wasn't having it. 'Don't ever speak about my wife that way'.
""He stammered, apologetic, saying he simply didn't want a lot of people around. No other wives were coming, Kate wasn't coming, he said, therefore Meg shouldn't. Then that's all you needed to say.""
The Queen's death came after Meghan, in the Sussexes 2021 interview with Oprah Winfrey, said she had been feeling suicidal and claimed there were ""conversations"" within the firm about Prince Archie's skin colour.
After senior royals and palace aides deliberated for two days on how to handle the public furore following the interview, the Queen issued a short statement.
“The whole family is saddened to learn the full extent of how challenging the last few years have been for Harry and Meghan,"" the statement read.
""The issues raised, particularly that of race, are concerning. While some recollections may vary, they are taken very seriously and will be addressed by the family privately.
“Harry, Meghan and Archie will always be much-loved family members.”

'Lost my identity': Princess Tatiana of Greece makes heartbreaking statement after ex-husband's shock wedding to shipping heiress,Reilly Sullivan,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/celebrity-life/lost-my-identity-princess-tatiana-of-greece-makes-heartbreaking-statement-after-exhusbands-shock-wedding-to-shipping-heiress/news-story/75bda4c7a9f24194bb5dabad39d508b3,"Greece’s Princess Tatiana has broken her silence just weeks after her ex-husband Prince Nikolaos married for the second time in Athens.
The Venezuelan-born Princess, previously known as Tatiana Blatnik, became a member of the exiled Greek monarchy upon her marriage to the “Playboy Prince” in 2010.
However, the couple announced their surprise split in 2024 and Nikolaos remarried a Greek shipping heiress last month less than a year after divorcing Tatiana.
On Thursday, Tatiana appeared to address her sudden divorce for the first time since Nikolaos’ royal wedding.
""Last year, I lost another layer of identity,"" she wrote in an Instagram post.
""But maybe identity isn't something we lose, it's something we evolve, rediscover, and redefine.""
The 44-year-old said she was now ""taking a step back before moving forward"".
""This month I will be traveling to some of the places that have shaped me. Seeking the stories, the people & moments that have made me who I am. I'm excited about this and looking forward to sharing it with all of you.""
Her words come a month after her former in-laws gathered in Athens as Nikolaos married Chrysí Vardinogianni, with members of the Spanish and Danish royal families also attending the celebrations.
Ms Vardinogianni wowed in a champagne coloured gown by Christos Costarellos and wore her new mother-in-law Queen Anne-Marie's Antique Corsage Tiara.
The Corsage Tiara was created in 1964 and is made from diamonds and pearls with a magnificent pearl topper.
Awkwardly, the heirloom was also worn by Tatiana and the wives of Nikolaos' two brothers on their wedding days.
The Prince’s relationship with shipping heiress Chrysí, a family friend, was only revealed to the public in January when their impending wedding was announced.
Nikolaos, 55, is the son of the late King Constantine of Greece and Queen Anne-Marie of Greece and Denmark.
The Greek Prince was famously at the Slip Inn pub in Sydney with his cousin on the night Frederik met his future wife Mary Donaldson during the 2000 Summer Olympics.
The Greek royal later attended Frederik’s wedding to Mary in 2004 and the Danish royals were also front and centre at Nikolaos’ first wedding to Tatiana.
Despite Frederik and Mary’s close relationship with Nikolaos, neither the King nor Queen were among the roughly 50 guests at the wedding.",SKY News,lifestyle
'Shut that mouth': Kyle Sandilands calls out ex-Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull for doing Australia 'dirty' over comments against Donald Trump as tariff war escalates,Chloe Walker,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/celebrity-life/shut-that-mouth-kyle-sandilands-calls-out-exprime-minister-malcolm-turnbull-for-doing-australia-dirty-over-comments-against-donald-trump-as-tariff-war-escalates/news-story/39cbd59cc31e48b6ad4e8a3c65607682,"Radio shock jock Kyle Sandilands has weighed in on the escalating tariff war, taking aim at Malcolm Turnbull and accusing the former prime minister of undermining Australia’s trade interests.
On Tuesday, US President Donald Trump rejected Australia's bid for an exemption from new tariffs on aluminium and steel after a war of words with Turnbull.
The former Liberal leader had criticised Trump's leadership on Bloomberg TV, saying his ""erratic"" behaviour was pushing countries towards China.
""President Xi will aim to be the exact opposite of Trump… Where Trump is chaotic, he will be consistent. Where Trump is rude and abusive, he'll be respectful,"" he said.
Trump fired back on Truth Social, calling Turnbull a ""weak and ineffective leader"" who ""never understood"" China.
Speaking on ABC's 7.30 program on Monday, Turnbull doubled down, accusing Australia's political class of ""bipartisan gaslighting"" over Trump's economic policies.
Sandilands told listeners on Wednesday morning that Turnbull should have stayed out of the matter.
""Not great that Malcolm Turnbull, our former prime minister, got in the middle of this tariffs war,"" Sandilands said.
""The guy is not even prime minister. He should sit back, retire and keep quiet. Shut that mouth.
""Because now Trump is not going to give us the aluminium and steel sort of pass that he gave us last time.""
Sandilands noted that Turnbull, who secured a tariff exemption from Trump during his first Presidency in 2018, may have now cost Prime Minister Anthony Albanese the same deal.
""So now Trump has said last night no exceptions, not even Australia. So that former prime minister has done us dirty,"" Sandilands said.
""Especially people in the aluminium and steel trade.""
While acknowledging uncertainty over whether the tariffs would ultimately take effect, the 53-year-old radio host said the US believed they were necessary.
""But what we really wanted to get it down to is free trade for everyone. So, everyone prospers. I think that’s what we’re after. I know it’s boring, but that’s the answer.""
A vocal Trump supporter, Sandilands defended the President's approach.
""What Trump really wants is to have Americans treated fairly, because America’s been everyone’s policeman and grandfather and the saviour for a lot of people over the years,"" he said.
""A lot of other countries, they’ve been terrorising them.""
Sandilands argued that Trump's tariffs were about restoring fairness.
""They (the US) take everyone’s s***. But not a lot of people take their s*** back,"" he said..
""They just want it to be fair.""
This isn’t the first time Sandilands has taken aim at Turnbull.
In 2017, the shock jock accused the then-prime minister of deliberately snubbing his program in favour of lower-rating shows.
He told former opposition leader Bill Shorten that neither Turnbull nor his media team had responded to repeated interview requests.
He questioned whether Turnbull’s media team was ""doing their job properly"" and called the decision to avoid KIIS FM 106.5 ""weird"".
Shorten agreed, saying: ""It's a big call to diss you guys.""

Gwyneth Paltrow speaks out against 'critical' Hollywood on-set intimacy coordinator trend embraced by Blake Lively,Isabella Rayner,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/celebrity-life/gwyneth-paltrow-speaks-out-against-critical-hollywood-onset-intimacy-coordinator-trend-embraced-by-blake-lively/news-story/5fccb06592913953dc0e9f59710850f8,"Gwyneth Paltrow has spoken out against the Hollywood trend of hiring ""intimacy coordinators"" to choreograph sex scenes on film and TV sets - after Blake Lively called the practice ""critical"" to the industry.

The 52-year-old Goop founder spoke to Vanity Fair on Tuesday and said working with an intimacy coordinator on the set of comedy-drama Marty Supreme alongside actor Timothée Chalamet was unsettling.
Marty Supreme stars Paltrow and Chalamet as two characters who become romantically involved and is scheduled for release in December 2025.
Paltrow said she ultimately asked the intimacy coordinator on the film's set to take a step back in crafting the many sex scenes between the two.
""There’s now something called an intimacy coordinator, which I did not know existed,"" she said of her experience.
""I was like, 'Girl, I’m from the era where you get naked, you get in bed, the camera’s on'.
""I don’t know how it is for kids who are starting out, but…if someone is like, 'OK, and then he’s going to put his hand here,' I would feel, as an artist, very stifled by that.""
Paparazzi footage from Marty Supreme’s New York set revealed a moustachioed Chalamet, about 20 years Paltrow's junior, passionately grabbing and kissing the diamond-adorned actress in Central Park.
She said Chalamet, who has dated Jenner since 2023, is a very polite and fun man who was appropriately raised and takes his work seriously.
Intimacy coordinators have become prominent in productions involving intimate scenes, particularly in the wake of the #MeToo movement.
The professional liaises between actors and production about nudity and simulated sex scenes to ensure proper safety protocols are adhered to.
The Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) has also developed guidelines which encourage productions to hire intimacy coordinators, especially for such scenes.
It comes as Lively, 37,  called attention to the importance of Intimacy Coordinators working with the cast on set to choreograph those scenes ""safely.""
""I think it's critical to have an intimacy coordinator. I think that, like, you coordinate stunts, you coordinate dancing. It is, it's choreography,"" she told Digital Spy in August.
""So, to be able to say, you know, so this was what happens here, here and here in a stunt; and this is what happens here, here and here in a dance. But, like, now you guys just go...put your bodies together and your mouths and whatever.
""And just like, action and cut...that's sort of ridiculous. So I think that that being choreographed is critical for everyone's safety.""
Lively filed a lawsuit against her It Ends With Us co-star Justin Baldoni in December, accusing him of sexual harassment and creating a ""hostile work environment on set"".
Baldoni, 41 returned serve with his own US$400million (AU$632million) filing against the actress and her husband Ryan Reynolds in January.
Baldoni's lawsuit alleges Lively and Reynolds hijacked both the production and marketing of It Ends With Us, and manipulated media to smear Baldoni and others on the production with false allegations of harassment.
The lawsuit also claims Lively used Baldoni as a scapegoat for her ""publicly tainted image"" and leveraged ""her power as a wealthy celebrity to take creative control of the film"".
Responding to the filing at the time, Lively's lawyers, Manatt, Phelps & Phillips and Willkie Farr & Gallagher accused Baldoni and his team of using a DARVO tactic, which stands for ""deny, attack, reverse victim and offender"".
""This is an age-old story: A woman speaks up with concrete evidence of sexual harassment and retaliation, and the abuser attempts to turn the tables on the victim. This is what experts call DARVO,"" their statement said.

The former actress and tabloid regular largely quit showbiz more than a decade ago to marry billionaire British property developer Nick Candy in 2012.
The couple have since had two children together and live in London, where the former Kiss Kiss singer and FHM cover girl is now part of the capital’s elite high society.
In 2018, Holly and Nick were even among the high-profile guests at Princess Eugenie’s royal wedding at Windsor Chapel.
On Saturday, Driza-Bone marked International Women’s Day with a stunning new shot of the former singer decked out in one of the label’s iconic wax jackets, which was shared via their official Instagram account.
“Raising a Glass to Authentic Aussie Women. Happy IWD,” the brand wrote in the caption.
“Wherever you are in the world, today we celebrate the strength, spirit, and resilience of the women we love.
“Thank you, @hollyvalance, for raising your glass to women everywhere—and to Driza-Bone, an Aussie icon built on heritage, grit, and timeless style.""
The heritage Aussie brand was created in 1898 and is famous for its premium outerwear inspired by workwear for stockmen.
The new gig comes about a year after Valance opened up about her right wing political beliefs for the first time, including her support for US President Donald Trump and former British Prime Minister Liz Truss.
Valance, who played the role of Felicity Scully on the hit TV series Neighbours from 1999 to 2002, has subsequently slammed her homeland for embracing “woke” politics.
“The Australia I grew up in was unreal, it was so fun. We didn’t seem to have all these problems,” Vallance told GB News in 2024.

The 41-year-old former world No. 4 took to Instagram on Wednesday to post a side-by-side comparison of her before-and-after weight loss.
In her before photo, Jelena cuts a casual figure as she walks across a tennis court wearing a linen dress.
The next photo shows the sports star wearing a glamorous cobalt blue suit and white shirt, which accentuated her new slimmed-down look.
In the caption, Jelena said the difference between the two photos was ""nothing except what you see on the outside, my BODY SIZE.""
""I am the same hardworking person, respectful, generous, empathetic, compassionate, humble, kind, driven, strong, resilient, capable and loving person, woman and friend,"" she wrote.
""What really matters is not different.""
""So never judge anyone by their size or outside appearance; instead, appreciate and focus on what is on the inside.
Jelena also said beauty is not conducive to a person's aesthetic appearance but rather to ""how you are as a person.""
""It’s how you make others feel, especially about themselves. No beauty shines brighter than that of a kind heart,"" she wrote.
""So, let your eyes see souls and not bodies. And never body shame anyone.""
Fans flooded the comments section with their support for Jelena, with one person calling to end body shaming.
""You are beautiful courageous warrior woman inside and out. Body shaming can go in the bin where it belongs!!!"" they said.
""So true—you are wonderful inside and out. But gee, I have to say you look very happy and healthy, Jelena. Blue is definitely gorgeous on you,"" another person said.
""You look beautiful in blue…..regardless of the outfit and size,"" a third person said.
One more fan said Jelena's candid words proved she had ""all kinds of heart"".
At the height of her tennis career in 2002, Jelena ranked world no. 4 despite losing to Elena Bovina in the second round of the US Open.
She professionally retired from the sport in 2014 after struggling with poor form and injuries but remained in the Australian tennis media.
However, the star was subject to online trolling over her appearance, particularly after she covered the Australian Open in 2023.
The harassment spurred Jelena to wage a public campaign and call out the slew of trolls who targeted her weight and body-shamed her.
At the time, she took to Instagram to share a comment from a troll who referred to her as a ""whale.""
""I don't think it's fair that a whale like Jelena Dokic takes my joy of watching tennis and turns it to crap"", the comment read.
Jelena has said some of the comments about her weight and appearance affected her mental health, having suffered from depression, anxiety, PTSD and an eating disorder since around age 21.
The Croatian-born star's family sought refuge in Australia when Jelena was 11, and she has spoken of growing up in poverty with her abusive father and tennis coach Damir Dokic.
In a December 2023 interview, Jelena said she has been estranged from Damir for more than 10 years, and he has never apologised for his alleged verbal, emotional, and physical abuse.
Jelena detailed her father's alleged abuse, said to have occurred regularly throughout her childhood and during her career, in her 2024 autobiography, Unbreakable.",SKY News,lifestyle
Fresh autopsy report reveals heartbreaking cause behind actor Gene Hackman's dog's death after body partially mummified,Sumaiya Chowdhure,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/celebrity-life/fresh-autopsy-report-reveals-heartbreaking-cause-behind-actor-gene-hackmans-dogs-death-after-body-partially-mummified/news-story/5c83514f0507b9898dbd0e567c0d1fcf,"A new autopsy report has revealed the likely cause of Gene Hackman's beloved dog's death alongside himself and wife Betsy Arakawa in their New Mexico home, earlier last month.
According to the report from the state Department of Agriculture’s veterinary lab, the dog which was an Australian kelpie mix named Zinfandel or ""Zinna"", died from dehydration and starvation.
It is understood the dog's stomach was mostly empty except for small amounts of hair and bile.
While partial mummification obscured some organs of the dog, there was no additional evidence to suggest infectious disease, trauma or poisoning could have resulted in the pet's sudden death.
The kelpie mix was found dead in a crate in a bathroom closet near Arakawa's body, while the couple's two other dogs survived.
The two surviving dogs allegedly helped officers find Hackman's body after they searched his home for more than 30 minutes, Fire Chief Brian Moya told USA Today earlier this month.
The actor's body was found in the home's entryway, while his musician wife of 24 years was found in the bathroom, next to an orange prescription pill bottle.
Both bodies were reportedly decomposing due to the especially dry climate in Santa Fe.
Police had previously ruled out any external trauma to the couple but launched an investigation into the suspicious circumstances surrounding their deaths.
Last week, authorities confirmed Hackman died from ""significant"" heart disease with added complications from advanced Alzheimer’s disease about a week after a rare disease — hantavirus pulmonary syndrome — claimed the life of his wife.
Hackman suffering from Alzheimer's was apparently unaware of his wife's death.
While the exact time of Hackman's death could not be determined, Dr Heather Jarrell from the New Mexico Medical Investigator's Office pointed to the actor's pacemaker which stopped recording cardiac activity on February 18.
Santa Fe County Sheriff Adan Mendoza outlined Arakawa's final days, revealing on February 9 she had picked up one of her dogs - later found dead - which had undergone a procedure.
Then two days later she emailed her therapist and visited a market.
That same day she was spotted on CCTV at a pharmacy and pet food shop.
Dr Jarrell concluded it was likely that Arakawa died on February 11, one week before her husband, given there had been no other communication from the 63-year-old musician.",SKY News,lifestyle

Denmark’s royal palace confirmed that Mary, who completes hundreds of engagements each year, was forced to cancel the engagements due to a mystery illness but declined to provide further details.
The Queen resumed her official duties on Tuesday and appeared in high spirits as she toured a local school in Vallensbæk outside Copenhagen.
In new photos shared by the Danish palace, Mary can be seen greeting students and accepting handwritten notes from well wishers.
“It has been a pleasure to experience Pilehaveskolen’s work with the School Force,” Mary said in a statement shared via the official royal Instagram account.
“The school’s experiences and the student council’s proposals once again emphasise to me how central it is to involve children and young people in issues about their everyday lives.
“They are the ones who experience it firsthand if the well-being in the classroom is poor and if bullying occurs.”
Mary opted for a dark monochrome look for the appearance and paired a dark plaid coat with a matching turtleneck and dark jeans.
The glamorous royal wore her long hair down and completed the look with simple gold hoop earrings.
Mary's return comes weeks after the Queen and King Frederik reunited with their son Crown Prince Christian for the first time since the Danish heir began mandatory military service.
The entire Danish royal family travelled to a remote military barracks earlier this month to visit Christian, including the Prince’s siblings Princess Isabella, 17, and twins Prince Vincent and Princess Josephine, 14.
Both Frederik and his Tasmanian-born wife looked emotional as they hugged their son and met his follow recruits in the Guard Hussar Regiment.
Denmark’s constitution stipulates every male over the age of 18 completes mandatory national service, which usually spans between four months and a year.
From 2027 onwards, women will also be required to complete national service amid rising tensions with Russia and United States President Donald Trump’s desire to acquire Greenland.
Noticeably, Isabella was shown trying on her brother’s military gear in one of the official photos in a possible sign the Princess will also complete national service.
It is understood that Christian will complete at least three more months of military training before returning to his gilded life inside Amalienborg Palace.",SKY News,lifestyle
"Newly single Isla Fisher 'feeling spoiled' after revealing new $10,750 diamond necklace following split from Sacha Baron Cohen",Reilly Sullivan,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/celebrity-life/newly-single-isla-fisher-feeling-spoiled-after-revealing-new-10750-diamond-necklace-following-split-from-sacha-baron-cohen/news-story/898b0826b1780a6ada0e5f2e826267be,"Isla Fisher has showed off her new diamond necklace after returning to Australia following her split from longtime partner Sacha Baron Cohen.
The former couple, who share three children, previously split their time between homes in Sydney, London and Los Angeles after their 2010 wedding in Paris.
Fisher, 49, and Baron Cohen, 53, announced their separation in April last year via a joint statement on social media.
""After a long tennis match lasting over 20 years, we are finally putting our racquets down,"" the former couple wrote alongside a photo of themselves in tennis whites.
On Wednesday, the Wedding Crashers star shared an Instagram story of a diamond necklace from contemporary brand Harkness with the caption “feeling spoiled”.
The dazzling necklace is made in yellow gold and round diamonds and is currently for sale on the brand’s website for the eye-watering price of $10,750.
“Each diamond bar is set with stones on all four sides, meticulously designed to sparkle with every movement of the body,” the brand wrote in the production description.
The Aussie movie star, 49, is currently on the Gold Coast filming a movie called Spa Weekend also starring Leslie Mann, Michelle Buteau and Anna Faris.
Fisher and her co-stars were recently forced to “hunker down” after Cyclone Alfred battered the region earlier this month.
The former Home And Away actress has also recently consolidated her property portfolio after selling off an apartment in Sydney’s upscale Woollahra.
Fisher reportedly paid just $171,500 for the two-bedroom, one-bathroom apartment in the late Art Deco block Wiltshire Towers back in 1995 and unloaded the property for a rumoured $930,000.
It is understood the movie star, who is still reportedly finalising her divorce settlement from Baron Cohen, no longer owns property in the country after the Woollahra sale.",SKY News,lifestyle
'A spectacular story': Jimmy Barnes' secret love child Katy Lee Carroll reveals how she learned the Scottish-Australian rocker was her father,Chloe Walker,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/celebrity-life/a-spectacular-story-jimmy-barnes-secret-love-child-katy-lee-carroll-reveals-how-she-learned-the-scottishaustralian-rocker-was-her-father/news-story/08dd611f1dd13a755373dcaaba20526b,"The manner in which the 37-year-old secret love child of Scottish-Aussie rocker Jimmy Barnes uncovered her father's true identity can now be revealed.
Katy Lee Carroll, from Coffs Harbour, New South Wales, was introduced to the world in December when Barnes, 68, shared photos of her on Instagram just days before Christmas.
""Christmas is all about family, and we would like to introduce my daughter Katy Lee, who has been in our lives for the past five years,"" Barnes wrote.
""Katy is a wonderful woman, and since discovering that I was her biological father, our family and extended family have loved getting to know her.""
Katy Lee, a sales associate at Stone Real Estate, shared her own post, writing: ""Five years ago, I found out that my biological father is Jimmy Barnes.
""While this journey has brought up some complex emotions, it has also been an extraordinary gift to be welcomed into such a talented and kind family.""
While neither Carroll nor Barnes initially disclosed how they came into each other's lives, Daily Mail Australia this week revealed they first met on 7 February 2020 in Kingscliff, a coastal town near Carroll's home.
Barnes had travelled north with his wife of 44 years, Jane Mahoney, ahead of his performance with Cold Chisel at A Day on the Green in Mount Cotton, south-east of Brisbane.
Carroll's husband, AJ Gilbert, and their two daughters also attended the dinner before watching Barnes open the concert the following night.
Carroll, now a mother of three and a sales associate at Stone Real Estate, said she hesitated before reaching out to the Barnes family.
Discovering she was the rock star's eighth child meant accepting she was conceived six years into his marriage to Jane.
For most of her life, she believed her father was a road worker named Ian.
But on her 32nd birthday in September 2019, her mother, Suzanne Betty Boon, told her the truth: her biological father was Jimmy Barnes.
Barnes, who has four children aged 35 to 42 with Jane, is also the father of Today Extra host David Campbell, 51, who was born when the singer was a teenager.
He also fathered two daughters in his youth, Amanda Bennett and Megan Torzyn, both in their early 50s.
Before meeting Barnes and Jane, Carroll wrote a ""deeply personal letter"" to ease any tension.
She was particularly mindful of Jane's feelings but was immediately ""embraced"" by the family ""with love, warmth and incredible understanding.""
A friend of Carroll's said now that the story is public, it's time for people to learn more about her journey.
""Katy has a very spectacular story, and she shares many traits with her father,"" the friend said.
""She’s open about her childhood struggles and is proud of what she has achieved despite the challenges she faced.
""She is truly a beautiful and remarkable person.""
While Carroll's connection to Barnes only became widely known last year, she had already been part of the family for some time.
Her Instagram features photos with Barnes, Jane, and her half siblings.
In November, she posted a picture with Barnes and her brother Jackie, captioning it ""Blessed"" with a heart emoji.
Meanwhile, Barnes, who has been battling health issues, recently announced his return to live performances, with the DEFIANT tour kicking off on 7 June.",SKY News,lifestyle
Olympic breakdancer Raygun sells her official signed Team Australia Paris 2024 shirt on eBay for charity - and gets an outrageous price for it,Isabella Rayner,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/celebrity-life/olympic-breakdancer-raygun-sells-her-official-signed-team-australia-paris-2024-shirt-on-ebay-for-charity-and-gets-an-outrageous-price-for-it/news-story/f6893c709b6f1d07b08d8b4b19f5ec8c,"Controversial breakdancer Rachael 'Raygun' Gunn has sold her official signed Team Australia Paris 2024 Olympic Games shirt on eBay for almost $2000.
The 37-year-old's green and gold ASICS-designed shirt features her handwritten signature scrawled on the front and sold on the international website for $1860 on Wednesday after more than 45 bids.
The shirt is not the same green number Raygun sported at her viral breakdancing competition at the Olympics last year.
The sport's debut at the Olympic level saw Raygun perform Australian-inspired moves like a hopping kangaroo and the sprinkler, which were parodied worldwide.
Raygun took to Instagram on Wednesday to announce the proceeds from her sale will go towards raising funds for the Bunyip preschool and daycare service in the NSW community of Harden after a hailstorm.
""I can't believe my signed shirt sold for this much!!"" Raygun wrote over a screenshot of the sale.
""Thank you to everyone who shared and supported. We're that much closer to getting Bunyip Preschool/Daycare back up and running.""
Wind, rain, and heavy hail smashed the preschool in February, and the building was subsequently closed for repairs.
Due to the extent of the damage, the repairs could take up to 12 months to complete.
Operations have meanwhile been moved to a nearby Harden Showgrounds until around October.
Raygun is based in Sydney but has a close connection to Harden and often visits the town to see her family and friends, including her cousin Steph Ellis, who has three children at the preschool.
She hosted a charity dance party late last month at the Harden Country Club, and all proceeds went toward rebuilding the centre.
“It’s a second home for me here,” she told a reporter at About Regional.
“I used to come here every Christmas and spend time with my family.”

In the latest twist to the bitter It Ends With Us legal saga, the X-Men star, 56, 'will be deposed' about Deadpool & Wolverine co-star and Lively's husband Ryan Reynolds' conduct during the making of the contentious 2024 film.
""As Ryan’s good friend, who...was with Blake and Ryan many times in private during that time, his deposition will likely be crucial"" an insider told the Daily Mail on Thursday.
Witnesses are questioned under oath during depositions, which are an integral part of the pre-trial discovery process.
Lively, 37, filed a lawsuit against Baldoni in December, accusing him of sexual harassment and creating a ""hostile work environment on set,"" with Baldoni, 41, returning serve with his own US$400million (AU$632million) filing against the actress and Reynolds in January.
All parties have denied the claims.
Jackman is expected to help give ""a full scope of Ryan's conduct during the time that It Ends With Us was filmed"".
Filming for their movie Deadpool & Wolverine began in May 2023, around the same time that It Ends With Us was in production.
Jackman also helped to promote It Ends With Us by attending the movie's New York City premiere with his pal Reynolds and was present when ""not-so-subtle disses"" about Baldoni allegedly took place on the set of Deadpool & Wolverine.
Baldoni's lawsuit alleges Lively and Reynolds hijacked both the production and marketing of It Ends With Us, and manipulated media to smear Baldoni and others on the production with false allegations of harassment.
The lawsuit also claims Lively used Baldoni as a scapegoat for her ""publicly tainted image"" and leveraged ""her power as a wealthy celebrity to take creative control of the film"".
Responding to the filing at the time, Lively's lawyers, Manatt, Phelps & Phillips and Willkie Farr & Gallagher, accused Baldoni and his team of using a DARVO tactic, which stands for ""deny, attack, reverse victim and offender"".
Their statement said: ""This is an age-old story: A woman speaks up with concrete evidence of sexual harassment and retaliation and the abuser attempts to turn the tables on the victim. This is what experts call DARVO.""

My Name Is Earl star Ethan Suplee reveals extraordinary weight loss transformation as the unrecognisable Hollywood star speaks about being 'broken',Isabella Rayner,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/celebrity-life/my-name-is-earl-star-ethan-suplee-reveals-extraordinary-weight-loss-transformation-as-the-unrecognisable-hollywood-star-speaks-about-being-broken/news-story/c5bd74a75aa2b27f022e64fb532a4f76,"Ethan Suplee has revealed his extraordinary weight loss transformation as the American actor spoke out about the ""broken"" parts of him.
The 48-year-old has starred in several blockbusters, including American History X, The Butterfly Effect and Remember The Titans, but is best known for his role as Randy Hickey in the sitcom My Name Is Earl.
Suplee once weighed nearly 250kg when he was 23 years old, but recently took to Instagram to share his dramatic physical transformation.
In one before photo, the actor is visibly overweight and wearing a red T-shirt as he balances a cigarette between his fingers.
Other photos understood to have been taken some years ago show a close-up of Suplee's face and hunched shoulders.
Now, the star can be seen cutting a chiselled figure as he proudly displayed his trimmed physique in a gym and filmed himself working out.
Suplee is also seen with significant muscle gain and a much slimmer-looking face than in the past.
However, the actor conceded losing weight was not the life-changing answer he once thought it would be.
""Weight loss was one of the primary focuses of my entire life,"" he wrote in the caption.
""But I considered weight loss to be the whole game. If I could lose the weight, it would solve some broken part of me. It never did.
""Weight loss was just the very first tiny step in the marathon of life. It turns out, keeping it off is a much tougher task.
""Unlike a diet, which is temporary, keeping it off is a forever pursuit.""
Fitness gurus took to the comments section to praise Suplee, with American professional wrestler Dustin Rhodes saying he was ""looking good"".
""Absolutely inspiring brother,"" personal trainer Jimmy Queen said, while Italian singer Benjamin Mascolo echoed the sentiment, simply writing: ""Inspiring"".
Retired Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) fighter Tim Kennedy said Suplee was ""such a motivator"" to his close to one million followers.
""Earl would be so proud of you, Randy,"" another fan said.
""Dude you are one of my biggest inspirations. I was 623 pounds almost a year and a half ago and I’ve busted my ass and now as of this morning I’m 351. So thank you for being awesome,"" one more person said.
The actor has been candid about his weight loss journey and documented his progress in shedding more than 100kgs in the media since 2020.
The actor credits cycling with helping him stay fit.
He once reached a record low of 9 percent body fat but ultimately gained some weight back after realising his acting opportunities could be jeopardised.
Supplee married Brandy Lewis, the younger sister of actress Juliette Lewis, in 2006 and revealed their romance inspired his health journey.
“I became, for the first time in my life, kind of interested in the future and having experiences with her,” he said on People (the TV Show!) in June 2022.
“Like spending a day walking around a museum, going on a trip or hiking that I just wasn’t physically able to do.”",SKY News,lifestyle
'Very forced': Meghan Markle's former ally Katherine Ryan turns on Duchess of Sussex after new Netflix show,Reilly Sullivan,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/celebrity-life/very-forced-meghan-markles-former-ally-katherine-ryan-turns-on-duchess-of-sussex-after-new-netflix-show/news-story/e8ee2975c5cd1d17672eb343a89fe1e4,"Comedian Katherine Ryan has revealed why she now believes Meghan Markle’s stories “don’t add up” after previously defending the Duchess of Sussex.
Canadian-born Ryan, 42, is a high profile comedian in the United Kingdom who has previously supported the Duchess of Sussex despite Markle’s low approval in the UK.
In 2022, Ryan passionately defended the Duchess of Sussex and praised the ex-working royal for “challenging the norm”.
“I love Meghan Markle’s voice and her confidence to challenge the norm and what’s expected of her in that role,” Ryan told the Daily Express newspaper at the time.
Almost three years later, Ryan revealed she now feels Markle has “lied” in her public interviews since leaving the royal family.
“I liked Meghan Markle. I was rooting for Meghan Markle... though she is very Hollywood - even for me - and I don't like that in people,” she said on Monday on her podcast Telling Everybody Everything.
“I see now, and maybe it's just the projects she's choosing, it does feel like she has lied about whether she knew who Prince Harry was, and these details about her childhood change and don't add up.”
Ryan also pointed out that Markle’s recent statements in her new Netflix cooking program, With Love Meghan, allegedly contradicted earlier claims from the Duchess of Sussex.
“She said on her new Netflix show that they ate TV dinners growing up,” she said.
“But then in an old interview, she was like, ‘we would eat farm fresh’.
“Her whole act just seems very manicured and very forced.”
The comments come after an unnamed crew member on Meghan’s cooking show praised the Duchess of Sussex for making staff “feel seen”.
""In this show, we were part of it, we were included, it was a very unique and refreshing experience,” the source told People magazine.
""One day, (Meghan) had a bespoke ice cream cart with local homemade ice cream.
“She had an acai truck for us, too. Every week, she did something like that for us. It was really lovely.""",SKY News,lifestyle
Disney's live-action premiere of Snow White looks set to be scaled back following backlash over woke themes and cast members,Preston Potts,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/celebrity-life/disneys-liveaction-premiere-of-snow-white-looks-set-to-be-scaled-back-following-backlash-over-woke-themes-and-cast-members/news-story/4f64d7a4816e22bf349b6280466e461d,"Disney looks set to scale back on the upcoming live-action adaptation premiere of Snow White following criticism over ""woke"" decisions and the cast starring in the film.
The Hollywood screening of Snow White will be scaled back when it's shown at Los Angeles' El Capitan Theatre in March 15, starring Rachel Zegler and Gal Gadot.
Variety revealed the reinvented film will be merely behind closed doors, limited to photographers and a house crew.
After Disney spent upwards of $269.4 million to reinvent Snow White, there has been criticism over the ""woke"" remake which has been prioritised, rather than authentic storytelling.
Fans noticed Disney's woke priorities from the original film, where traditional romance was dumped for being too ""sexist"" and the Seven Dwarfs were now seen as a diverse group of ""magical creatures"" of all heights, race and gender.
In early March, a source told the Daily Mail Disney would scale back media access for the Snow White premiere amid heightened anti-woke backlash.
""Disney is already anticipating an anti-woke backlash against Snow White and have reduced the media schedule to just a handful of tightly controlled press events,"" the insider revealed.
""That is why they have taken the highly unusual step not to host a London premiere for the film and are minimising the amount of press questions that Rachel Zegler gets.""
Others questioned Snow White for being played by Zegler due to her being Latino and her own remarks, such as her calling the original 1937 film ""dated"" because the prince ""literally stalks Snow White"".
""The original cartoon came out in 1937, and very evidently so,"" she told Extra TV back in 2022.
""There's a big focus on her love story with a guy who literally stalks her. Weird. So we didn't do that this time.
""I was scared of the original version. I think I watched it once and never picked it up again. I'm being so serious.""
Zegler has previously told Variety her intention for the new Snow White was for her to dream about becoming a ""fearless leader"" rather than ""dreaming about true love"".
The Marc Webb-directed film is set to hit the big screen on March 20.
The official trailer for the film has surpassed 11 million views since debuting on December 4.",SKY News,lifestyle

Furler, 49, and Dan Bernad wed in Portofino, Italy in a small ceremony back in May 2023 at the home of legendary fashion designers Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana.
According to court documents obtained by People magazine, the Adelaide native, born Sia Kate Isobelle Furler, separated from Bernad just one day before she filed for divorce on Tuesday.
The filings also revealed the couple secretly welcomed their first child together just one year ago.
Court documents state that Sia and Bernad welcomed a baby named ""Somersault Wonder Bernad"" on March 27, 2024.
The singer already has two adult sons who she adopted as a single parent from the American foster system in 2019 when both boys were already teenagers.
According to People, the ""Chandelier"" singer is requesting legal and physical custody of Somersault, although she is open to granting Bernad visitation rights.
The music star, who is worth a reported $30 million USD, is also asking the court not to award her former husband any spousal support.
Furler is one of the most prolific hitmakers in the music industry and topped the Billboard charts with her hits “Chandelier”, “Elastic Heart” and “Titanium”.
The nine-time Grammy nominee has also penned number one songs for other major artists, including Rihanna’s “Diamonds”.
Despite her high-profile music career, Sia has maintained a relatively low profile and often shields her face behind wigs and large hats during public appearances.
The hitmaker is also notoriously private about her personal life.
Sia was previously married to filmmaker Erik Anders Lang for two years before their divorce in 2016.
The musician opened up about the demise of her first marriage in a rare interview with Apple Music in 2023 where she revealed she suffered bouts of depression following the split.
""I got divorced and that really threw me for a loop,” Furler said.
“That was such a dark time that I was in bed for three years, really, really severely depressed.
“I couldn't really do anything for that period of time.""",SKY News,lifestyle
'Looked exactly like a store-bought one': Eagle eyed fans spot suspicious detail in Meghan's St Patrick's Day waffles,Reilly Sullivan,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/celebrity-life/looked-exactly-like-a-storebought-one-eagle-eyed-fans-spot-suspicious-detail-in-meghans-st-patricks-day-waffles/news-story/275843ef3e6b2da2e0f8c55f520e91b3,"Meghan Markle has been accused of staging her own homemade St Patrick's Day waffles after eagle eyed viewers noticed some suspicious details in the finish product.
While the Prince and Princess celebrated Ireland's patron saint by visiting armed forces personnel, Markle marked the holiday by making a St Patricks-themed breakfast at her Montecito mansion.
The 43-year-old Duchess of Sussex posted a series of Instagram videos that showed her apparently using a waffle maker to create a Shamrock green holiday-themed breakfast to celebrate with her family.
Markle filmed herself whipping up a bright green mixture, before pouring it into a steaming hot black cast-iron waffle maker with the caption “love a theme!”.
The Duchess revealed that she made multiple batches of the shamrock waffles for her husband Prince Harry as well as their children Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet.
However, eagle-eyed social media users immediately claimed there was something suspicious about the green waffles.
Fans pointed out that the completed waffles that she showed off on her Instagram looked completely different from the pattern on the waffle maker she was using.
Markle filmed herself using a simple Cuisinart Waring Pro WMK200 Belgian Waffle Maker, which has deep ridges so each waffle can be split into quarters.
However, the completed waffles, which Markle plated up for Archie and Lilibet with kiwi, blueberry and whipped cream to make it look like a face, had no ridges and were flat.
“Meghan Markle’s relentless compulsion to lie about everything is baffling - even over something as trivial as a waffle,” one royal watcher wrote.
“She posted a video of herself using a waffle maker with a divider, yet the so-called ‘homemade’ waffle she presented looked exactly like a store-bought one, missing the dividers that should have been there.”
However, one loyal supporter suggested Markle could have simply made different waffles for Harry and Archie and Lilibet using different irons.
The mysterious shamrock waffles come days after Markle and Netflix confirmed the Duchess of Sussex’s cooking show ‘With Love, Meghan’ has been renewed for a second season.
While both Netflix and Markle described the series as “renewed”, a production insider at Netflix told the Daily Mail that the “second” season of With Love, Meghan was filmed “back-to-back” with the first batch of episodes last year.
“I know they filmed the shows back-to-back,"" the insider said.
“So, in theory there is no second season. It’s like with lots of Netflix shows, it is already in the bag at the same time as the first one.
“What this does is allow edits to be made to the show from feedback from press and Netflix viewers, so no, the overall contract hasn’t been renewed yet.”",SKY News,lifestyle

The ex-political staffer married Mr Sharaz in a lavish wedding on the Gold Coast last year and the newlyweds have recently relocated to Melbourne with their newborn son.
Ms Higgins, 30, took to Instagram to share a Sydney Morning Herald article detailing Mr Sharaz’s new gig on Wednesday.
“Beyond proud of this wonderful human @davidsharaz and his new gig as Director at boutique PR agency Third Hemisphere,” Ms Higgins wrote.
“Cannot think of a better team of people for you to be working alongside — a values driven firm of formidable professionals.
“So happy for you and relieved the news is finally out.”
Mr Sharaz, 33, previously worked as a journalist and media advisor and it is understood his new job will entail boosting the agency's political media engagement.
The ex-journalist is understood to have not worked full-time since shortly after Ms Higgins received a $2.4 million payout from the Commonwealth in 2022.
Mr Sharaz proposed to Ms Higgins at Byron Bay on New Year’s Eve in 2022 months after the former political staffer was paid compensation after she was raped by Bruce Lehrmann in Parliament House.
Ms Higgins is still battling a lengthy defamation case brought on by her former employer Senator Linda Reynolds over subsequent social media posts about Reynolds’ handling of the rape claim.
Mr Sharaz was named in the case but conceded defeat due to limited financial resources.
The newlyweds were previously living in France in a home purchased by Ms Higgins in an effort to start afresh following intense media coverage in Australia.
However, the couple were forced to list their chateau in the south of France and returned to Australia, reportedly to fund legal fees in the ongoing Reynolds defamation case.
The 160 sqm three-bedroom, two-bathroom villa near Bergerac in Dordogne, France, was originally listed on a local real estate website for €420,000 (AU$682,820) before being reduced to €404,000 (AU$656,808).
As of Tuesday, the asking price has been slashed again and the home is currently advertised for the bargain price of just €350,000 (AU$600,000).",SKY News,lifestyle

The 44-year-old former co-host of The Project was visibly tearful as she placed her hand over her mouth in the photo posted on Instagram on Friday.
In the caption, Bickmore said she sent the selfie to a friend who offered her support some months ago on a particularly bad day.
""Scrolling through my camera roll this morning, I found this photo I’d sent a friend a few months ago when I was having a terrible day, and she had checked up on me,"" she wrote.
""I don’t often post on the days I feel crap (and there are a lot of them) because I usually go quiet.
""But I thought it was worth sharing. We all have sad days/weeks/months for so many varied reasons, and if you are having a sh** one, I hope tomorrow is a brighter day.""
""You are not alone.""
Australian singer Tones and I and The Bachelor star Anna Robards commented heart emojis on the post.
One more fan commended Bickmore for her ""powerful"" words.
""This is powerful Carrie. Well done. We all have those days, it’s good to show it’s not always rosy and shiny. This is life in all its shades,"" they said.
""Thank you for sharing; it’s a reminder to always choose kindness! We truly never know what challenges someone is facing or the extent of them,"" said another person.
""Amen to those friends that simply check in, they know they don’t have the answers, but a simple message is sometimes all you need to make your day a little brighter! I hope you are seeing brighter days now, too, Carrie.""
Another fan called to ""normalise"" unhappy emotions.
""Take a day at a time; if that’s too much, go by the hour! It’s okay not to be okay. Normalise it,"" they said.
Bickmore co-hosts the Hit Network's popular  national drive radio show, Carrie & Tommy with Tommy Little.
She has been candid about her mental health struggles, previously telling Little she has had anxiety and panic attacks since she was about 20 years old.
“People have an idea of what anxiety looks like, and I think it is very different for everybody, and you would often not know what is going on for somebody because people are very good at masking it,” she said, fighting back tears, last August.
“And I thought, hey, it might help if I shared some of the stuff that has happened to me for someone else to feel not so alone.
“It’s hard, actually, to describe what I felt. It was like shame, I think, (also) embarrassment. I don’t think I really fully understood what was going on in my own head. I think talking about it almost made me feel more anxious, so I just kept it in my own head.""
It comes after her husband Greg Lange died following a decade-long battle with brain cancer in 2010. They had a son, Oliver Lange, 17.
Bickmore also had two daughters, Evie, nine, and Adelaide, six, with her ex-partner Chris Walker.
She has said she started getting professional help for her mental health while pregnant with Evie and described its effect as life-changing.

"'Gee, this aged well': Glamorous WAG Bec Judd launches withering attack on 'Dictator' Dan Andrews after his successor Jacinta Allan overhauls Victorian bail laws",Chloe Walker,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/celebrity-life/gee-this-aged-well-glamorous-wag-bec-judd-launches-withering-attack-on-dictator-dan-andrews-after-his-successor-jacinta-allan-overhauls-victorian-bail-laws/news-story/d5e18ab16975789d61b874e6993465a5,"Rebecca 'Bec' Judd has reignited her feud with Dan Andrews after his successor, Victorian Premier Jacinta Allan, unveiled the ""toughest bail laws"" in the country.
On Wednesday,  Allan announced a major legal overhaul aimed at preventing reoffending and restoring community safety amid the state's spiralling crime crisis.
""Our tough bail laws will jolt the system- putting community safety above all, creating the toughest bail laws ever, and ensuring bail rules are respected,"" she said.
Bec, the wife of AFL legend Chris Judd, who lives in a $7.3 million Brighton mansion, first raised concerns about crime in May 2022.
She was also a vocal opponent of Melbourne's extended lockdowns, previously clashing with the former Victorian Premier Dan Andrews over safety in her neighbourhood.
Following Allan's bail reform announcement, Judd took to social media to reflect on her years-long campaign against crime- and her ongoing feud with Andrews.
The 42-year-old posted a screenshot of a May 2022 news article in which the then-Premier dismissed her concerns.
""Gee, this aged well,"" she wrote over the image, circling the date.
""Imagine the lives that could’ve been saved. Imagine the terror experienced by so many Victorians that could’ve been stopped if the Dictator had acted when I called this out.""
Critics of Andrews gave him the moniker 'Dictator Dan' during the COVID-19 pandemic, when Melbourne endured some of the world's longest lockdowns.
The mother-of-four also took aim at his successor, calling the government’s latest bail reforms ""too late for many"" but acknowledging it was ""a start"".
""And mark my words, if the Government stuffs this up again, I will continue to get everyone to know about it,"" she declared.
""I am a mum and a proud Victorian who just wants my beloved Melbourne to go back to being the best city in the world where everybody feels safe to live their lives in peace.""
The WAG and businesswoman tagged TV host Jacquie Felgate and radio personality Fifi Box in her post, writing ""power to the people"" alongside a peace sign emoji.
Crime has surged in Victoria over the past two years, with Crime Statistics Agency data showing theft rates have jumped to 2,995 incidents per 100,000 people.
Youth crime has also skyrocketed, reaching a 15-year high with 23,810 incidents recorded in the 12 months to February, an increase of 16.9 per cent.
The crime wave has left many Victorians feeling unsafe, and Judd has been one of the most outspoken critics of the government's handling of law and order.
The Victorian Government's new bail laws will apply to both adults and youths charged with serious crimes, including carjacking and home invasions.
Machetes are also set to be banned as part of the crackdown.

'This new ring does seem to be her favourite': Princess Catherine appears without iconic engagement ring during major appearance in Wales,Reilly Sullivan,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/celebrity-life/this-new-ring-does-seem-to-be-her-favourite-princess-catherine-appears-without-iconic-engagement-ring-during-major-appearance-in-wales/news-story/9ba892be104a945ab0c987da8318c430,"Princess Catherine appears to have ditched her iconic sapphire engagement ring in favour of more subtle royal jewellery for public appearances.
The Prince and Princess of Wales appeared in Cardiff ahead of the Six Nations rugby match on Saturday and spent time meeting injured players who were supported by the Welsh Rugby Charitable Trust.
However, eagled-eyed royal watchers were quick to notice that the Princess was not wearing her famous sapphire engagement ring.
""The Princess of Wales seems to be alternating between her engagement ring and this new one, which is most likely a gift from Prince William,” one royal fan wrote on X.
“I wonder what makes her choose one or the other for her engagements, though this new ring does seem to be her favourite.""
Instead of her iconic sapphire ring, the Princess of Wales has noticeably been wearing a newer ring featuring an eternity band of dark gems and diamonds.
The 43-year-old Princess wore the new band in a stack alongside her Welsh gold wedding ring and a similar diamond eternity band.
Kate first revealed the eternity band during a video address confirming she had completed her chemotherapy treatment, leading to speculation the ring was a gift from the Prince of Wales.
Catherine’s engagement ring is one of the most famous pieces in the royal jewellery box and was previously Princess Diana’s engagement ring.
Diana’s extensive jewellery was divided up between William and Harry following her death in 1997 who in turn have passed on pieces to their wives.
Princess Catherine was famously given Diana’s iconic sapphire engagement ring by William and later acquired Diana’s double drop sapphire earrings.
Meghan Markle has also received several of Diana’s heirlooms, including an emerald cut aquamarine ring and her yellow gold Cartier Tank watch which the Duchess of Sussex continues to wear to this day.",SKY News,lifestyle
'You don't belong here': How Nova's Jase and Lauren went from feeling like outsiders in Melbourne to ruling the city's airwaves,Chloe Walker,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/celebrity-life/you-dont-belong-here-how-novas-jase-and-lauren-went-from-feeling-like-outsiders-in-melbourne-to-ruling-the-citys-airwaves/news-story/666710a7ed0aee576c870e395f7f932a,"Nova's Jason 'Jase' Hawkins and Lauren Phillips have a lot to celebrate - and their powerhouse breakfast show is just the start.
Sitting in the studio with close friend slash co-host and newsreader Clint Stanaway, the trio has just wrapped another jam-packed morning featuring interviews with music sensation Teddy Swims and an astronomer.
The day before, they had Liberal leader Peter Dutton in the studio, and by the week's end, Spice Girl Mel C will have graced their star-studded show.
""There’s never one day the same,"" Phillips, 38, says.
""We love it, we love our team, and we love coming into work every day.""
Stanaway, who also moonlights as a Channel Nine sports and news presenter and Weekend Today host, agrees: ""You'd be surprised how much we actually pivot on air from day to day - we get to cover a lot.""
Hawkins, 42, best encapsulates the joy the trio feel about their jobs, which has seen them interview everyone from Bob Geldof to a dishwasher expert - one of Jase's favourite conversations to date.
""We’ll be in the car park at 5:30 in the morning, looking at each other like, we f****** love this. We love our jobs,"" he grins.
""But it hasn’t come easy.""
Jase and Lauren, who first teamed up in 2021 ""literally in the depths of COVID,"" previously worked at KIIS FM before being axed to make way for Sydney's Kyle Sandilands and Jackie 'O' Henderson.
""Lauren and I had to work together for six months without even being able to go for a coffee,"" Jase recalls.
""We had a fast track to our friendship - we opened the mics knowing not a lot about each other, and it was a quick way to get to know someone.""
Their chemistry quickly connected with their audience, who were enduring some of the world's longest lockdowns.
In a stroke of serendipity, both Jase and Lauren separately suggested Stanaway as a ""great option"" for their newsreader.
While Clint and Lauren had been close friends for over 20 years, the trio's instant camaraderie became their secret weapon.
""We were all getting to know each other, but our audience was listening to this flourishing friendship. They got to know when Jase pushed me too far or when I pushed him too far, they were all on that wild ride with us,"" Lauren says.
""And it was a time when everyone in this city was vulnerable and open to warts and all. There was no showiness, it was just pure honesty.""
It's perhaps the little ""showiness"" that has kept Jase & Lauren going from strength to strength since their Nova debut in early 2024.
Since returning to the airwaves after what Clint jokingly describes as a ""forced sabbatical"", the show has dominated Melbourne's radio ratings, most recently claiming an 11.5 per cent share, far surpassing their former KIIS FM bosses.
But do they see it as revenge? Not at all.
""To be honest, we’re not really focused on what anyone else is doing,"" Lauren insists.
""Melbourne is front of mind in everything we do. We like our show to be cheeky but never nasty. Those are the pillars of our show.""
Jase adds: ""Yeah, I don’t think we’ve ever sat in a meeting and talked about what’s happening on a rival show. It’s just not for us.""
For the father-of-three who has worked in radio for over 25 years, this moment feels different.
""I’ve done this (radio) for a long time, probably eight, nine years in Melbourne, and this is the first time I've actually felt like I belong here,"" he admits.
""I didn't come from a big football profile or a TV background. I always felt like people on other stations would look at me and think, 'You don't belong here.'""
While Jase says the trio has never really considered themselves underdogs, he ""quite likes being the hunted"" now.
Lauren, who left her ""dream job"" as a weather presenter on The Today Show to do radio, agrees.
""A year later, we still get callers saying, 'Guys, welcome back, it’s so great to have you back'.  It's a nice reminder that this job isn't just given to you. These seats were taken from us, and now we're back, and we're so grateful,"" she says.
Unlike some of their competitors, Jase, Lauren, and Clint have no plans to take their show national.
""We’re not leaving Melbourne,"" she declares.
""We’re just happy the swipe card works every morning,"" Jase jokes.
And as for the secret to their success?
It’s simple: authenticity, friendship, and a deep connection to their listeners.
""The encouragement we've received has really warmed our hearts and pushed us even more,"" Clint says.
Lauren sums it up: ""We hit the jackpot. Someone thought the three of us would be good together, and for that, I'm extraordinarily grateful.""",SKY News,lifestyle
'You have utterly disrespected us as Australians': Calls for American influencer to be 'deported' after distressing act with baby wombat,Chloe Walker,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/celebrity-life/you-have-utterly-disrespected-us-as-australians-calls-for-american-influencer-to-be-deported-after-distressing-act-with-baby-wombat/news-story/c3c607953e1cb206b9cd6b24ffe09e71,"An American influencer has outraged Australians after posting a video of herself removing a baby wombat from its mother in the wild.
Sam Jones, known online as @samstrays_somewhere on Instagram, shared the now-deleted footage with her 92,000 followers.
In the 34-second clip, the self-described ""hunter,"" ""wildlife biologist,"" and ""environmental scientist"" is seen picking up the baby wombat from the side of a country road at night.
""Just caught a baby wombat,"" a laughing male Australian companion can be heard saying as the car's headlights illuminate the scene.
""Look at the mother, chasing after her.""
As the mother wombat pursues her, visibly distressed, Ms Jones runs towards the car while her companion continues laughing.
""I caught a baby wombat,"" she says to the camera, holding the squirming animal as it screeches.
""Ok, mum is right there, and she is pissed. Let's let him go.""
""No, he's right,"" the male replies.
Wearing sandals and a summer dress, Ms Jones eventually removes the baby wombat from the car.
""Alright, time to go. Come here, mama!"" she says, placing the baby back on the ground.
""My dream of holding a baby wombat has been realised!"" the Montana-based influencer captioned the post.
""Baby and mum were safely united and slowly waddled back off together into the bush. Wombats are such an incredible and TOUGH species!""
It is unclear how long Ms Jones has been in Australia or where the footage was filmed.
Although she deleted the post following backlash, the footage was widely circulated online, prompting fierce criticism.
Licensed wombat rescuer Yolandi Vermaak, who runs Wombat Rescue, reshared the video on her Instagram account.
""An American tourist who calls herself a biologist and environmental scientist stole a baby wombat from its mother in the wild,"" Vermaak said.
""She ran to her partner at the car to get it on film, and both were laughing the whole time, even though the baby was screaming in absolute terror and distress and the mum was following.""
Vermaak warned that mother wombats often flee when threatened, leaving their young vulnerable.
""It is VERY unusual for her to have followed this woman. And when a baby wombat is separated from its mum, it will follow anything it sees to find safety—including you. They don't always find each other again.""
She also highlighted a more serious issue, noting that both the mother and baby showed signs of mange, a highly contagious and potentially fatal skin disease caused by mites.
""She needed to know and report this so they can get help ASAP! Otherwise, they will die a slow, horrible death,"" Vermaak said.
Vermaak also questioned Ms Jones' claim that the baby was safely reunited with its mother, as the video does not confirm this.
""What I do know is that this is our country. You are a visitor. You have utterly disrespected us as Australians and our beautiful wildlife by acting in this way,"" she said.
""People like you are not welcome here. I hope you get kicked out, and if you’ve already left, I truly hope you will never be granted a visa again.""
Australians took to social media platforms to express their outrage, with many calling for Ms Jones to be deported.
""Reported and deported, we can only hope,"" one user wrote.
""Cancel her visa,"" another demanded.
The identity of Ms Jones' male companion remains unknown.

'I got the Piers Morgan treatment': Why Meghan Markle dropped close friend Nick Ede after meeting Prince Harry,Reilly Sullivan,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/celebrity-life/i-got-the-piers-morgan-treatment-why-meghan-markle-dropped-close-friend-nick-ede-after-meeting-prince-harry/news-story/10b6eeb8daef3513a5654d7bd3c7e68f,"Meghan Markle’s former confidante has spoken out about the demise of their friendship and revealed why the real Markle “didn't really come across” on her Netflix show.
TV presenter and PR expert Nick Ede was once a close friend of the Duchess of Sussex when the then-Suits actress started spending more time in London to explore career opportunities in the UK.
In a new interview with Hello! magazine's A Right Royal Podcast, Mr Ede said he and Meghan would regularly grab lunch, go out shopping or meet for drinks at the elite Soho House.
However, the future Duchess of Sussex appeared to end their fast friendship after meeting Prince Harry in 2016.
""Things cooled off (after Harry and Meghan met),"" Mr Ede said on Thursday.
""I got the Piers Morgan treatment in the end.""
Despite admitting Meghan ghosted him after she began moving in royal circles, Mr Ode defended Markle as “genuine” while admitting her authenticity did not translate on her new Netflix show.
“I tell you what is great about Meghan - and didn't really come across in the TV show - is that she was genuinely interested in people and genuinely wanted to take the time... to learn more about them,” he said.
“I felt that was really authentic and I really liked that about her - there was also a vulnerability and insecurity too.
“She looked fabulous and gorgeous, but there was a shyness too, which was very endearing.""
Mr Ede is at least the third person who was quickly befriended and then “ghosted” by Markle when she started visiting London in the mid-2010s in search of career opportunities.
Notoriously, broadcaster Piers Morgan has claimed Markle similarly befriended and then ghosted him after meeting Harry, sparking an almighty public feud which ended with Morgan losing his hosting gig on Good Morning Britain in 2021 after he slammed Markle's interview with Oprah Winfrey on air.
British media personality Lizzie Cundy met the future Duchess of Sussex when Meghan first travelled to the United Kingdom but was also ""ghosted"" when she became engaged to Prince Harry in 2017.
“Once the ring was on the finger, I soon realised she was off Twitter and that her number wasn’t working and that was it,"" Cundy told Grazia in 2021.
“I’m afraid both Piers Morgan and I got ghosted.""
Markle has also fallen out with other high profile friends, with the list including Victoria Beckham and Canadian socialite Jessica Mulroney.",SKY News,lifestyle
'He can hide away behind closed gates': Inside Harry's new life with 'second father' Earl Spencer at Althorp,Reilly Sullivan,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/celebrity-life/he-can-hide-away-behind-closed-gates-inside-harrys-new-life-with-second-father-earl-spencer-at-althorp/news-story/558052e617442735dab1c6286c58e973,"Prince Harry will stay with his beloved uncle Earl Spencer when he returns to the United Kingdom next month for a major court appearance, a Sussex insider has claimed.
The Duke of Sussex is set to return to London in April for a court appearance amid his ongoing legal battle with the British Home Office over the loss of the Sussexes’ taxpayer-funded security.
Prince Harry and Meghan Markle were stripped of their protection officers after the Sussexes opted to “step back” from royal duties in 2020 and moved to California.
The home office initially won the case after arguing the Sussexes are no longer entitled to the expensive security but the Duke’s legal team is appealing the High Court’s decision.
According to royal author Phil Dampier, Harry is likely to stay with Earl Spencer at Althorp when he returns to the UK amid his estrangement from his father King Charles and brother Prince William.
“Althorp now seems to be Prince Harry’s go to place to stay when he is in the UK,” Mr Dampier told The Sun newspaper on Tuesday.
“Althorp is far enough from London to give Harry a sense of freedom away from the spotlight, and he can hide away behind closed gates.
“It’s quite likely Harry will stay there when he is next in the UK for his court cases.”
The sprawling Spencer seat in Northamptonshire outside London was previously Princess Diana’s childhood home and was inherited by Charles Spencer in 1992.
Set over 13,000 acres, Althorp contains 28 listed buildings and structures in addition to the main house and rivals some official royal residences in size and opulence.
Earl Spencer most recently shared the stately home with his estranged third wife Karen Spencer and their daughter but it is understood the Countess Spencer has now vacated Althorp.
According to Mr Dampier, Harry has increasingly relied on his uncle for support when he travels back to the UK after staying at Althorp last year during a discreet visit to attend a Spencer family funeral.
“Harry’s relationship with his uncle Earl Spencer, Diana’s brother, is also very important to him,” he said.
“He famously said he would look after Harry and William as part of their ‘blood family’ in his eulogy at Diana’s funeral.
“At the time some found that a controversial thing to say bearing in mind the Princes still had a father.
“But as time has gone on, and with Harry estranged from both his brother and father, his relationship with Charles Spencer has become more important to him.”
Harry and Meghan have officially been without a home in the United Kingdom since the King evicted the Sussexes’ from their former residence Frogmore Cottage days after Harry’s memoir Spare hit bookshelves in 2023.
Last year, royal insiders even speculated that Earl Spencer had offered Althorp as a temporary base for Harry and Meghan amid rumours the Sussexes wanted to establish a rival court.
On the contrary, Mr Dampier believes that Harry’s visits to Althorp have been welcomed by his estranged brother William.
""To be brutally honest I think William would prefer Harry to stay at Althorp rather than in a royal palace,” he said.",SKY News,lifestyle
"Prince William wants scandal-plagued uncle Prince Andrew to 'vanish from public view' after nude massage claims emerge, royal experts claim",Chloe Walker,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/celebrity-life/prince-william-wants-scandalplagued-uncle-prince-andrew-to-vanish-from-public-view-after-nude-massage-claims-emerge-royal-experts-claim/news-story/6b7a303c74301ca56e48087e2159a75c,"New allegations against Prince Andrew could be the breaking point for Prince William, with a royal expert claiming the heir to the throne wants his embattled uncle to ""vanish"" from the royal spotlight.
The disgraced Duke of York, 65, has been accused of acting ""inappropriately"" towards a female masseuse in 2000 after she was summoned to Buckingham Palace by convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell.
Royal expert Hilary Fordwich told Fox News Digital that Prince William, who has been actively supporting his father, King Charles III, is fed up with Andrew's ongoing scandals and wants him removed from royal circles.
""This is yet another national and royal embarrassment for all,"" Fordwich said.
""Prince William so wants his uncle Andrew to vanish from public view.""
Fordwich also claimed King Charles is ""beyond exasperated"" with his brother and has deliberately distanced himself to ensure Andrew does not appear alongside senior royals.
Royal expert Ian Pelham Turner suggested that Prince William, 42, is unlikely to show any leniency towards Andrew while King Charles, 76, continues his cancer treatment.
""More allegations of potential impropriety will cause King Charles and Prince William (to take) further action,"" Turner said.
""William has gained a reputation for being hot-headed, and even Charles could see this as the last straw with his brother.""
The masseuse at the centre of the allegations is believed to be 60-year-old Monique Giannelloni, who told MailOnline that Maxwell booked her to provide a massage for Prince Andrew in 2000.
Giannelloni, who is currently writing a memoir about her experience, said she remains unsettled after realising, years later, how close she came to Jeffrey Epstein's dangerous network.
""Andrew should never have been in contact with these people,"" she said.
Giannelloni, who operated a successful private practice in Kensington, recalled Maxwell telling her she would be introduced to a ""high-profile contact"", someone ""more famous than God.""
That contact turned out to be Prince Andrew, with the massage scheduled for June 30 inside his suite at Buckingham Palace.
According to Giannelloni, security at the Palace was lax, with her car registration number on a list being enough to gain access without thorough checks.
But she said she was shocked when Andrew entered the room where she had set up her work table, and immediately stripped naked in front of her.
""Andrew showed a complete disregard for my professionalism,"" she said.
""Of course, I have seen naked bodies while working before, but his behaviour was driven by his sense of entitlement.""
As a member of the Royal family, Giannelloni said that Andrew ""should be showing a greater sense of decorum and taste"".
""I am a respectable and qualified massage therapist,"" she said.
""I was not impressed by his behaviour. It was an abuse of his privilege.""
Prince Andrew, whose ties to both Epstein and Maxwell and allegations of sexual assault by Epstein victim Virginia Giuffre saw him stripped of his royal titles by the late Queen Elizabeth II in 2022, has continued to fall from grace in the years since.
In December, explosive revelations about Prince Andrew's close relationship with an alleged Chinese spy triggered a national security crisis.
Months later, Prince Andrew's ties to Ukrainian businessman Oleg Firer, who was once named a ""threat to national security"" and banned from a Commonwealth country, came to light.
He has also faced scrutiny over the deteriorating state of his home, Royal Lodge, which he refuses to vacate.

Married At First Sight bride Jacqui Burfoot reveals she is 'unable to work' as a lawyer since Nine aired her controversial edit,Isabella Rayner,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/celebrity-life/married-at-first-sight-bride-jacqui-burfoot-reveals-she-is-unable-to-work-as-a-lawyer-since-nine-aired-her-controversial-edit/news-story/4a8ec5bce38dba99c48234b078ed7e7c,"Married At First Sight bride Jacqui Burfoot has revealed she cannot continue her career as a lawyer since Nine aired her controversial edit on the show.
The 29-year-old New Zealander, who has a double degree in law and finance with first-class honours in law, was paired with project manager Ryan Donnelly on the Nine Network's controversial reality dating show.
But in an exclusive interview with SkyNews.com.au, Jacqui claimed she had not worked as a lawyer at a high-end firm in NSW since the show aired in January, alleging her edit affected her capacity to perform.
Jacqui has been accused by viewers of being a ""golddigger"" and ""loopy"", with fans lambasting her for ""fake crying"" about seemingly mundane details such as having a television in the couple's bedroom.
""I essentially left my job after I tried to go back to work because I was mentally distressed and couldn't work,"" she said on Wednesday.
""I've been unable to continue my career... I've been left to fend on my own, basically,"" added the reality TV star.
""I wasn't medically capable of performing my duties because I was under so much mental distress and trauma.
""I guess I had post-traumatic stress disorder from the show, and I couldn't function at work. I just couldn't. My capacity to perform wasn't there.""
Jacqui said she believed she could not return to work ""for at least two years"" and even then, it would require a drastic personal makeover.
She said she would need to change her name and dye her hair before returning to the professional setting to avoid being recognised.
""I just don't think it's possible... I'm like, not capable of working right now,"" she said.
""So it's just not an option currently or in the foreseeable future.""
Jacqui is believed to be currently in a relationship with groom Clint Rice and living at his home in Tasmania after reportedly relocating to the island state from Sydney after the show's filming wrapped last December.
Her personal website lists a Tasmanian PO Box for correspondence, contains a link to her jewellery business and invites ""collabs"".
It's understood Jacqui and Clint formed a romantic connection after their respective on-screen relationships with Ryan and Lauren Hall ended.
While Jacqui and Ryan's relationship is still airing at the time of writing, she claims to have taken legal action against him.
It comes after he posted several screenshots of alleged message exchanges between them, which were of a sexual nature, on Instagram on Wednesday.
He posted the screenshots hours after Jacqui shared the full version of a confession letter she wrote to him during filming.
Her letter detailed her concerns about Ryan, including allegations he ""put her down"" and was ""hyper-defensive when challenged"".
Jacqui took to Instagram Stories on Thursday to claim she had filed a police report against Ryan after he posted the messages, saying his move was an act of ""revenge"".
She also exclusively told SkyNews.com.au she is in the process of filing an Apprehended Personal Violence Order (APVO) against him.

Stephen Collins' 7th Heaven co-stars visibly shaken as details of the actor's child sexual abuse scandal laid bare,Isabella Rayner,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/celebrity-life/stephen-collins-7th-heaven-costars-visibly-shaken-as-details-of-the-actors-child-sexual-abuse-scandal-laid-bare/news-story/32ad11c3426a3db41a800e42b48905bf,"Stephen Collins' 7th Heaven co-stars were recently left visibly shaken as they heard details of his alleged sexual abuse of minors during a new documentary on the disgraced actor.
Collins starred as Eric Camden from 1996 through 2007 on the American TV series, which followed the lives of the Camdens and their seven children.
New York police probed the 77-year-old's dark past in 2014 after an audio tape leaked to the media revealed a male voice, alleged to be Collins', admitting to previous sexual abuse of a minor under 14 years old.
About two months later, Collins admitted to ""inappropriate sexual conduct with three female minors"" in 1973, 1982, and 1994 during an interview with People.
The bombshell revelations are set to be exposed in the first episode of Investigation Discovery's six-part documentary Hollywood Demons on March 24.
The episode, entitled Stephen Collins, America's Dad, includes interviews with 7th Heaven actors Jeremy London and Kyle Searles, Collins' abuse survivor April Price, and analyst Dr Drew Pinsky.
London, who played Chandler Hampton in the series, said Collins would be ""dead"" if his survivors were the actor's children as he listened to his admission for the first time.
""It’s tough, it's hard,"" he said.
""I'm a dad first and foremost, above everything else. So, my first thought goes to the children.
""Stephen Collins would be a dead man if that was my child.""
Searles, who played Mac in the longest-running series on The WB network, said he was shaking when he learned about one of Collins' survivors' young age.
""I had no idea the first one was ten (years old). All three are wrong, don't get me wrong...I'm kind of shaking right now,"" he said.
""This is the first time that I've ever thought that he's full of s***. No, I am not satisfied with this. I have a knot in my stomach.""
Searles then echoed London as he spoke of how fatherhood changed his perceptions and admitted he regretted putting Collins on a pedestal.
""My whole world changed when I had kids of my own. My whole worldview and certainly my tolerance for this,"" he said.
""It goes without being said, but you know what I mean. I just think that I put him up on a professional pedestal a bit too much.""
Collins allegedly exposed himself to then-13-year-old Price twice when she spent the summer of 1983 in Los Angeles with her aunt, who was Collins' neighbour.
In the episode, she recalled being ""supremely shocked"" when he exposed himself to her while helping set up her gaming console.
""He's in the living room in my aunt's apartment, hooking up that Atari and he turned around and his jeans were completely open, and he's completely exposed,"" she said
Price said she was “very uncomfortable and still didn’t want to insult him because he was kind to me and nice and doing me a favour.”
She also refuted Collins' claims in an interview with ABC in 2020, where he said he ""stopped everything cold"" after first exposing himself to her.
Price said that was ""not what happened"" and claimed he exposed himself to her again.
""The way that he portrayed it, that it only happened once, sent me into a fury,"" she said.
""He's trying to save his career, and he's downplaying it, but on the other hand, is the person that it happened to. I was enraged.""
She said she once found Collins completely naked shortly after he returned from changing his clothes when the two were in his apartment.
Prince said he led her into his apartment, which had memorabilia from the short-lived drama Tales of the Gold Monkey, of which April was a fan.
“And my stomach just fell, and now I’m actually scared,” she said.
“I’m in this man’s apartment. I’m in a bathing suit, and he’s naked. This is bad.
""This is really bad. I don’t know what I’m going to do.”
Collins' wife, Faye Grant, recorded the leaked tapes without Collins’ knowledge while he discussed his pattern of abusing young girls in a therapy session in 2012.

Australian winemaker Taylors dominates at Catad’Or World Wine Awards with its Cabernet Sauvignon 2021 scooping three gongs,Isabella Rayner,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/arts-and-culture/australian-winemaker-taylors-dominates-at-catador-world-wine-awards-with-its-cabernet-sauvignon-2021-scooping-three-gongs/news-story/2e5a4fffc26abac448f947fa7683ed2f,"SA winery Taylors has claimed three major trophies at Chile’s prestigious Catad’Or World Wine Awards as Australian winemakers continue to make their mark on the global stage.
On the weekend, Taylors St Andrews Cabernet Sauvignon 2021 was awarded the show’s major prize, Best In Show (Best Wine of the Competition), and trophies for Best Red Wine and Best Icon Wine.
Sixty wine specialists from 15 nations blind-tasted and deliberated over four days to determine the winners of what is promoted as Latin America’s most important international wine competition.
The 2024 panel included local and international sommeliers, Masters of Wine, winemakers, and educators, with judging following the International Organisation of Vineyard and Wine (OIV) standards.
Taylor’s third-generation winemaker and managing director Mitchell Taylor said he was “completely floored” that one of his company’s “finest cabernet” won three accolades.
“The St Andrews Cabernet Sauvignon showcases some of the finest vineyard sites on our family’s estate, so it’s an incredible honour to have the wine recognised at such a significant competition,” he said.
“The award caps off an equally challenging and exciting year for the Australian wine industry on the global stage.
“Australian winemakers and their wines continue to dominate international competitions, and it’s an honor for our wines to be recognised by such a prestigious group of professionals.”
Taylors St Andrews Cabernet Sauvignon 2021 is made with fruit sourced from blocks on the family-owned Clare Valley winery.
The winemaker said the drop is “complex and elegant, offering rich fruit characters of cassis and blackcurrant with earthy nuances”.
The win over the weekend follows the Australian wine industry receiving a big boost from China as the communist giant ended its crippling tariffs on the product in March, more than three years on from when they were imposed.
Mr Taylor said he was hopeful “renewed optimism in the economy will help bring excitement and growth back into the wine sector”.
“Going off of the success of our winemakers both here and overseas, now’s the time to enjoy a glass of Australian wine,” he said.
Established in 1969, Taylors was in 2022 ranked the thirteenth largest Australian wine company in total revenue.
Australian wine writer and critic James Halliday rated the vineyard five red stars in the 2012 Wine Companion.",SKY News,music
"Raygun releases video statement in response to ongoing saga over musical, wishes comedian Steph Broadbridge well",Patrick Staveley,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/arts-and-culture/raygun-releases-video-statement-in-response-to-ongoing-saga-over-musical-wishes-comedian-steph-broadbridge-well/news-story/f01ed3f0ea13ad21280c4905fff54ca7,"Australian breakdancer Rachael 'Raygun' Gunn has apologised following the resolution of a legal dispute after her lawyers shut down the opening of a musical parody on the Olympian.
Comedian Stephanie Broadbridge revealed just under two weeks ago her trial show for Raygun: The Musical was cancelled just hours before it was set to premiere in Sydney, after the breaker's lawyers contacted the venue and threatened legal action.
Broadbridge told her Instagram followers Raygun's lawyers trademarked the poster for the musical and advised the comedian she was not allowed to do the kangaroo dance because the Olympian who went viral for her performance in Paris ""owns"" it.
Raygun, 37, also trademarked the use of her name, leading to the rebranding of the musical on Thursday, with new dates announced for the show's opening.
Raygun took to Instagram hours after the show was promoted with a new title Breaking: The Musical and a fresh poster, as she wished the comedian well with the musical, while also reflecting on the ongoing saga.
""It's been a big couple of weeks. I'm not gonna lie, it's been a wild ride. But I'm really pleased to say that we've resolved everything,"" she said.
""My team's been working with Steph's team and we've managed to come to an agreement, and she still gets to go ahead with the musical, she gets a new name, new poster, and she still gets to take that show on the road, so I'm really happy for her and I wish her all the best with the show and with the tour.""
The tagline of the show, ""A completely legal parody musical"" is also a cheeky dig directed at Raygun.
Dates are scheduled from February 28 to March 2 in Adelaide at the Fringe Festival, as well as a run of four shows from May 7 to May 10 in Sydney.
Raygun moved to clarify she had ""not sought any costs from this"" amid reports her lawyers, 17 Degrees, demanded the musical's promoter and Darlinghurst's iD Comedy Club owner Anthony Skinner pay at least $10,000 in legal fees.
She said the $10,000 figure was from ""early on"" and was set to cover her potential legal costs if the issue ended up going to court.
The 37-year-old also said she appreciated Broadbridge's statement which addressed ""misinformation"" and again reiterated her team was not seeking any costs.
""It's not about the money, it's still not about the money. We've got no costs from them, not from Steph, not from the comedy club. It's all resolved, there's not going to be any more legal proceedings from us, it's an intellectual property issue and now we have put it to bed,"" she said.
The breaker said it had been a ""stressful"" and ""tough"" time for her, however she delivered an apology for those who were affected including Broadbridge and those involved in her show.
""It's never been my intention to cause any hurt or distress. This is a totally new environment for me to be in and I just want to say I am sorry for any hurt that was caused, cause I'm certainly not doing that intentionally,"" she said.",SKY News,music
Iconic Chinese restaurant Golden Century to welcome back diners at Crown Sydney after shutting doors during COVID-19,Sumaiya Chowdhure,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/arts-and-culture/iconic-chinese-restaurant-golden-century-to-welcome-back-diners-at-crown-sydney-after-shutting-doors-during-covid19/news-story/35c2fbb98e79d914454e5a3549767792,"Iconic Sydney institution Golden Century has revealed its comeback, unveiling plans to reopen at Sydney's Crown Barangaroo.
The award-winning, late-night Cantonese diner, which first opened in 1989 on Sussex Street, shut its doors in 2021 after it was plunged into administration, with creditors later voting to clear the debt.
Crown Resorts announced the return of the famous restaurant at a VIP summer event on Thursday, with customers to expect a taste of previous fan favourites including XO pippies, live lobster, abalone steamboat, Peking duck and salt and pepper squid.
Billy Wong, co-owner of Golden Century, recalled the restaurant's abrupt closure during COVID-19 and how he was surprised by the reaction of Sydneysiders.
“When we closed it was the end of our lease but in the middle of covid so it was abrupt but we were overwhelmed by the amount of love. We didn’t realise how much it meant to Sydney and our customers,” he said.
“Everyone has their own story about Golden Century, some might be a bit blurry, but it was such a diverse group of diners who would come there and for different reasons.
""That’s what resonated so having that history and brand and legacy, we felt we really wanted to bring it back to Sydney.
“Golden Century is where it all began and we are excited to once again welcome in our loyal customers, serving our beloved Cantonese classics in a picture-perfect location that overlooks Sydney harbour and beyond.”
Bondi’s popular Icebergs Bar and Grill will also be opening a pop up at Barangaroo over summer.
The Icebergs Harbour Bar will be offering diners its signature coastal Euro-leaning food and drinks, including the smashable Iceberger, and the No. 147, made with Ketel One vodka, coconut, passionfruit, pineapple, lemon and aromatic bitters.
Maurice Terzini, co-owner of Icebergs Dining Room and Bar said: “I have always had a love affair with great hotel bars; they’re transient and fun and you never know who you’re going to meet! This evolution of the Iceberg’s Bar will bring classic drinks and our signature bar food offering to Crown Sydney, matching the already decadent and luxurious guest experience”.
In a statement, Crown Sydney Chief Executive Officer, Stanford Le, said: ""Crown Sydney is already a beacon of hospitality in this beloved city, so it feels natural to add to our repertoire two renowned offerings from Sydney itself"".
""We are thrilled to become the new home of the iconic Golden Century, offering our guests an experience that is at once nostalgic and exciting, and to partner with Icebergs for a summer residency of their bar experience, bringing their Bondi expertise to the harbourside.""
Golden Century will start taking reservations in December.",SKY News,music

'Powerful' Leeuwin Estate Margaret River Art Series Chardonnay 2021 crowned most popular drop in Wine Ark collectors' hit parade,Des Houghton,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/arts-and-culture/powerful-leeuwin-estate-margaret-river-art-series-chardonnay-2021-crowned-most-popular-drop-in-wine-ark-collectors-hit-parade/news-story/22751f8104ce8dd7ae20a7516badaa8e,"A high-scoring chardonnay from Western Australia was the top of the wine collectors’ hit parade this year.
The Leeuwin Estate Margaret River Art Series Chardonnay 2021 ($159) was the bottle most frequently added to collections stored by Wine Ark, Australia's largest climate-controlled wine storage provider.
Wine Ark’s chief executive John Cuff said his firm holds more than a million bottles in its cellars in Australian capital cities.
Wine Ark provides an annual snapshot of bottles added to those collections.
“Leeuwin is one of the most sought-after chardonnays in the country,” Mr Cuff said.
“Chardonnay is wine my clients drink.  Red wine collectors tend to sit on them.”
Mr Cuff said the Art Series chardonnay collectors usually replenish their stocks with a case of two the newest.
Collectors tended to hold on to their reds longer. The producer with the most bottles collected this year was Penfolds, he said. They include crowd pleasers like St Henri and Bin 389.
The Art Series chardonnay is frequently described as one of Australia’s icon wines.
The latest example is powerful, rich and layered with flavours of stone fruit, pink grapefruit and lemon.
“A core and concentrated fruit spectrum of pear, lemon flesh and white nectarine provide the foundation,” winemaker Tim Lovett’s tasting note says.
“There is a graphite, flint, and chalk thread, combining with nutmeg and almond meal. Energetic and well poised, an array of fresh lime and nashi pear is laced throughout. The palate is ethereal, mineral and defined with a presence of natural acidity.”
He speaks of wet stone and “phyllitic characteristic”. Phyllite is a metamorphic rock.
Leeuwin Estate Margaret River Art Series Chardonnay is also celebrated for its artwork labels.
The collection now comprises over 150 paintings and artworks from artists including John Olsen, Arthur Boyd, Sir Sidney Nolan, Lloyd Rees, Albert Tucker, Fred Williams and Clifton Pugh.
The colourful label on the latest edition features an uplifting abstract painting titled “When Skies are Blue” by Jo Davenport from Splitters Creek, Albury in NSW.
When she heard her painting had been chosen Ms Davenport said she went to buy a bottle but decided against it when she saw the price.
“Then a case turned up in the mail,” she said. “We were so surprised. It was very kind of them.”

"Millions of travellers are flocking to Europe for religious pilgrimages to Notre Dame restoration, St Peter's Basilica jubilee",Des Houghton,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/arts-and-culture/millions-of-travellers-are-flocking-to-europe-for-religious-pilgrimages-to-notre-dame-restoration-st-peters-basilica-jubilee/news-story/ea1de5b8bfdea3eaf1df228f537804c5,"Europe is bracing itself for the arrival of 100 million travellers on religious pilgrimages.
Record numbers of tourists have booked to see the remarkable restoration of Notre Dame cathedral in Paris that reopens on Saturday.
Still more travellers will join in the Vatican’s Jubilee of Hope celebrations that start on Christmas Day and run for a year.
Notre-Dame was Europe’s most visited historical monument before it was badly damaged by an ungodly conflagration in 2019 for which the cause is still unknown.
The 860-year-old Gothic relic is expected to attract well over 50 million tourists this year and next.
The cathedral has come back to life magnificently after a five-year, $1.1bn (€700 million) repair.
Saturday’s official reopening ceremony will be attended by President-elect Donald Trump and other world leaders.
More than 1,000 oak trees were cut from 200 French forests to replace the frame of the cathedral's roof and spire.
And 450,000 square feet of limestone inside the cathedral was meticulously cleaned to strip away centuries of accumulated grime, ash and lead dust.
French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife Brigitte visited the church and told a group of around 1,300 assembled stonemasons, carpenters: “The shock of the reopening will be as great as that of the fire, but it will be a shock of hope.”
Renovation of flying buttresses and other parts of the cathedral’s exterior will continue for several more years, so some scaffolding will remain.
The tourist office said the reopening on Saturday will be followed by seven days “dedicated to celebrating the reopening and honouring those who saved and rebuilt the cathedral”.
A highpoint will be the return of the Crown of Thorns, the cathedral’s most sacred relic, which was saved from the fire and temporarily moved to the Louvre.
Notre-Dame’s daily schedule will resume from December 16. Reservations can be made online.
French culture minister Rachida Dati suggested a small entrance fee may one day be charged to enter Notre Dame.He pointed out that Canterbury Cathedral in England and Sagrada Família in Barcelona already charge a fee, as does the Pantheon in Rome.
Italy says an estimated 35 million pilgrims will visit the Eternal City for the 2025 Jubilee Year of Hope.
Much of the action will be at Vatican Museums and Sistine Chapel and at St Peter's Basilica a 10-minute stroll away.
St Peter’s Basilica was consecrated in 1626 and is the largest church in Christendom. Roman Catholic or not, travellers see Europe’s ancient churches and cathedrals as far more than places of worship.
They are rich pieces of history that have withstood revolutions and wars, fires and pandemics. And they are, of course, treasure troves of dazzling art - be they sculptures, paintings, stained glass or mosaics.
Some highlights: St Peter’s Basilica designed by Michelangelo is one of the most beautiful churches in the world.
It is home to ‘The Pieta’, an awesome work of art chiselled from Carrara marble by Michelangelo. It shows Jesus after his crucifixion in the lap of his mother Mary.
A Catholic jubilee usually occurs every 25 years.
On Holy Saturday on April 19, 2025, the Pope will celebrate a late evening Mass in St Peter's.
You must book well in advance for tickets to the traditional Easter Sunday Mass the next day celebrated at 10am by the Pope in front of St Peter's Square.
Up to 300,000 have jammed the square for the Pope’s blessing.When in Rome: Visit The Pantheon, built in the 2nd century a temple dedicated to all gods in ancient Rome.
It was commissioned by Marcus Agrippa during the reign of Augustus and for over a millennium had the largest dome in the world.
Today it is the Church of Santa Maria Rotonda.
London’s glorious St Paul’s Cathedral is also a tourist magnet. It was inspired by St Peter’s Basilica.
The crypt in London’s biggest church is the final resting place of characters as diverse as Lord Horatio Nelson, the sculptor Henry Moore, the poet John Dunne, the scientist Alexander Fleming and Sir Christopher Wren, architect of the church who oversaw its construction from 1675 to 1710.
The cathedral survived the Blitz by the Luftwaffe and came to symbolize Londoners' spirit of resilience.",SKY News,music
"Department of Foreign Affairs issues series of travel warnings for Year 12 leavers amid threat of terrorism, volcanic eruptions overseas",Des Houghton,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/arts-and-culture/department-of-foreign-affairs-issues-series-of-travel-warnings-for-year-12-leavers-amid-threat-of-terrorism-volcanic-eruptions-overseas/news-story/56ae031932c941f7113805c6041db7df,"The Department of Foreign Affairs has issued travel warnings for Grade 12 students set to attend schoolies celebrations in southeast Asia.
Thousands of young Australians are booked to travel to Indonesia, Thailand, Fiji, Vanuatu and Cambodia, letting off steam with boozy parties.
Travel plans for Bali are literally under a cloud with the eruption of the Mount Lewotobi Laki-Laki volcano spewing ash 10km into the sky and disrupting airline traffic.
Indonesia warns the volcanic activity that has already claimed 10 lives shows no signs of easing.
And while schoolies might curse the volcano for possibly disrupting their travel plans, they should spare a thought for the 6,000 people living close to the crater who have been evacuated.
Hadi Wijaya, chief of Indonesia's volcanology agency, said some eruptions sent towering ash columns eight to 10 km into the sky.
The region is part of what vulcanists call ‘the Pacific Ring of Fire’ that stretches across 15 more countries including New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Japan and on to the US, Chile, Canada, Guatemala, Russia and Peru.
“Many of Indonesia's volcanoes are active and can erupt without warning,” the Department of Foreign Affairs’ Smartraveller website warns.
“Adhere to exclusion zones around volcanoes, which can change at short notice, and follow the advice of local authorities. Volcanic activity may escalate without notice.”
For many vulnerable young people, schoolies' celebrations overseas will be their first trip abroad without parents or adult guardians.
As well as drinking parties youngsters may be exposed to drug taking.
And there are risks of sexual harassment and sexual assault, Smartraveller warns.
“When you leave Australia, you leave behind the support systems, emergency services and medical facilities,’’ it said.
“If you plan well and make smart choices, your schoolies trip can be the experience of a lifetime.”
Some good news is the Australian Christian Youth charity, Red Frogs, will attend Schoolies celebrations in Bali, Fiji and Vanuatu.
“Red Frogs recognises that alcohol is a big part of end of year celebrations,” a spokesman said.
“During schoolies or leavers week, excessive consumption of alcohol and other substances means that things can often get out of hand.
“Red Frogs volunteers act as the eyes and ears in accommodation venues and out on the streets, providing a positive peer presence to school leavers. They are non-judgemental.”
Red Frogs will be in Fiji from November 17 to December 6 and in Bali from November 23 to 30 by which time the ash cloud may have dissipated.
Foreign Affairs also has a blunt warning about travel insurance.
“If you're going overseas, travel insurance is as important as a passport. If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel,” the Smartraveller advice says.
“Travel doesn't always go to plan. The right insurance is as essential as a passport for travel overseas. You'll depend on your travel insurer for help if things go wrong. They can give both financial and practical support. Without it, you or your family could suffer financially.”
Travellers should also be aware of another significant threat.
“There's an ongoing risk of terrorist attack in Indonesia,” Smartraveller warns.
“Popular tourist areas may be the target of terrorist attacks.”",SKY News,music
Sofia Vergara heckles Jodie Foster from her seat after her Golden Globes 2025 loss,Unknown,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/arts-and-culture/sofia-vergara-heckles-jodie-foster-from-her-seat-after-her-golden-globes-2025-loss/news-story/87ba11285fdc37e5b3aba4a30ab4cad6,"Sofía Vergara is sick of losing.
The “Griselda” star, 52, had a big reaction to Jodie Foster winning the award for Best Actress in a Miniseries or Motion Picture—Television at the 2025 Golden Globes over her.
After Foster, 62, got onstage to accept her trophy, Vergara leapt up from her seat and shouted, “No! No! Not again!”
“I know,” Foster said to the fellow actress from onstage.
Vergara then shouted, “Give me one!”
Foster wasn’t offended by Vergara’s reaction — and even gave her a shout-out in her acceptance speech.
“The greatest thing about being this age and being in this time is having a community of all these people, especially you, Sofia,” the “True Detective” star said, pointing at Vergara in the audience.
Foster beat out Vergara (“Griselda”), Cate Blanchett (“Disclaimer”), Cristin Milioti (“The Penguin”), Naomi Watts (“Feud: Capote vs. the Swans”) and Kate Winslet (“The Regime”) in her category.
Vergara similarly lost to Foster back in September at the 2024 Emmy Awards.
At that ceremony, Foster won Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie over Vergara, Watts, Brie Larson (“Lessons in Chemistry”) and Juno Temple (“Fargo”).
“They stole it from me,” Vergara jokingly said in Spanish in an Instagram video after her Emmys loss last year.
“They stole it from me for the fifth time,” she added.
Vergara has been nominated for five Emmy Awards, four for “Modern Family” and one for “Griselda,” but she’s never won.
In “Griselda,” Vergara plays the titular Colombian drug lord Griselda Blanco. The Netflix miniseries premiered in January 2024.
“When I thought of Griselda, I wanted her to be like Tony Soprano. I wanted her to be a character that people didn’t hate, even though it was a bad guy,” Vergara said about the role in an interview with CBS News last year.
Foster, meanwhile, has been sweeping the latest award season for her role in Season 4 of “True Detective.” She won her fifth Golden Globe on Sunday night.
During her acceptance speech at the award show, Foster gave a shout-out to her “wonderful and beautiful” showrunner, Issa Lopez, as well as her co-star Kali Reis.
She also made rare comments about her wife Alexandra Hedison and her kids.
“I just want to thank my family,” Foster said.
“Because Kit, my scientist son, and Charlie, my actor son who’s starting his career, hopefully you understand the joy, such joy, that comes from doing really hard, meaningful, good work. So my boys, I love you, and this, of course, is for you. And the love of my life, Alex, thank you forever.”

AFL legend and MND battler Neale Daniher named Australian of the Year for 2025 for his work to fight the crippling disease,Laurence Karacsony,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/arts-and-culture/afl-legend-and-mnd-battler-neale-daniher-named-australian-of-the-year-for-2025-for-his-work-to-fight-the-crippling-disease/news-story/c66c5f4bacbfdff7dd1bd0b3e40abc80,"AFL legend and motor neurone disease battler Neale Daniher has been named as Australian of the Year for 2025 at the National Arboretum in Canberra for his work in finding a cure for the devastating disease.
Mr Daniher, 63, has grappled with MND, a neurodegenerative condition which erodes the sufferer’s ability to move, eat, speak and eventually breathe.
Flanked by his wife Jan Daniher, MR Daniher was announced as the 2025 AOTY winner by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese who said he was “delighted” to announce the honour had been awarded to the AFL great.
In 2013, Mr Daniher was diagnosed with the disease and has lost the ability to speak and requires a wheel chair for mobility, but despite his limited movement and his loss of voice, he attended the awards ceremony and delivered a speech.
Mr Daniher has helped raise more than $100 million to fund research for a cure for MND
In a pre-recorded computerised version of his speech, Mr Daniher accepted the award and said it was deeply honoured to be recognised.
“This recognition isn’t just for me, it belongs to the entire MND community,” he said.
“The families, the carers, the researchers, the volunteers, all of those at the Fight MND Foundation and MND state associations, and the countless Australians who have joined us in this fight.
“I chose to fight because if I didn’t, how could I expect anyone else to? I chose to hope because I believe in the decency and generosity of Australians.”
Mr Daniher said MND was not incurable, but “simply underfunded and misunderstood.
“With focus funding and unwavering determination, we can change that,” he said.
“We all have the power to choose to fight, to choose our attitude, to choose to smile and to choose to do something, because the mark of a person isn’t what they say, it’s what they do.”
The 2025 Senior Australian of the Year went to Brother Thomas Oliver ‘Olly’ Pickett who founded Wheelchairs For Kids in 1996 which has helped deliver 60,000 custom built wheelchairs for disabled children in more than 80 countries.
Mr Pickett has recruited 250 retiree workshop volunteers and dedicated the award to them.
The Wheelchairs For Kids founder said at a cost of $275, a disabled child could receive a “new life” and a newfound dignity, as well as mobility.
“They can now go to village school and have an education. They mix with their friends and feel included,” Mr Pickett said.
“Any donations, no matter how big or how small, will enable us to make more wheelchairs.”
The 2025 Young Australian of the Year went to Dr Katrina Wruck, 30, for her work in turning harmful “forever chemicals” in water to harmless ones.
Dr Wruck has used her research to support remote communities through her profit-for-purpose firm Nguki Kula Green Labs, which is pioneering a world-first laundry system to combat rheumatic heart disease.
The young scientist used her speech to talk about how “representation matters” and how her Indigenous heritage meant she “wasn’t supposed to succeed, touching on Australia Day and the “violent dispossession” the day represented.
“Today, we still exist under the structures of the British Empire,” she said.
“Tomorrow, January 26, is known by many names: Australia Day, Invasion Day, Survival Day.
“To some it is a day of celebration, a public holiday. To others, it is a stark reminder of the violent dispossession, a legacy that continues to this day.”
Named as joint Local Heroes for 2025, co-founders of Café Stepping Stone, a sustainable vegetarian cafe which offers on-the-job training and qualifications for culturally diverse women, were Canberrans Vanessa Brettell, 31, and Hannah Costello, 32.
The two Local Heroes run a range events through Stepping Stone, which has two locations, with a focus on community connection and social justice, including silent book clubs, craft sessions and a monthly menopause café.
Ms Brettell said the enterprise was about “providing opportunities, stability and hope”.
“In recognising our privilege, we felt compelled to use our skills and experience to help those who have not had the same opportunities,"" Ms Brettell said.
“Everybody deserves a fair chance to thrive, feel safe, and have access to meaningful work and be part of a community.""",SKY News,music
'Consider lesser-known destinations': Japan pleads for influx of Australians to look outside hotspots when holidaying in 2025,Preston Potts,https://www.skynews.com.au/world-news/global-affairs/consider-lesserknown-destinations-japan-pleads-for-influx-of-australians-to-look-outside-hotspots-when-holidaying-in-2025/news-story/3c868aae87bf7ec0111f1a05edaf8b9c,"Japanese officials are pleading with Australians to seek out more than just ""postcard sights"", as the nation tries to manage a major influx of eager holidaymakers.
More and more Aussies are flocking to the country each year, with a record 637,300 people visiting between January and September in 2024.
According to the Japan National Tourism Organisation (JNTO), that is a 42 per cent increase from the previous record set in 2019.
In addition to the number of tourists heading to Japan, Australian visitors also rank toward the top for average length of stay in the country.
However, the influx of Aussies travelling to popular places such as Tokyo, Kyoto, Mt Fuji, and the Golden Route has prompted JNTO's Australian office's executive director Naoki Kitazawa to  ""venture out"" and see more of what the country has to offer.
""We strongly encourage Australians to consider lesser-known destinations, as well as look at shoulder travel seasons, such as autumn, as well as Japan's summer – known locally as the 'green season' where the country's rural and regional areas really come into their own,"" he told news.com.au.
Mr Kitazawa said was glad to see Aussies returning to Japan post-COVID, but insisted tourists should broaden their horizons while being mindful to preserve the places they visited.
""Don't just stick to the postcard sights – venture out and uncover the stories that aren't always on the tourist trail,"" he said.
""By making informed decisions, travellers can contribute to preserving the beauty and integrity of the places you visit, ensuring they remain vibrant for future generations to enjoy.""
One spot Mr Kitazawa recommended was Kanazawa, which he described as a ""vibrant place"" with a rich teahouse and Geisha culture.
The city, which is known as ""little Kyoto"" is about 2 hours and 30 minutes by train from Osaka and Tokyo.
According to Japan and More, Tokyo remains on top as the most popular destination, but other spots are gaining popularity.

"How mathematician William Dong became Australia's newest vineyard tycoon, acquiring top-rated House of Arras, Bay of Fires",Des Houghton,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/arts-and-culture/how-mathematician-william-dong-became-australias-newest-vineyard-tycoon-acquiring-toprated-house-of-arras-bay-of-fires/news-story/a6c702c16b5cb823c391ad902412f1f8,"Introducing William Dong, a Chinese-born, UK-educated mathematician who happens to be Australia’s newest wine tycoon.
Dong, a Sydneysider with four children, owns vineyards in Victoria’s Yarra Valley and the Mornington Peninsula, Tasmania, the Barossa Valley and the Margaret River.
Five of his seven vineyards have won organic certification.
Dong has collected some seriously good wine properties including Bay of Fires, Handpicked Wines and House of Arras.
And he has launched a new venture FAB, (Flesh and Blood), a global online organic wine marketplace.
FAB supports artisan family winemakers, mostly Europeans, who specialise in organic wines.
“Wine is in their blood,” he said.
And so it is in Dong’s.
It has been quite a journey for the maths scholar who was born in the small village of Haimen in Guangdong on the South China Sea coast.
There his father was a humble fisherman.
At the age of 13, Dong was sent to an international school in Singapore where he excelled.
From there he went to university in the UK.
He arrived in Australia in 2002 aged 24 armed with degrees in financial mathematics from the University of Warwick and the University of Leeds.
He was about to join an investment bank when he changed his mind.
He had fallen under the spell of Australian wine and believed a career in wine offered endless possibilities.
It was in the UK that fellow students introduced him to Australian wines.
“I thought, wow, these are really good,” he said.
He discovered a “whole world of wine” he didn’t know existed.
When he came to Australia his appreciation of local appellations grew.
Soon wine became his passion, he said.
“After a few months I thought, maybe I don’t want to work in a bank. I was drawn to a career in wine.’’
He did his homework speaking to everyone he could in the wine trade from winemakers to consultants, retailers and marketeers.
“It was quite a journey, and it was hard. At first there was no money (income).”
He hired winemakers to source grapes from the regions he liked.
“We made wine with other people’s grapes - but that was not enough,” he said.
Dong wanted to make wine of a higher quality and realised the only way to guarantee consistency was to acquire his own vineyards.
He purchased Capella vineyard on the Mornington Peninsula in 2012.
A breakthrough came when wine maestro James Halliday described the vineyard as a rising star and gave his pinot noir 97 points.
Dong said it took 10 years to convince Halliday to taste his wines and to visit the winery.
“People like James Halliday never wanted to see us. They would say, who are you?”
With the tick of approval from Halliday the other critics were soon lining up to sniff, slurp and pontificate.
“At the beginning a lot of people were skeptical and put a question mark on us,” he said.
“But in the last five to 10 years, we have been making it happen. We have been winning trophies. If you have a vision and are willing to put in the hard work and energy, you can do it.
“I still live in Sydney. I don’t have the luxury of living on a vineyard just yet. We are still very basic with a lot more work to do.”
Right now, he is intrigued by chardonnay (who isn’t) and exploring the subtle difference in styles of the noble grape from his properties in the Yarra Valley, Mornington Peninsula and Tasmania.
And he is pleased the Margaret River vineyard is delivering high-end cabernet sauvignon.
“I’m very proud of what we are doing,” he said.
“But we are still small. We are not making enough noise.”",SKY News,music
Raygun accused of cultural appropriation after claiming ownership of kangaroo dance in legal threat against Sydney comedian,Laurence Karacsony,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/arts-and-culture/raygun-accused-of-cultural-appropriation-after-claiming-ownership-of-kangaroo-dance-in-legal-threat-against-sydney-comedian/news-story/c180c0f9cbee94dc4e1d66c072aac4bf,"Rachael 'Raygun' Gunn has been accused of cultural appropriation for claiming ownership of the ""kangaroo dance"" after the Olympian's legal team shutdown a musical about the breaker.
Stephanie Broadbridge announced on Saturday her trial show for Raygun: The Musical had been cancelled just hours before it was due to begin after the 37-year-old's lawyers contacted the venue to threaten legal action.
In a video shared to Instagram, Broadbridge said Raygun's lawyers trademarked her poster and advised the comedian she was not allowed to do the kangaroo dance because the viral Olympian ""owns"" it.
“That one did puzzle me, I mean, that’s an Olympic level dance. How would I possibly be able to do that without any formal breakdancing training?” Broadbridge said, with a degree of humour.
Broadbridge received an influx of support in response to her video, with many taking aim at Raygun's apparent attempt to claim ownership of the kangaroo dance.
“Is (Raygun) going to sue every Indigenous person in Australia that does that dance?” one social media user asked.
""Wouldn't it be funny if our Aboriginal brothers and sisters were to commence legal proceedings for stealing the roo dance and bringing culture into disrepute,"" another said.
A third accused the Olympian of cultural appropriation over the use of the dance move.
“She is claiming intellectual property on a 'kangaroo dance' which is very similar to that of many indigenous people’s, which goes back thousands and thousands of years,” they said.
“It’s layers and layers of cultural appropriation.”
While another social media user, a self-described Wiradjuri woman who was ""sick of cultural theft"", pounced on the moment to mock Raygun for thinking she owned the ""roo hop"" while believing she had a brand ""that can be damaged"".
""She's the gift that keeps on giving!"" she wrote.
According to the Australian Curriculum website on the storytelling practices of Indigenous people, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders use dances which depict ""movements and costumes to represent land animals"".
""The kangaroo is depicted in the dance of many cultural groups across Australia,"" the online resource says.
Other social media users criticised Raygun for trying to ""profit"" from her ridiculed Olympics performance.
""Raygun mocked the Olympics and her competitors with her performance and is now trying to profit from it,"" one wrote.
""Raygun and her team thought the musical would be damaging to her brand. They ever heard of the Streisand effect?"" another said.
Raygun’s manager Stephanie Scicchitano said the legal letter was designed to protect Raygun’s image.""While we have immense respect for the credible work and effort that has gone into the development of the show, we must take necessary steps to safeguard Rachael's creative rights and the integrity of her work,"" the statement said.
""This action is not intended to diminish the contributions of others, but rather to ensure her brand is properly represented and protected in all future endeavours.""
The management team also revealed they had lodged an application to register ""Raygun"" as a trademark, which they believe will accepted.
“In addition to the application, Rachael holds significant common law rights and goodwill in her stage name 'Raygun', further strengthening her position,” Raygun’s management and legal said.
“It has come to our attention that the use of the ‘Raygun’ name by a comedian without approval has caused confusion among the public, potentially leading them to believe that ‘Raygun The Musical’ had Rachael’s endorsement or approval.
“This misuse of intellectual property is not only misleading but also jeopardises Rachael’s other commercial ventures, which rely on the integrity of her brand.”
Under the Copyright Act 1968 (s. 41A), the use of a literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work does not constitute an infringement of copyright if the use is fair and is for the purpose of parody or satire.
Speaking to 9News over the weekend, Broadbridge said the musical would have been “good for her brand”, adding her initial feeling was “shock” when asked on her reaction to receiving the legal letter.
""I didn't expect to be on anyone's radar at this stage in the process of being this very small musical project,” she said.
In the caption for her Instagram video, Broadbridge said she would be back with a “whole new story arc” to add to the musical.
SkyNews.com.au has contacted Broadbridge for further comment.",SKY News,music
Celebrated Kiwi winery Villa Maria 'does the impossible' by making a $55 sauvignon blanc with the texture and weight of 'a high-end chardonnay',Des Houghton,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/arts-and-culture/celebrated-kiwi-winery-villa-maria-does-the-impossible-by-making-a-55-sauvignon-blanc-that-tastes-more-like-a-highend-chardonnay/news-story/52af41a8d703182581dde51690d55e6e,"Leading New Zealand winemaker David Roper has done the impossible.
He has made a sauvignon blanc for people who don’t really like sauvignon blanc.
As chief winemaker for the Villa Maria group, Mr Roper has spent 11 years experimenting with wildly different parcels of sauvignon blanc fruit from different regions.
His attractive Villa Maria Woven Sauvignon Blanc 2023 ($55) takes savvy to the next level.
Dare I say it the drop has all the hallmarks of high-end chardonnay - richly complex, textural and has what Mr Roper says are the grapes’ “hidden depths”.
It begins with a rush of chamomile and lemon-lime perfumes before the flavours of white pear and ripe peach and gentle spice kick in.
Oak adds structure.
It has a long finish.
Woven was fermented in French oak puncheons and barriques (six per cent new, 94 per cent one-to-three years old).
Mr Roper, whose parents were both science teachers, has kicked the Woven upstairs into Villa Maria’s top-tier icon class.
It is one of the best whites from New Zealand I have tasted.Mr Roper introduced 10 new Villa Maria releases at a luncheon staged recently by House of Fine Wines at Brisbane’s Central Chinese restaurant at 320 Queen St.
We tasted three sauvignon blancs, each with their own personality.
Villa Maris Reserve Sauvignon Blanc 2024 ($35) was served with Sydney rock oysters, Hervey Bay scallops and pickled lotus root.
It showed an array of passionfruit and blackcurrant aromas and tropical fruit flavours.
The zesty Villa Maria Taylors Pass Sauvignon Blanc ($40) came with drunken chicken cooked in aged Shaoxing wine with Hong Kong pineapple buns and crispy prosciutto.
Then came two more wow factor whites. Both were chardonnays served with scallop and prawn dumplings with smoked roe and king crab and prawn spring rolls with garlic chives.
Villa Maria McDiarmid Hill Chardonnay 2022 ($55) was a single vineyard treat with a panoply of tropical fruit, fig and roasted nut flavours followed by the prized Villa Maria Keltern Chardonnay 2022 ($70) with Roper’s icon rating - and looking very much like a white Burgundy with displays of ripe stone fruit, fresh lemon and warm brioche.
The chefs cooked up a storm for the final course.
Triple cooked Stockyard wagyu short ribs with an intriguing Cambodian red kampot pepper and manuka honey, Yangzhou fried rice and char sui prawns juxtaposed with two pinot noirs and a the legendary Ngakirikiri cabernet blend.
Villa Maria’s brooding Attorney Pinot Noir 2021 ($110) was another iconic offering delivering dense black cherry, hot chocolate and spice.
Villa Maria Marlborough Reserve Pinot Noir 2020 ($55) came from handpicked fruit from the Wairau and Awatere valleys.Villa Maria Ngakirikiri 2020 ($150) is the winery's Bordeaux blend.
Ngakirikiri is only made in exceptional years.
This edition comprises cabernet sauvignon (96 per cent) and merlot (4 per cent) and is a powerful and joyful example with a forest floor earthiness below inviting flavours and aromas of black currants, tobacco, spice, cedar and black olives.
It is Villa Maria’s flagship wine and it is outstanding. It completes the firm’s set of icons.
Ngakirikiri’ is a Maori term to describe the unique soils that define the Gimblett Gravels that sits on the former Ngaruroro riverbed.
Air New Zealand, meanwhile, has sought Villa Maria’s help in launching a new wine label, Thirteen Forty Five, offering passengers two signature varietals, a sauvignon blanc and a pinot noir.
Thirteen Forty Five honours the airline’s inaugural flight from Auckland to Sydney in 1940, a distance of 2,164 km.
The wines are also available in Air New Zealand lounges and in Premium Economy cabins on international flights.""
Making a great wine takes time, and Thirteen Forty Five has been a passion project that honours our legacy while creating something special for our customers,’’ the airline’s customer experience manager, Kylie McGillivray-Brown said.
She added it was a good way for travellers to celebrate Air New Zealand’s 85th birthday.
""With every sip, travellers can toast to a legacy that spans miles and decades,” she said.
The sauvignon blanc blends grapes from select vineyards in Marlborough's Wairau and Awatere valleys, offering aromas of passionfruit, lemongrass, and subtle herbal notes.
The pinot noir, sourced from vineyards on the eastern side of the Wairau valley, showcases flavours of cherry and plum with hints of dried herbs and violets.
Air New Zealand showcases a diverse range of New Zealand's finest wines during flights.
The winning wines are chosen in blind tastings by a panel of experts, ensuring the best selection for its Business Premier cabin and lounges, Ms McGillivray-Brown said.
A total of 47 wineries were chosen for the firm’s 2025 wine lists.",SKY News,music

SNL dragged for ‘classless’ skit on Donald Trump-Volodymyr Zelenskyy clash featuring appearance by Mike Myers as Elon Musk,Unknown,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/arts-and-culture/snl-dragged-for-classless-skit-on-donald-trumpvolodymyr-zelenskyy-clash-featuring-appearance-by-mike-myers-as-elon-musk/news-story/fdde07c7e4c6dc3a98410fafedd5f6a9,"“Saturday Night Live” is being dragged for its “classless” skit on President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s heated Oval Office meeting — including a goofy appearance by Mike Myers as Elon Musk.
The cold open attempted to spoof the tense meeting between the two leaders this past week in which Trump warned Zelenskyy that he was “gambling with World War III.”
But, critics on social media slammed the scene as “not funny” and “classless.”
In the NBC show’s rendition, James Austin Johnson’s Trump and Bowen Yang’s Vice President JD Vance can be seen talking over Zelenskyy, who was portrayed by Mikey Day — while Marcello Hernandez’s Secretary of State Marco Rubio cowers on the couch.
“You want to say a few words, maybe tell Mr. Putin how much you love him?” Trump asks Zelenskyy before Vance jumps in to berate the Ukrainian leader, asking him, “What happened to thank you? You haven’t said thank you to us once in the past 15 seconds.”
“You think you’re getting any money from us after your little outburst today?” Vance asks before reciting Gene Wilder’s famous lines from “Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,” “You get nothing. You lose. Good day, sir.”
Trump jumps in, dismissively asking Zelenskyy, “Who shows up to the White House in a T-shirt and jeans like a garbage person?”
Seconds later, Musk barrels onto the screen wearing a T-shirt, jeans, and a jacket while carrying a chainsaw — replicating a move the DOGE Chief actually made on stage at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) last month.
Myers — playing Musk — goofs off with the chainsaw and awkwardly jumps into the air before Trump tells him, “Elon, we love your outfit. Very official and respectful.”
“Donald, what are you doing in my office? You know I’m president now, right?” Musk said before exclaiming, “I’m kidding! I’m kidding! But maybe not, maybe not!”
“Legalize comedy, legalize comedy!” Musk chants while jumping into the air.
Referencing his controversial role at DOGE, where Musk helps eliminate government waste, he said, “We are firing the nonessential employees. Like air traffic controllers.”
“Yes,” Trump said, “sure, some of the planes are going to land upside down. But then the luggage falls right into your lap and you’re ready to go. It’s efficient.”
(The Trump administration has not fired air traffic controllers as part of its cutbacks, and is instead trying to hire more.)
Musk and a DOGE staffer then said that they are producing a new Department of Undoing Child Healthcare and Education, or DOUCHE.
Hours after the show concluded on Sunday, social media users took to X to slam the sketch.
“SNL continues their agenda of not being funny anymore,” one person wrote.
“Might as well be called DNC Live,” another critic added.
While many found the sketch to be funny, other social media users took issue with Myers’s particularly goofy portrayal of Musk.
“Epic FAIL for SNL again. Making fun of someone with autism who not long ago hosted your show? Classless,” one person wrote.
Others also took offense to a T-shirt Myers wore during the show’s closing that read, “Canada is not for sale,” referencing Trump’s proposal to make the US’s northern neighbor the 51st state.
“We’re not BUYING it,” one social media user, clearly in support of Trump’s mission, wrote, with another chiming in: “We will just take it, we don’t need to buy it.”

Man in the US sparks work from home debate after TikTok goes viral of him on a work Zoom call while going through airport security,Preston Potts,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/arts-and-culture/man-in-the-us-sparks-work-from-home-debate-after-tiktok-goes-viral-of-him-on-a-work-zoom-call-while-going-through-airport-security/news-story/403ba03277cbff050efff2460b50cd26,"A traveller has sparked online debate after he was spotted in a viral TikTok going through airport security while on a work zoom call.
The man was spotted with his phone in the tray and a Zoom call running as he went through security in the US.
The work from home employee sparked debate in the comments section over whether this sort of behaviour is crossing the line or completely acceptable.
The co-workers on call seemed to not bat an eyelid, as they carried on as usual while the phone was being screened.
It's most likely the man had his camera turned off so no one realised he was about to board a flight, rather than working from home.
i aspire to be this level of unbothered #tsa #security
Coco Schiffer filmed the act and posted it to TikTok adding: ""I aspire to be this level of unbothered"".
The clip captioned ""honestly sir, respect"" was filled with hundreds of comments in support of him, as many said they have done this before.
One said ""the true meaning of 'road warrior'"", with another jokingly saying ""his resume did say multitasking was a skill"".
The clip, which has been viewed two million times, prompted others to share their work from home antics.
""I was on a team call during boarding, and the lady had to scan my boarding pass QR from my phone. She saw the call going and was like, 'Oh, hi everyone, I'll scan you now',"" one person shared.
Another backed the man up by saying, ""As someone who travels for work I do this all the time so it took me a couple of watches to figure out what was weird about this.""
One was mesmerised as to what the man did for work.
""What are y'all doing for work that allows you to travel so much?! We need a career pivot!""
Workplace expert Roxanne Calder said the airport act is one of the reasons bosses are getting stricter on allowing their employees to work from home.
""This happens all the time and it is why bosses are pushing back,"" she told news.com.au.
Ms Calder said she's seen people on Zoom calls for work in some of the most inappropriate places.
They include cafes and beaches.
""Squeezing work in at the airport or the beach when you know that isn't in policy... it ruins everything,"" she said.
""There's a few people that I know that have gone to Europe to work but also to be home with their families.""
According to 2023 Australian Bureau of Statistics, about 37 per cent of Aussies regularly work from home.
The idea of working from home started to become a new norm following the steady rise of Zoom calls during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The ABS head of labour statistics, Bjorn Jarvis, said ""prior to the pandemic, the percentage of employed people working from home regularly had been steadily increasing by around a percentage point every two years"".
In August, the NSW public sector provided new guidelines to government sector employees for them to work primarily from their workplace rather then their home.
The NSW Premier Chris Minns said people are less productive when they work from home.
""There is a drop in mentorship. There is less of a sense of joint mission,"" Mr Minns said.
The premier's department said it was not ""mandating a particular pattern of attendance"" but said work should be predominantly completed in an ""approved workplace"".",SKY News,music

British-born Matt Preston, who was a judge on MasterChef of Network Ten and My Kitchen Rules on Seven, tells me he has been scouring Hong Kong and Taiwan for unusual restaurants for his tour there next year.
On Hong Kong Island, he found two Michelin-starred restaurants.
And he has a couple of surprise destinations he is keeping secret for his guests.
“We plan to bombard them with flavours and cultural experiences,” he said.
“Our is to give them a once-in-a-lifetime trip they won’t forget.”
With Preston on his reconnaissance mission in Hong Kong and Taipei was chef Gary Mehigan, also born in Britain, a veteran judge from My Kitchen Rules and Plate of Origin.
Preston and Mehigan host so-called Signature Series Food Tours for Luxury Escapes and their next trips to India and Sri Lanka are already booked out.
Luxury Escapes chief executive Adam Schwab said his firm’s research showed 57 per cent Aussie travellers are planning food-inspired trips in 2025.
“Australians are expressing a strong desire for both immersive local dining experiences and enriching cultural experiences,” he said.
The six-night seven-day trip costs $15,499 per person with accommodation at the five-star Peninsula hotel in Hong Kong and the Mandarin Oriental in Taipei.
Restaurant visits are included in the price.
Visitors to Hong Kong usually have to book tables at The Chairman three or four months in advance.
Mr Preston said The Chairman will be a highlight with roast duck, exotic pork and seafood treats.
“A lot of the best places in Hong Kong are not obvious. They may be in a warehouse or tucked into a floor of a grungy looking office building,” he said.
Such is the case with The Chairman and Wing.
“You go up in the list and the doors open to two sumptuous restaurants,” he said.
A current menu lists dishes such as smoked baby pigeon with Longjing tea and chrysanthemum, wild clams stir fried with chilli jam and basil, groper, and The Chairman’s signature soy sauce chicken.
Preston and Mehigan will also escort their guests to the best street food haunts and yum cha.
Mr Preston says Taipei is an oyster-lovers paradise. “They have these amazing little local oysters served crumbed and fried.
“They are also used in omelettes.”
Luxury Escapes is offering other guided tours hosted by MasterChef winner Diana Chan, pro golfer Nick O’Hern, and celebrity chef Miguel Maestre travelling to Malaysia, Vietnam, India, Sri Lanka and Australia’s Red Centre.
Left-hander Nick O’Hern escorts a trip to Vietnam in September next year.
“Travellers will have the unique opportunity to play alongside the world's number 16 golfer on four prestigious courses, as they make their way through Vietnam,” Mr Schwab said.
He said a highlight will be a stay at the luxurious Hyatt Regency Danang Resort and Spa.
Mr Schwab said it wasn’t all about golf.
The tour also includes “immersive cultural experiences” such as exploring Hoi An Ancient Town, a UNESCO-listed heritage port that has been trading for 400 years, and a stroll across the Golden Bridge of Ba Na Hills, described by travel writers as one of the “coolest” bridges on the planet.

British singer Robbie Williams slams critics who accused him of over-promoting new movie during ABC telecast of NYE fireworks,David Wu,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/british-singer-robbie-williams-slams-critics-who-accused-him-of-overpromoting-new-movie-during-abc-telecast-of-nye-fireworks/news-story/8bbd2a8b7f5e9cc6f5728ce80a90ac70,"British singer Robbie Williams has blasted the media and critics who accused him of over-promoting his movie during the ABC telecast of his New Year's Eve performance.
The 50-year-old was paid and flown to Sydney by the taxpayer-funded broadcaster this week to sing a slew of his songs on the night of the world-famous fireworks display.
Ahead of his concert, the former Take That band member seized his opportunity to advertise his biopic Better Man to the masses tuning in on television and the crowd at the event.
""Some critics are calling it the movie of the century! Not my words, except they are because I just made that up,"" he said to the revellers on Tuesday night.
Williams also changed the lyrics of his song Better Man in another push of the film.
The British pop star has since hit back at critics who accused him of over-promotion, after he also shared online a New Year message encouraging people to watch it.
Speaking ahead of his free gig at the Royal Exhibition Building in Melbourne's Federation Square on Thursday afternoon, the singer told his detractors to ""f*** off"".
""Is anybody aware that I got in trouble for over-promoting my film on the TV? What the f*** did they think I was there for?"" he said at the event.
""Get on a plane, come down and sing Angels again? F*** off! I'm here to sell my f***ing movie, you twits. You book Robbie Williams, you get Robbie Williams.""
Williams then calmed down when he realised the criticism rose from taxpayer funds being spent on the singer who used his NYE performance to promote the movie.
""Is the ABC funded by you guys, is that what it is? Oh, soz (sorry) Australia,"" he said.
The 50-year-old took to the stage in the Victorian city on Thursday afternoon, performing a number of hits to fans who lined up hours to see the pop-up show.
A huge crowd packed into Federation Square, which has a capacity of 8,000 people, dancing and singing along to his biggest hits which included Let Me Entertain You.
Williams' biopic depicts the rise and fall of his stardom.
The Brit is portrayed as a chimpanzee in the movie which was filmed in Melbourne.
It is the biggest production in the history of the state and saw the creation of 3,000 jobs and injected $142 million into the economy, the Victorian government said.
Williams finished the free concert by answering fan questions before being given a key to Melbourne to recognise his contribution by the city's Lord Mayor Nicholas Reece.
The singer thanked Australia and promised to return more regularly.
""I feel incredibly at home here, I feel safe, and I also feel loved and embraced,"" he said.
""I want to come and spend your summer here more often. Me coming down to do promo and maybe a tour isn’t good enough for me, it isn’t good enough for my soul.""",SKY News,music
The Museum of Contemporary Art Australia in Sydney to introduce $20 general admission charge amid rising costs,Bryant Hevesi,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/arts-and-culture/the-museum-of-contemporary-art-australia-in-sydney-to-introduce-20-general-admission-charge-amid-rising-costs/news-story/ea9b0e46e3926fdc6f9b3fc59fb7e61e,"Adults will soon have to pay to visit the Museum of Contemporary Art Australia in Sydney after more than two decades of free entry.
The independent, not-for-profit museum on Wednesday revealed it would introduce a $20 general admission fee from January 31 next year.
The concession charge will be $16, while MCA members, under 18s and Australian students will still be able to visit the harbourside museum, located in The Rocks, for free.
The MCA said it was ""disappointed"" to have to impose the entry fee but it was necessary to secure its future amid rising costs and ""stagnant"" government funding.
A statement from the MCA said yearly recurring government funding of $4.36 million only amounts to 14 per cent of operating costs.
It also said that ""current government operational funding is at the same level as it was in 2008"".
""In the absence of an uplift in government funding, as of January 2025, the Museum of Contemporary Art Australia will no longer be in a position to offer free admission to the public,"" MCA Chair Lorraine Tarabay said.
""We are grateful to the government for their continued support, however significant cost escalation combined with stagnant funding has necessitated this move.
""Other museums are owned by government and have funding levels which support free access - this is not the case for MCA Australia, which is funded at a fraction of the government-owned museums.
""We are disappointed to have to introduce a general admission charge however we want to ensure MCA Australia remains a world-class contemporary art museum – one that Sydney deserves. Introducing a general admission charge will help the museum remain sustainable into the future.""
The general public fee will rise to $35 when it includes entry to a major summer or winter exhibition, while for concession card holders it will be $28.
The MCA previously reduced its opening days to six per week amid the cost pressures. It is now closed every Tuesday.
A state government spokesperson told The Sydney Morning Herald an ""independent sustainability review"" was commissioned this year ""to identify operational enhancements to support MCA's ongoing sustainability and success"".
""As with any significant investment from government, the review recommended the MCA prepare a fully evidenced business case that includes transparent financial assumptions and costed initiatives to support its request for additional support,"" they said.",SKY News,music
Aussie beer company Great Northern labelled ‘woke’ after campaign move backfires following criticism from drinkers,Preston Potts,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/arts-and-culture/aussie-beer-company-great-northern-labelled-woke-after-campaign-move-backfires-following-criticism-from-drinkers/news-story/dfd64c42f6df46ac80cad713bc33765c,"The Great Northern Brewing Company has received criticism from its fans following a recent campaign move putting money towards national parks.
The beer brand caused outraged after revealing a campaign – Outdoors for a Cause – was aimed to raise money to buy and protect land for national parks.
This was intended to be in support of the non-profit organisation Foundation for National Parks and Wildlife, according to Yahoo News.
The backlash followed a Facebook group, 4wd TV, calling out the campaign move in a bid to stop what would be money raised for state parks to turn into national parks.
There was fear the freedom to carry out activities like shooting, fishing and off-roading would be reduced due to the funding.
""In an absolutely disgraceful move, Great Northern Brewing Co. has gone woke with a campaign to help get us locked out of forests!"", 4wd TV posted to Facebook.
""Let's save our State Forests! No more National Parks.""
It's understood the campaign was intended to help transform private land into national parks, not state park land.
4wd enthusiasts quickly headed to the comment section to express their thoughts about Great Northern.
""Dammit! Will have to find a new beer now!"" One said.
""The cowards deleted the main post. Shows how much back bone Great Northern Brewing Co. have,"" another said.
One person disagreed and didn't mince their words arguing the beer company was trying to do the right thing to preserve Australia.
""You're peanut mate, they're trying to do the right thing preserving more of this great country for the future, yes it makes it harder to an extent for us to do what we love but if we don't start preserving some of these wildernesses soon they won't be worth saving at all,"" a third added.
In a statement, the head of Great Northern marketing Zac Gelman said the money would no longer be used to buy land for protection.
""Great Northern's Outdoors for a Cause campaign was yesterday paused following feedback from our passionate drinkers,"" Mr Gelman said.
""Our donation to the Foundation for National Parks & Wildlife will now not be used to buy land to add to National Parks. Our donation will instead be used for the preservation of endangered species.
""Whether it's hiking, fishing, 4-wheel-driving or just relaxing, Great Northern drinkers use and preserve their precious spots in the great outdoors, and we support them.""
Senator Matt Canavan spoke on Channel Seven's Sunrise saying businesses should just stick to their knitting and not get involved in political causes.
Why Great Northern are being disowned by the camping and outdoor community  #4wd #camping #4x4 #hunting #country #greatnorthern
""They already have backed down from this, so they have admitted their mistake,"" Mr Canavan said.
""I understand people in the big cities think, 'Let's have more national parks' — that is a great highlighter.
""They become an area where weeds and pests are infested and nobody looks after them. They are a terrible blight on our landscape. That is why there has been that reaction.""
One person posted to 4wd Tv as he drove over a 6-pack of Great Northern in a ""boycott"" move.
Marcus Sutherland uploaded a video to TikTok of him hitting a can of Great Northern before going on a rant about the boycott.
""Here's why everyone is getting rid of their Great Northern's. It's because of you, our forests. And we want people to leave our state forests alone,"" Mr Sutherland said.
Simon Christie from 4wd TV told Yahoo News he was ""proud"" of the ""overwhelming impact"" his company made on Great Northern.

'Tasty solution': ABC star lashed by invasive species expert after telling Aussies to eat cane toads,Patrick Staveley,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/arts-and-culture/tasty-solution-abc-star-lashed-by-invasive-species-expert-after-telling-aussies-to-eat-cane-toads/news-story/9b061d97d262c667836578ba11a9cbac,"An invasive species expert has criticised an up-and-coming ABC documentary series that proposes Australians eat cane toads to eradicate the toxic amphibians.
In a first look of the ABC's upcoming documentary Eat The Invaders, star presenter Tony Armstrong offers a ""tasty solution"" to Australia's burgeoning cane toad crisis, which threatens 75 species of Australian lizards, crocodiles and freshwater turtles.
Armstrong is pictured holding a large knife over a cane toad, while suggesting Australians could turn the pesky creatures into a meal as a solution.
""But what if we could help? By reimagining this problem as a tasty solution,"" he said.
However, the promotional video stunt backfired when an invasive species expert wrote a scathing column, condemning messaging around eating cane toads.
""It’s an appealing pitch and well-intentioned, but the idea that eating Australia’s invasive species can help solve the problem is a fantasy and could make matters worse,"" Carol Booth, a policy analyst at the Invasive Species Council wrote in an editorial for the Sydney Morning Herald.
""This is something the Invasive Species Council raised with the makers of the show back when it was just a concept. Unfortunately, our biology-based message was not so delicious.
""The show, by showcasing these animals as food, risks making their presence more desirable – creating a dangerous paradox that could lead to the further spread of some species.""
It is not the first time the taxpayer has funded journalism pondering whether cane toads should become a dietary staple.
During the COVID pandemic an ABC journalist investigated the issue and concluded there was no safe way to eat a cane toad.
""Our place is crawling with cane toads. I had visions of corralled toads among tiny fences and a fancy new sign on the front gate to our cane-toad stud farm,""environment reporter Nick Kilvert wrote in 2020.
""But before lighting a cigar to celebrate my good fortune, I put in a phone call to toxicologist and cane toad expert Rob Capon from the University of Queensland, who summarily crushed my fledgling dreams.
""'There is not a safe way to eat a cane toad,'"" Professor Capon said, when I asked if the back legs were ok to eat.""
Native species can be killed by just one lick or bite of a cane toad, as they are toxic at all stages of life.
Household pets such as dogs and cats are also at serious risk if they eat or lick a cane toad.
Humans are also understood to be at risk if they attempt to eat a cane toad.
According to the Brisbane City Council, they can cause toxic illness or death to humans if venom is ingested or if their venom enters a human's eye.
The show explores the possibility of humans eating the toxic amphibian though, with a man at one point shown eating what appears to be a Teriyaki cane toad.
In the clip, Armstrong asks the man ""how do you it without dying?"", a question begging to be answered and expected to be explored in the series.
The trailer also shows other dishes involving invasive species being served up including a man eating food off of deer antlers.
The Invasive Species Council raised its concerns with the show when it was a concept and before any production had began, however it plowed ahead with the series.
Ms Booth suggested the show could make the situation worse by making pests desirable if they're presented as food.
""Promoting invasive species as a resource, whether for profit or pleasure, often entrenches problems,"" she wrote.
""The creation of a market for feral goats has led to more goats degrading outback Australia, not fewer. For feral camels, years of talk about sending the meat overseas delayed plans to cull them, resulting in larger numbers.""
She also said she wouldn't be surprised, if the show fails to include warnings about invasive species that the Council requested be included, despite discussions with the series director.
""From our discussions with the series director and scriptwriter Matthew Bate, we think it possible the series will include warnings against the translocation of carp and other pests, but past evidence strongly suggests that warnings are often ignored,"" she said.
""An understanding of biology and psychology are both essential ingredients for effective control, and they tell us there are no easy fixes and that it can be a folly to promote the exploitation of invasive animals.""
Ms Booth also said examples where eating the problem was successful were rare.
She said while the show would raise awareness about the invasive species issue in Australia, she feared it wouldn't provide information about effective control, or the challenges with controlling them.
""While it may be harmless to promote the eating of some species that have already spread to everywhere they can, we hope the show does not mislead the public about the difficulties of controlling invasive species.
""To suggest, as the show’s promo does, that 'you could and should' eat some species into eradication would be laughable if it wasn’t so dangerously wrong.""
In the show's sneak peek preview, Armstrong describes how the existence of Australia's native plants and animals continues to be threatened by invasive species such as cane toads, camels, carp, cats, deer and rabbits.
During the series the host worked with artist and curator Kirsha Kaechele and chef Vince Trim ""to see if we can turn Australia's most destructive invaders into high cuisine.""
The show is set to air from Tuesday January 7 8.30pm on ABC iview and ABC TV.",SKY News,music
Aussie singer-songwriter Hayley Mary speaks out after receiving wave of backlash for wearing MAGA hat in social media post,Patrick Staveley,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/arts-and-culture/aussie-singersongwriter-hayley-mary-speaks-out-after-receiving-wave-of-backlash-for-wearing-maga-hat-in-social-media-post/news-story/0dc81ede75e56d2c4923d0ced1b20543,"Australian rocker Hayley Mary has revealed the full extent of the backlash she has received after posting an image of herself wearing a Trump MAGA cap on social media.
The 37-year-old singer-songwriter and member of the Jezabels, who are currently on hiatus, shared the image after Trump was re-elected by the American public in the 2024 US Presidential election.
She said she posted the picture of herself in the hat for ""shock value"" to get the attention of her followers as she condemned Labor's misinformation bill in the following slides on the post captioned: ""TRIGGER WARNING!! I'm pressing the f*** it button with this one. And, yeah it's a #MAGA hat... Swipe for reasons why...""
Mary claimed the misinformation bill ""seriously suppresses freedom of speech"" of all people in Australia.
""I am not an expert on it and I'm sure I'll get 'schooled' shortly but as I understand it the bill received tens of thousands of objections and was heavily critiqued for infringing on our human rights by the Australian Human Rights Commission, the Victorian Bar Association, the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance and Meta among others,"" she said.
The post was met with hundreds of angry comments, with many accusing it of being ""misguided"".
Aboriginal Australian rapper Briggs was among those slamming the post, commenting: ""What a s**t take. You should've pressed the ""delete"" button"".
Mary, who has just celebrated the release of her first solo album, Roman XS, told the Herald Sun in the interview the post may have been ""silly timing"" but said she was willing to risk her career in order to warn her followers about the misinformation bill.
“The fallout was everything you could imagine. I probably no longer have a music career in the way that I knew it,” she said.
“I’ve lost some friends, though I hope that’s temporary. I’ve lost some of the infrastructure of my business; publicity, band members, crew members, a show, my album launch, some revenue and quite a few followers.
“I was aware of what would happen. But I think the (Misinformation) Bill is dangerous enough to risk my career over.”
Mary said she also had a lot of people reaching out to show their support to her in the wake of the scrutiny she copped.
She also spoke about the visceral reaction people had towards the MAGA slogan in general and suggested whether they needed to ""change"" their response to it.
“I know the MAGA movement is different things to different people, but (it also represents) the president of the free world and 73 million people voted for him, so I’m not sure if we need to change our relationship with it,"" she said.
“They have spent their lives trying to bully people out of careers. The irony is, I’ve… cancelled myself. There’s nothing for you to do here.”
The singer, who won an ARIA Music Award with The Jezabels, and supported Oasis singer Liam Gallagher as a solo artist in 2022, has put a call out for venues who would be willing to have her perform there to reach out to her as she stated she was ""better at music than at activism"".",SKY News,music
"'Where the rainforest meets the ocean': Far north Queensland's Wangetti Trail set to become 'one of the world's great hiking, biking tracks'",Des Houghton,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/arts-and-culture/where-the-rainforest-meets-the-ocean-far-north-queenslands-wangetti-trail-set-to-become-one-of-the-worlds-great-hiking-biking-tracks/news-story/cc1a593991fe2b2bcb63187a811f310f,"Queensland is charging ahead with what Tourism Minister Andrew Powell says will be one of the world’s great hiking and biking trails.
And part of it is already built.
Hugging the coast from Palm Cove to Port Douglas, the 94km Wangetti Trail will embrace far north Queensland’s stunning coastline and wet tropics where the rainforest meets the ocean.
Mr Powell said the multi-million-dollar trail would cut through an area of spectacular ocean views, waterfalls and a rich array of flora and fauna.
Overseas travellers are searching for unique, nature-based holiday experiences and Queensland could deliver them in spades, he said.
Travellers on foot or on bike on the Wangetti Trail may carry their own tents and put them up on sleeping platforms.
Or they could arrive at campsites operated by the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service.
They may bed down in affordable, rustic, and privately operated bunk houses or upscale five-star chalets and eco cabins.
“The Premier (David Crisafulli) wants to blend the environment and tourism portfolios to create spectacular attractions,” he said.
“This will be one of them.“Imagine walking into an immaculate accommodation space with a spa and chef ready to cook a degustation with a bottle of St Henri, already decanted.
“You enjoy the night and get on the trail the next morning and keep going.“That’s what we will put to the market in the coming months.”
Mr Powell said the Wangetti Trail was inspired by similar trails in Tasmania and New Zealand that attracted private investment.
The landscape of the Wet Tropics provided something quite different.
Travellers would enter the world of the endangered southern cassowary, rufous owl and grey goshawk and the vulnerable Macleay’s fig-parrot.
Hikers and bikers can expect to be surrounded by giant trees, vibrant flora, the sounds of tropical birds and insects and animals like the musky rat-kangaroo.
Once complete Wangetti Trail will traverse a World Heritage area and three national parks with breathtaking panoramic views of Double Island, Trinity Beach and Cairns.
And there will be an opportunity for croc-spotting along the Mowbray River.
The 7.8km section of the trail, from Palm Cove to Ellis Beach, has already been opened.
It takes around three hours to hike and 45 minutes to ride one way.
The trail is rated a grade three, which is suitable for most ages and fitness levels, with a few sharp turns and steep narrow sections.Transport awaits travellers who make the trip.
The Wangetti Trail was first proposed by the previous Queensland government but was plagued by holdups, budget blowouts and a lack of transparency, Mr Powell said.
“Labor announced the Trail in 2018 as a nation-leading project, yet the first section wasn’t opened until 2024 – two years behind schedule,” he told Parliament.
“It has become the most expensive footpath in Australia – with $22.5 million spent to deliver just over seven km of a 94km project.
“Almost half the budget has been spent on just eight per cent of the project – 7.8km.
“It’s clear there were serious missteps with delays in approvals, uncertainty about the trail’s purpose and a lack of consultation with locals who know the area and the market for activity-based tourism.’’
He told the House that his Assistant Minister for Tourism, Bree James, the Member for Barron River, was helping to get the project back on track.",SKY News,music
'Sonic seasoning' music pairing trend takes Jack Daniel's 'Triple Mash Bottled in Bond' whiskey experience to a new level,Des Houghton,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/arts-and-culture/sonic-seasoning-music-pairing-trend-takes-jack-daniels-triple-mash-bottled-in-bond-whiskey-experience-to-a-new-level/news-story/5589a22aa3903181b634044f61bd292f,"Turn on some music when you pour yourself a Jack Daniel’s whiskey or a glass of champagne and it will taste up to 20 per cent better.
So says Charles Spence, a researcher who coined the term, “sonic seasoning”.
I would not have believed him had he not been a professor at the esteemed University of Oxford.
Mr Spence, 55, is professor of experimental psychology and head of the Crossmodal Research Laboratory at Oxford and has been experimenting with sound and flavour for more than two decades.
“We can’t use music to turn water into wine, but we can take a complex tasting experience and enhance peoples’ enjoyment of wine and spirits - not with words but with music,” he said.
Mr Spence is in demand globally, helping to create bespoke music to enhance the flavour of coffee, chocolate, ice cream, whisky, beer and champagne.
A recent challenge in the US was to curate music to suit new sauces produced by the Italian multinational Barilla, the world’s largest pasta company.
The firm was started in 1877 by Pietro Barilla in his bakery in Parma.
In his taste trials Mr Spence asks groups of people to pick the musical notes to match the flavours he gives them including salty, sweet, sour, savory, spicy creamy and slightly acidic solutions.
“We put them in front of a virtual keyboard on a computer where you can pick the sounds of a piano, brass, strings, woodwind, you name it … high tempo, low tempo and so on,” Mr Spence said.
“People think it is a bit strange but if you get 20 people or they often match bitter tastes with low pitched sounds.
“If we give them something sweet to taste they will pick a high note, usually.”
He devises “musical menus”.
In Australia recently he helped curate country music songs for Jack Daniel’s latest whiskey, ‘Triple Mash Bottled in Bond’.
Be warned: It is 100 proof, yielding an ABV (alcohol by volume) of 50 per cent.
For Jack Daniel’s Triple Mash Mr Spence enlisted the help of String Musicians Australia.
The ensemble paired country music instruments including acoustic guitar, fiddle, and double bass to “elevate” the Triple Mash tasting profile of grassy herbs and peppery spice, rich toasted oak and deep caramel, and honeyed, toasted granola.
Mr Spence was happy with the result he described as a feast for the senses honouring Triple Mash’s unique blend of three bottled-in-bond whiskeys.
“By applying this knowledge to the world of country music, we’ve been able to create something incredibly different - a composition that is scientifically proven to complement your whiskey-drinking experience, while remaining quintessentially country,” Mr Spence said.
Jack Daniel’s Master Distiller Chris Fletcher made a super-premium whiskey featuring a blend of three straight bottled-in-bond whiskeys: Jack Daniel's ‘Bonded Rye Whiskey’, Jack Daniel's ‘Bonded Tennessee Whiskey’ and Jack Daniel's ‘Bonded American Malt Whiskey’.
Bottles of whiskey and gin tucked in a hamper make great Christmas gifts. And they are not without mystery.Edinburgh Gin has launched an appealing watermelon and lime gin ($65).
How on earth do they source watermelons in Scotland?
This Edinburgh Gin is an appealing summertime drink with the sweetness of the melon juxtaposed against a sharp jolt of tartness from the lime.
‘Yellowstone Select Kentucky Straight Bourbon’ ($109) may be just the drink to support marathon binges of the Western-themed television drama ‘Yellowstone’ set against the glorious scenery of Montana and starring Kevin Costner, until he was dramatically written out of the story.

"'Bargain buy of the year': $16 Taylors Estate Merlot wins bundle of trophies, 32 gold medals at top international wine shows",Des Houghton,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/arts-and-culture/bargain-buy-of-the-year-16-taylors-estate-merlot-wins-bundle-of-trophies-32-gold-medals-at-top-international-wine-shows/news-story/f9765b3c18cdc082589cd5a6a5509f70,"A $16 bottle of Australian red has emerged as a giant killer by winning a bundle of trophies and 32 gold medals at recent international wine shows.
Taylors Estate Merlot from South Australia’s Clare Valley triumphed again when it won another trophy and a “double gold” rating at the San Francisco International Wine Competition.
Judges awarded it 97, a score usually reserved for highfalutin wines from mainstays like Penfolds, Henschke and Elderton.
Taylors Merlot must surely be now in the running for the bargain buy of the year.
I got five bottles at my local Dan Murphy’s for $15.95 each.
Taylors Merlot is a perfumed steamroller of gentle power and drinkability.
It was plush and round with captivating blackcurrant, plum and black cherry fruit flavours and mineral notes.
The San Fran judges’ tasting note hailed its “extremely fruity with pronounced cherry aromas”.
It added: “The palate features firm, well-ripened tannins with brisk acidity and an assortment of red and dark fruits with spice and well-seasoned oak notes. The finish is long, smooth, and fruity, with lingering oak notes.”
As well as snatching the trophy in San Francisco, Taylors Merlot has won trophies in the last two years at the New Zealand International Wine Show, at the Dan Berger International Wine Competition in the USA, the China Wine and Spirits Awards in Hong Kong and the American Wine Society Competition.
It has won gold in Spain, Italy, Belgium, Austria, the UK, Argentina, Korea, New Zealand and South Africa.
In San Francisco the wine was entered into the show as Wakefield Estate 2023 Merlot, the name the Taylors use in some overseas markets.
The winning fruit came from a vineyard known as St Andrews A 50, one of the oldest on the Taylor’s family estate.
The run of success is a tribute to the skills of chief winemaker Adam Eggins.
How does he approach merlot, a difficult grape.
“A wise man once said a merlot should smell like cabernet - which is all about mint and cassis and violets - and should feel like a medium-bodied, soft shiraz,” he said.
“It should be round and voluptuous and creamy and soft… and that is what we are trying to make.
“We have been having a lot of fun with merlot. It’s a ridiculous price for a wine scoring 97 points.”
Oddly, the wine has been overlooked by Australian critics.
Mr Eggins said a breakthrough came when the 2021 vintage picked up two trophies.
There were two more for the following vintage and two more for the vintage after that.
“We have had a stunning couple of years with merlot,” he said.
“We get it nice and ripe in the Clare, it’s something about the climate. Some of our merlot textures and colours can be quite rich.”
Mr Eggins said a veteran winemaker whose judgement he trusts urged him to “flaunt it”.
“They are really delicious wines. It’s hard to explain but we sort of make them like we make shiraz, trying to find roundness and softness and richness while keeping the fruit bright and fresh,” he said.
Despite his success Mr Eggins says it is hard for him to celebrate because of drought.
""It is one of the worst droughts we have had in 33 years. The grain farmers are saying their crops are coming in at 40 per cent of their usual harvest,” he said.
“It’s been a very, very dry year. We haven’t had any real rain since October.
“We will be finished (harvesting) in two or three weeks, which is amazing.
“It’s one of the earliest vintages we have had.
“The plants are just panicking because of a lack of rain.”
Why?
“The real answer is something to do with a vineyard’s water capacity. It’s a combination of things. It’s a bit like the soil equivalent of terroir. If you have good soils and good plants and good, healthy systems due to mulching and your water availability, that is your total water capacity,” he said.
“If you don’t, the vines are just racing forward, sensing the pending drought so the grapes are ripening almost too quickly.
“We’ll finish the whites next week and that is about a month ahead in time. But I don’t think it is global warming, I think it is a drought effect.”
Even the lovely old trees in the valley were showing signs of heat stress.
“I reckon we will be done and dusted by the end of March, way ahead of time,” he said.
Despite his water fears he said the growing season was near perfect with 30C day temperatures and cooling 13C nights.
“We have had days and days of beautiful weather for ripening grapes,"" he said.
“A lot of shiraz is showing very small berries so I think we are going to make wine for Superman - some pretty concentrated, purple and black wines.
“We should make some stunners.
“The riesling is stunning as well. It is so resilient it has done well despite the drought.
“And the cabernet is showing some wonderful aromatics.”
However, he feels for dryland growers without a lot of water capacity.
“It is going to be a tough year for them,” he said.",SKY News,music

Fireworks will set off from 264 firing points on the Harbour Bridge on the big day next week, including from the western side for the first time.
Almost 1 million people are expected to watch the spectacle unfold.
More than 9 tonnes of fireworks will illuminate the Sydney skies, with the show also expected to feature animal-shaped effects, drones and Australian-first aerial platforms for the fireworks to be set off from.
Seventh-generation pyrotechnician Fortunato “Forch” Foti, creative director of Foti Fireworks, has been in charge of Sydney's fireworks extravaganza for 21 years and this year, he says, it will be the ""most innovative"".
“Not only do we have more fireworks than ever before, we’re extremely excited to introduce the aerial platforms concepts — the first time this has been done in Australian fireworks history,” Mr Foti said.
“Basically we have four drones which have almost 600 pyrotechnical effects.
“The introduction of 80 new positions on the bridge and an additional firing location on the western side has enabled us to extend the footprint of the display and offer people a better view of the fireworks. No matter where you are around the Harbour, you are in for a great show.
“We have a lot of new effects this year… for the first time we are firing on the western side of the bridge, we are trying to give the west the same feel as what the east is getting.”
City of Sydney Lord Mayor Clover Moore added the stunning fireworks will be a true reflection of what the Harbour city is all about.
“With 26,500 lights and 9 tonnes of fireworks to be fired off 8 floating platforms and from 80 new positions on the western side of the Bridge, we’ll be lighting up 7km of Sydney Harbour from Cockatoo Island to Point Piper and beyond,” she said.
This year's festivities are also expected to bring in more than a whopping $170 million for the economy, according to Business NSW CEO Daniel Hunter.
“NYE celebrations are estimated to account for $176 million of economic activity in NSW, two-thirds of which ($117 million) are in the Sydney CBD,” he said.",SKY News,music
Parramatta light rail service opens for the first time as locals wake up early to experience the historic moment,Sumaiya Chowdhure,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/arts-and-culture/parramatta-light-rail-service-opens-for-the-first-time-as-locals-wake-up-early-to-experience-the-historic-moment/news-story/7ee65fbe3d4da33f6460e63e468e16da,"Its been an exciting day for Western Sydney on Friday morning with the Parramatta light rail service officially opening for the first time in 80 years.
Many locals woke up bright and early to witness the historic moment as the light rail service in ""Sydney's second CBD"" was a long time coming.
The new L4 Westmead & Carlingford Line has been five years in the making due to major testing and delays but the speedy tram can now carry up to 400 passengers, making it easier for locals and visitors to move through the bustling streets of Parramatta.
The light rail line provides connections to key destinations, including the Westmead Health Precinct, CommBank Stadium, Riverside Theatres, over 60 cafes and restaurants on and around Church Street, Parramatta Square, Rosehill Gardens Racecourse, and three Western Sydney University campuses.
The L4 line is set to be run on a weekday timetable, with initial services running every 9 minutes between 7am to 7pm, every 12 minutes between 5am and 7am and 7pm and 11pm, and every 16 minutes between 11pm to 1am.
This morning the opening passenger service saw three light rail trams commence concurrently from the Westmead and Carlingford light rail stops at 5:00am, and Parramatta Square at 5:02am.
Testing and commissioning of the Parramatta light rail stage 1 project cost an estimated $2.875 billion.
Stage 2 of the project to extend stage 1 and further extend services between Ermington and Olympic Park, is already underway with the the Minns Labor Government committing $2.1 billion to see its completion.
Deputy Premier and Minister for Western Sydney Prue Car said, ""The opening of this significant transport link is a big investment in the future of Parramatta"".
By 2026, around 22,000 people are expected to use Parramatta Light Rail every day, with an estimated 130,000 people living within walking distance of the 16 light rail stops.
Transport Minister Jo Haylen said it had been “a long wait for the people of western Sydney”.
“This is a great day because we need more public transport services for these fast growing communities,” Ms Haylen said.
“More than 130,000 people live within walking distance of 16 new stops along 12km of line. We know this is going to be a game changer for people to get to work, to connect to each other, for kids to get to school. It’s great news for businesses as well.
“For the first time in 80 years we’re gonna have a tram running with passengers down the centre of Parramatta.”
The opening of the Paramatta light rail services comes after the Rail, Tram and Bus Union (RTBU) threatened another strike over pay and implementing 24-hour services this week.
The New South Wales government on Thursday afternoon lost its bid in the Federal Court to block the union from further industrial action.
The South Coast Line between Wollongong and Bomaderry has already hauled to a complete shutdown under protected industrial action.
Tens of thousands of commuters were left scrambling on Friday morning to figure out alternative plans due to 80 cancellations across the network.
The industrial action is expected to bring glum over the holiday period as well as commuters may face complete shutdowns and major delays on New Year's Eve - the busiest day of the year for public transport - as people travel across the city for the fireworks.
NSW Transport Minister Jo Haylen on Friday described the strikes as ""significant"", adding the state government was taking ""every step available"" to ""protect"" its customers and businesses ahead of Christmas and New Year's Eve.",SKY News,music
Disney ‘doesn’t know what to do’ with outspoken star Rachel Zegler: Inside the ‘Snow White’ movie nightmare,Unknown,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/arts-and-culture/disney-doesnt-know-what-to-do-with-outspoken-star-rachel-zegler-inside-the-snow-white-movie-nightmare/news-story/255025a1a375af6ec6e4140cf548f736,"Rachel Zegler won’t sing “Some Day My Prince Will Come” in Disney’s new live-action remake of “Snow White.”
This princess doesn’t need a man and will instead warble the girl-boss anthem “Waiting on a Wish.”
But given all the controversy around the movie, in theaters March 21, it might be a long wait.
Variety reported this week that there will be none of the typical red-carpet interviews for the film’s premiere at the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood on Saturday — perhaps to avoid tough questions about the backlash that’s followed Snow White around like an eighth dwarf.
It comes as Disney alienates fans, and suffers at the box office, by leaning into DEI initiatives, pushing gender ideologies in cartoons and adding content warnings to classic films like “Dumbo.”
It really began with star Rachel Zegler — a Latina actress who rose to fame in Steven Spielberg’s “West Side Story” remake and who has been very outspoken in her #FreePalestine support — trashing the original story from the 1937 Disney classic.
“There’s a big focus on her love story with a guy who literally stalks her. Weird. So we didn’t do that this time. I was scared of the original version. I think I watched it once and never picked it up again,” Zegler, 23, told Variety in 2022.
And while the song “Some Day My Prince Will Come” has long stood as a Disney classic, Zegler announced last summer at D23, the annual Disney expo, that her Snow White is “not going to be saved by the prince. She’s not going to be dreaming about true love. She’s dreaming about becoming the leader she knows she can be.”
This attitude has upset David Hale Hand, whose late father, Disney animator David Hand, was the supervising director for “Bambi” and the original “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.”
Hand told Page Six he won’t be buying a ticket for the woke new film.
“The original was the way it should be. From what I’ve read, [the new film] bears no reflection to the original story,” said Hand, 93.
“It’s so far off base that it’s ridiculous.”
In fact, he believes, it’s enough to make his father and Walt Disney “roll in their graves.”
“They’ve taken it and moved into the politics of what is woke … They’re taking a beautiful and beautifully drawn story and destroying what was ‘Snow White.’ Why can’t they just leave it alone instead of coming up with a different story — make it a totally different character?”
Hand’s wife, Sandra Hand, added.
“David’s father took so much pride in the film and he would say, ‘What have you done?'”
It’s a question many people were asking after early filming shots emerged last year showing Zegler’s stand-in leading a line of “dwarfs” of varying sizes and genders.
That led actor Jason Acuña — known as “Wee Man” in the “Jackass” franchise — to slam the studio: “You’re replacing jobs that people could have as little people,” he told Movie Maniac in 2023. “It’s for dwarfs. Why are you hiring ‘Snow White and the seven average people’?”
Another ruckus was raised when the trailer showed the actors had been replaced by CGI characters, although the Hollywood Reporter said this week that director Marc Webb had always planned to use CGI.
A representative from Disney did not return Page Six’s request for comment.
Meanwhile, Actor Peter Dinklage — who, like Acuña, has achondroplasia, a form of dwarfism — was annoyed that the movie seemed hypocritical in its woke efforts.
“They were very proud to cast a Latina actress as Snow White, but you’re still telling the story of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Take a step back and look at what you’re doing there,” Dinklage told podcaster Marc Maron last year.
When the first trailer for the movie was shown last August at D23, Zegler didn’t waste the chance to express her woke views.
“love you all so much! thank you for the love and for 120m views on our trailer in just 24 hours! what a whirlwind…and always remember, free palestine,” she tweeted on X.
The actress has since continued her outspokenness on the matter and was forced to apologize after a lengthy Instagram post wishing that President Trump and his supporters would “never know peace” after he defeated Kamala Harris last November.
“Disney’s lead actress is out of control,” a movie insider told Page Six. “They don’t know what to do … she’s an outspoken 20-something and Disney chiefs have called her directly and asked her to tone down her posts. They’ve called her management, but she won’t listen.
“It’s been this way the entire way through filming. But it’s the tying of her politics to ‘Snow White’ that is upsetting.”
Sandra Hand agreed: “Snow White is a lovely young woman who has love for her prince and her seven dwarves — she’s not someone brandishing a Palestinian flag.”
Zegler’s rep did not return a request for comment.
Adding another twist to the story is the fact that the Evil Queen in “Snow White” is played by Gal Gadot, 39, who has been a passionate supporter of her homeland of Israel, particularly since the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attacks.
The two actresses, who Page Six is told got along well during filming, presented the Best Visual Effects award at the Oscars earlier this month — where some filmmakers protested Gadot’s presence.A virtual open letter, allegedly signed by 21 Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences members and more than 75 other filmmakers, called for the Oscars to “reconsider Gal Gadot’s presence” because the “Wonder Woman” star has “openly and repeatedly expressed her support for Israel’s military actions against Palestinians.”
“They spent a few hours trying to get Gal removed from the Oscars,” said one Hollywood source. “It was disgusting.”
Nisha Pahuja, the Canadian director of the Oscar-nominated documentary “To Kill a Tiger,” confirmed to Page Six that she had signed the petition. Other alleged signers, including “Monsoon Wedding” director Mira Nair, did not return requests for confirmation.
Academy sources told Page Six the petition was not submitted before the ceremony, but a Hollywood source said Gadot learned of it shortly before taking the stage.
“Gal has been nothing but dignified throughout all of this,” said the Hollywood source. “But it’s hurtful.”
Despite reports that Disney axed a planned London premiere for “Snow White,” we’re told there were never plans for such an event.
Zegler, however, has been to Japan and Spain to promote the film and will be joining screenings before opening day.
“Disney is leaning towards having influencers to interview Rachel and Gal for promotion days on Sunday and Monday,” an industry insider in the know told Page Six of the decision to avoid traditional red carpets. “They want to concentrate on the content.”As the cultural tides have shifted over recent months, Disney has pulled back from some of its DEI moves.
But it remains to be seen whether “Snow White” will haunt the company for years to come or serve as a fairytale end to a try-hard era.

'Take 2': Comedian's cheeky dig as musical about breakdancer Raygun is rebranded following threat of legal action,Patrick Staveley,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/arts-and-culture/take-2-comedians-cheeky-dig-as-musical-about-breakdancer-raygun-is-rebranded-following-threat-of-legal-action/news-story/a9e1b9c992719472ec8982343a07bee0,"A musical about Aussie breakdancer Rachael 'Raygun' Gunn has been rebranded after the plug was abruptly pulled on its opening show earlier this month.
Comedian Stephanie Broadbridge revealed just under two weeks ago her trial show for Raygun: The Musical was cancelled just hours before it was set to premiere in Sydney, after the breaker's lawyers contacted the venue and threatened legal action.
Broadbridge told her Instagram followers Raygun's lawyers trademarked the poster for the musical and advised the comedian she was not allowed to do the kangaroo dance because the Olympian who went viral for her performance in Paris ""owns"" it.
The 37-year-old also trademarked the use of her name.
On Thursday, Broadbridge shared an update on Instagram, revealing the musical had been rebranded.
The tongue-in-cheek new poster features the silhouette of a kangaroo in Raygun's most memorable pose. The title has been changed to Breaking: The Musical.
The tagline, ""A completely legal parody musical"" is also a cheeky dig directed at Raygun.
The post was captioned ""Take 2"" as the musical prepares to finally get off the ground in the new year.
Dates are scheduled from February 28 to March 2 in Adelaide at the Fringe Festival, as well as a run of four shows from May 7 to May 10 in Sydney.
The show is also set to be taken to Melbourne in April but specific dates are yet to be confirmed.
Tickets are currently available for Adelaide, while those planning to see the show in Melbourne and Sydney will have to wait.
Broadbridge received several supportive comments on her post, while many poked fun at the legal challenge from Raygun and her team.
""This is perfect... don't think you could have planned this any better,"" one commented.
""Couldn't have asked for better publicity than Raygun trying to get this cancelled,"" another said.
""I'm suing you for the unlawful use of that font. Also, I've trademarked that particular shade of Yellow,"" a third joked.
The update comes after it emerged that Gunn’s lawyers, 17 Degrees, are demanding the musical's promoter and Darlinghurst's iD Comedy Club owner Anthony Skinner pay at least $10,000 in legal fees.
Mr Skinner, who was planning to send the proceeds from the show to a women's shelter, offered $500 but this was “completely rejected” by the firm, as revealed in a letter from 17 Degrees lawyer Samantha Ludemann.
“You will reimburse our client with legal costs to date which we estimate to be $10,000,” the letter stated as an “absolute undertaking” Mr Skinner was required to agree to.
The other conditions included cancelling the proposed show, removing all references to Gunn and her likeness from promotions and advertising, and providing evidence of the cancellation of the show.",SKY News,music
Australian comedian forced to shut down Raygun: The Musical after facing threats of legal action from breakdancer's team,Sumaiya Chowdhure,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/arts-and-culture/australian-comedian-forced-to-shut-down-raygun-the-musical-after-facing-threats-of-legal-action-from-breakdancers-team/news-story/af04ee45b9ccbd09d136ac440b082fcc,"Raygun: The Musical parody has been abruptly shut down by Australian B-girl Rachael 'Raygun' Gunn's legal team just hours before its much-awaited Saturday night debut at the iD Comedy Club in Darlinghurst.
The news comes after the writer of the musical, Australian comedian Steph Broadbridge, faced threats of legal action from Gunn's lawyers and the show's promoter, iD Comedy Club, received several letters asking not to use the name ""Raygun"" or the infamous ""kangaroo dance"" over concerns for her intellectual property.
Gunn reportedly applied to have the name ""RAYGUN"" trademarked in August but the application still remains under investigation.
However, the same day Broadbridge first promoted Raygun: The Musical on Instagram, Gunn filed to trademark a silhouette image of her performing the kangaroo dance, which has since been accepted.
The Aussie comedian announced the cancellation of Raygun: The Musical on Saturday morning via a post to her official Instagram account.
“Raygun’s lawyers got in touch with the venue and threatened legal action so we will be refunding everyone their $10 or comp ticket back for that,” Broadbridge said in a video on Instagram.
“Her lawyers trademarked my poster, which is flattering. I hope they do something fun with that.
“They were also worried that I was damaging her brand, which I would never do. She doesn’t need me to do that.""
The parody was promoted as ""an exploration of Rachael ""Raygun"" Gunn’s journey to the 2024 Paris Olympics"", infused with comedic elements, satirical exaggerations and musical comedy tropes.
The script also included songs such as You May Be a B-girl But You’ll Always Be an A-girl To Me, and I’m Breaking Down and I Would Have Won But I Pulled a Muscle.
“They also said I wasn’t allowed to do the dance because she owns the kangaroo dance. That one did puzzle me,” Broadbridge further claimed.
“That’s an Olympic-level dance, how would I possibly be able to do that without any formal breakdancing training?
“Anyway, to alleviate the concerns of Raygun’s lawyers I will be changing the name of the character to ‘Raigun’ with an i. I hope that fixes everyone’s concerns.”
In a statement published by Raygun’s talent agency Born Bred, they said the intention of the legal action was to ensure Gunn's brand was ""properly represented"" and protected in all future endeavours.
“We would like to clarify that Rachael Gunn’s management and legal team is committed to protecting her intellectual property and ensuring that her brand remains strong and respected,” Born Bred said.
Gunn's team further said, the use of Raygun by Broadbridge had caused confusion amongst the public, ""potentially leading them to believe [the musical] had Rachael’s endorsement or approval”.
“While we have immense respect for the credible work and effort that has gone into the development of the show, we must take necessary steps to safeguard Rachael’s creative rights and the integrity of her work,” they said.
Broadbridge confirmed those who purchased tickets for the musical will be refunded and she still plans to put the show on next year with adjustments.",SKY News,music
Spotify Wrapped 2024: Taylor Swift reigns supreme among Australian music lovers for second consecutive year,Patrick Staveley,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/arts-and-culture/spotify-wrapped-2024-taylor-swift-reigns-supreme-among-australian-music-lovers-for-second-consecutive-year/news-story/77b01fe5197ea59dd0a38750bb559f79,"Spotify Wrapped 2024 has dropped, giving music lovers worldwide the opportunity to review their listening habits of the past year.
The Wrapped feature has been immensely popular since it was added by Spotify in 2015 as a 'Year in Music' before being rebranded in 2016.
Spotify users were growing impatient ahead of this year's release as it took notably longer to come out compared to previous iterations.
Following the release of her highly-anticipated 11th studio album, The Tortured Poets Department, Taylor Swift has been named Spotify's Global Top Artist for the second year in a row.
She has also come in as Australia's favourite artist for a fourth year straight, beating out rapper Drake, country singer Zach Bryan, 'Birds of a Feather' songstress Billie Eilish and The Weeknd who recently played sell-out shows in Melbourne and Sydney.
While also remaining popular amongst adults, children's music group The Wiggles has been ranked Australia's top local artist again, with The Kid LAROI coming in at second - the same outcome as in 2023.
AC/DC and Vance Joy have also featured in the top five local acts again coming in at third and fourth after finishing fifth and third, respectively, in 2023.
The one new addition is RÜFÜS DU SOL who comes in at number five, replacing Flume who dropped out.
Incredibly, Vance Joy's 2013 hit Riptide was Australia's top local song for 2024.
Benson Boone's Beautiful Things was Australia's favourite song of the year, beating out Sabrina Carpenter's Espresso which topped the global list.
Carpenter experienced a breakout year, which included the release of her hit single and record Short 'n' Sweet, following her support of Swift on the star's Eras Tour Down Under.
Her new album came in at no.2 for Australian listeners, below Swift's fresh release.
While her viral song didn't crack Australia's top five, Billie Eilish's album HIT ME HARD AND SOFT came in at no.3 Down Under and no.2 globally.
In addition to music listening, podcasts and audiobooks are a popular source of entertainment for Aussies.
The Joe Rogan Experience remains the most listened to podcast in the country and the world.
Almost two years after its release, Prince Harry's memoir Spare was Australia's top audiobook across premium Spotify users, with Trent Dalton's Lola in the Mirror the preferred local audiobook.

"High on flavour, low on price: $25 drops from Chateau Tanunda as the historic winery celebrates its 135th anniversary",Des Houghton,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/arts-and-culture/high-on-flavour-low-on-price-25-drops-from-chateau-tanunda-as-the-historic-winery-celebrates-its-135th-anniversary/news-story/5aeb53c0d73e4db5ad79b9a7175d7399,"The bells are ringing at Chateau Tanunda, home of some of Australia’s oldest vines.
The tolling of the 100-year-old bell by senior winemaker Jeremy Ottawa and his team welcomed the new vintage as the winery celebrates its 135th anniversary.
Château Tanunda was established in 1890 at Basedow Road, Tanunda in South Australia.
It is literally rooted in Australian winemaking with rows of Centenarian Vines, a hundred or more years old, and Ancestor Vines that are 125 years of age, or older.
Fruit from these old-timers go to make Chateau Tanunda’s “Old Vine Expressions” collection.
“We are spending a lot of time in our vineyards to select the best fruit at their optimal picking perfection. We expect the berries to be small and the flavour intensity high,” says Ottawa.
The historic, Bavarian-style chateau is a commanding double-story edifice with a 21-metre tower.
It was a derelict ruin when John Geber happened to cycle past it in 1998.
He didn’t know it at the time, but he was looking at Australia’s oldest and largest wine chateau with vines first planted on the estate in 1845.
The South African-born lawyer turned tea tycoon, bought the property the next day from Southcorp without seeing inside it.
Mr Geber fell in love with the chateau at first site and reportedly spent $8 million faithfully restoring it.
Château Tanunda, 71km northeast of Adelaide is a tourist drawcard with guided tours and wine tastings.
It has 350 acres of vines, a croquet lawn and a cricket oval that has hosted over 40 former international cricketers.
It attracts more than 100,000 visitors a year Michelle Geber, the managing director and daughter of the man who saved it, has said.
The winery produces shiraz and cabernet sauvignon, chardonnay, riesling, semillon, grenache, a grenache, shiraz, mourvèdre blend and a dry rose made from merlot and shiraz.
Prices start at $25.
Chateau Tanunda's flagship wines bear the name Everest and are at the pinnacle of the winery's winemaking philosophy, Ms Geber said.
The Everest Shiraz 2020 and the Everest Old Vine Grenache 2018 ($330) are only produced in the most exceptional vintages, she said.
“Chateau Tanunda has been historically strong in exports, and during our 135th anniversary year we are particularly focused on building the winery here at home, especially with our renowned Grand Barossa wines, which are currently experiencing strong double digit growth in Australia,” she said.",SKY News,music
'I just cannot believe it': Australian man left speechless after making shock lost property discovery at Lifeline op shop,Preston Potts,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/arts-and-culture/i-just-cannot-believe-it-australian-man-left-speechless-after-making-shock-lost-property-discovery-at-lifeline-op-shop/news-story/e480284e39e3fd7617f7ae6ffaa3a8a9,"An Australian man shopping for a friend's new book has made a shock discovery, spotting framed pictures of himself and his wife they had lost 30 years ago.An Australian man was going by his day when he went to have a look at his friend, John Brogden's new book, until he made the wild discovery of framed pictures of himself and his wife they had lost 30 years ago.
An Australian man was going by his day when he went to have a look at his friend, John Brogden's new book, until he made the wild discovery of framed pictures of himself and his wife they had lost 30 years ago.
Rob Klaric was in the Lifeline Mosman store on Sydney's north shore when he spotted the two pictures on the floor, saying the discovery left him with ""no words"".
Mr Klaric then took to Instagram, letting his followers know Lifeline is ""more than just a store"" after the miraculous find.
""One of the pics is of Leonie standing in the backyard of my late mother Vanda's family home and birthplace in Mussons in Northern Italy,"" he said.
""The other pic is me, standing in front of the leaning tower of Pisa taken when Leonie and I first travelled and backpacked together in Italy way back in 1988 before we then returned home to Australia and were married in 1989.""
The couple had hung the images on a wall for a few years before a removal company misplaced the frames in 1994 when they moved houses.
He had always wondered what happened to the sentimental pictures and could not explain the ""feelings and emotions"" of being reunited with them 30 years later.
""I'm still buzzing with this. I mean, what's the chances?"" Mr Klaric told 2GB's Ben Fordham.
""I've walked into a store and I see these pictures and I thought I was hallucinating.""

The CEO of The Property Expert International said his son is ironically in London at the moment and is travelling to Pisa, Italy this weekend, where the pictures of him and his wife were captured.
Mr Klaric walked out a happy man after purchasing the frames and had a feeling his late mother had something to do with the discovery.
""Safe to say I bought them and unfortunately Leonie my picture was more expensive then yours. It was $12 and hers was $8,"" he said.
""My beautiful old Italian mum, it's got her fingerprints all over it.
""Those pictures were right in the middle (of the shop) on the floor, you would have never seen it unless you walked through the store.
""I know mum is in heaven watching over us all and God has blessed us with this truly amazing gift today.""
Mr Klaric did not just walk out with the two sentimental frames, he also picked up his dear friend, John Brogden's new released mental health awareness book.
""Congratulations to the President of Lifeline Suicide Prevention Charity on the release of the magnificent Book 'Profiles in Hope' with all royalties from the sale of the Book going back to supporting Lifeline Australia,"" he said.",SKY News,music
Am I a Christmas Scrooge? My house guests should be charged $120-150 for December 25 lunch,Des Houghton,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/arts-and-culture/am-i-a-christmas-scrooge-my-house-guests-should-be-charged-120150-for-december-25-lunch/news-story/b79ca2155a4a6445bc5be3e4fa2613a4,"I am thinking of charging my friends and relatives a fee to attend my Christmas lunch this year.
Call me Mr Scrooge if you must, but I am sure you will agree that the user-pays model is fair in these times of high inflation and zero wage growth.
I envisage a pay-as-you-enter fee of $120-150 to cover the basics.
The entry price would entitle my guests to a plate with a slice of turkey and ham, a rectangle of dauphinoise potatoes, gravy, two or three brussels sprouts and a Christmas Caprese salad. I don’t want to appear greedy, so I will throw in the first beer or glass of wine for free.
I’m wondering if I should copy the restaurant practice of charging for extras. An extra slice of turkey, for example, would be $5. An extra slice of ham, $5, and so on.
I’m not sure of the legalities of selling alcohol.
However, I was contemplating $10 for a sparkling wine, $30 for a glass of champagne and, say, $25 for a decent red, perhaps a glass of Taylors superb Masterstroke Cabernet Shiraz 2018. (It’s $60, but on sale at Dan Murphy’s for much less.)
Generous to a fault, I would offer discounts for non-drinkers and vegetarians, but there would be a surcharge for pudding.
And if someone could not afford to pay I would not humiliate them publicly. It is the season of goodwill after all.
Perhaps they may be able to work off the debt by mowing my lawn or washing my car.",SKY News,music

The Triple J-sponsored event consists of local artists and international headliners with the festival held typically in regional areas.
On Friday, the news broke to beloved Groovin fans that the festival won't go ahead for 2025.
""Groovin the Moo won't be happening in 2025, while we work on finding the most sustainable model for Australia's most loved regional touring festival,"" the post read on the organisers social media accounts.
""We will really miss seeing the smiling faces of all our beloved Moo Crew – and that means YOU!""
Groovin the Moo didn't mention anything about a future festival for 2026 but asked its fans one important question.
""In the meantime, which artist would you like to see on a GTM lineup?""
Comments quickly filled up on the organiser's Instagram.
""It doesn’t matter who we want to see everyone has boycotted the event no artist wants to hitch their horse to dodgy festival organisers anymore hence the cancellation of much bigger more successful events. It’s a big learning curve about the way artists and treated and also being connected to a sinking ship like @triple_j couldn’t be healthy for attendance,"" one said.
""Just do a year on and year off in conjunction with splendor or something of similar size. That way, punters have different festivals to look forward too!"" another commented.

'Best fillet steaks I’ve ever eaten': Brisbane's Black Hide restaurant hailed 'as one of the best restaurants in the country' as the city gets a major revamp,Des Houghton,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/arts-and-culture/best-fillet-steaks-ive-ever-eaten-brisbanes-black-hide-restaurant-hailed-as-one-of-the-best-restaurants-in-the-country-as-the-city-gets-a-major-revamp/news-story/648b63df34ec1589395736b94b9ef068,"I’ve just feasted on some of the best fillet steaks I think I’ve ever eaten.
I did so at Black Hide Steak & Seafood by Gambaro, a fab new restaurant with knockout views of down Brisbane River and beyond.
Right now Black Hide in Brisbane is arguably one the best restaurants in the country.
It has all the panache of a Michelin Star restaurant in say London or New York - and food to match.
The stylish restaurant sits on Level 4 of the new $4.5 billion Queen’s Wharf residential, hotel, dining, entertainment and gambling precinct.
The project has revitalised the Brisbane CBD.
The restaurant’s decor features calming, creamy taupes that give a timeless air.
There are large tables and curved banquettes for added intimacy.
A fearsome grill blazing in the kitchen provides the necessary sizzle to set the taste buds alight.
The food is adventurous, but not ridiculously so, with the chefs allowing the flavours of the beef and seafood to do the talking.
The meat is from the Stanbroke Group which has 100,000 head of cattle on seven properties in Queensland.
Queens Wharf is the new centre of gravity for Brisbane.
It is where the beautiful people go to play.
A Sky Deck lookout on the 23rd floor has become a tourist magnet with visits by more than 600,000 people in seven weeks.
Travellers look across the river to South Bank and the Emporium, Brisbane’s finest hotel.
It, too, showcases culinary grandeur worthy of a European capital - and perhaps the best wine list in the country.
The hotel’s cavernous underground “Reserve Cellar” has an extraordinary collection of vintages from France, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Germany, Austria, US, New Zealand and Australia.
The Emporium is home to a new restaurant, FIRMA Italian, where chef Alba Rizzo draws on the cuisine of Lombardy, her homeland.
Her menu reflects Lombard signatures, such as risotto milanese, slow-cooked osso buco, pork agnolotti and soft polenta.
“The agnolotti and ossobuco are part of my heritage and I’m proud to share a piece of my homeland for diners to experience,” she said.
FIRMA offers regional Italian wines from Piedmont and Tuscan not available elsewhere in Australia.
Another new restaurant called Stilts is on the way.
It is under construction on top of the new Kangaroo Point bridge.
Stilts will have 130 seats with commanding views of the river, the Story Bridge, City Botanic Gardens and the Kangaroo Point cliffs.
A café with 60 seats to be known as Mulga Bills will open soon on the CBD Plaza side of the bridge.
The new bridge also provides easier access to Brisbane’s best old pub.
The Story Bridge Hotel at 200 Main Street, Kangaroo Point was built in 1886.
It is an historic gem.
As well as beer gardens and bars offering Asian street food, pizza and burgers, the pub has an upscale restaurant, Deery’s, named after the family that owns it.
There are 15 different steak options, some under $50.
Iron woman Gina Rinehart's mouthwatering 2GR wagyu sirloin ($80) is at the top end.
Another Brisbane tourist magnet is the James Street shopping and restaurant precinct in Fortitude Valley. It overflows with eateries and fancy fashion boutiques.
The five-star Calile Hotel at 48 James Street sets the tone.
It has three of Brizzie’s better restaurants. Hellenika on the pool deck level is the city’s best Greek restaurant while SK Steak & Oyster on the ground level offers high-end beef and seafood.
SK offers Stockyard beef including high marble score wagyu to angus, as well as dry-aged options.
A menu highlight is Stockyard’s the internationally famous Kiwami sirloin ($220 for 400g, $110 for 200g) with a marble score at 9+. This beef is derived from cattle with Japanese wagyu genetics.
The Calile Hotel is also home to Sushi Room, perhaps Brisbane’s top Japanese restaurant.
And when the time comes to walk it off, Brisbane is blessed with accessible walking trails.
The city has two botanical gardens, one in the CBD near Parliament House and the other at Mt Coot-tha in the city’s west.
My favourite walk is from the Queensland Art Gallery past the performing arts centre to South Bank parklands.
South Bank is a 17ha green zone with riverfront parks that attracts 14 million people each year, including gallery and theatre patrons. It has its own man-made swimming lagoon and a sandy beach.
Not far away is the Grand Arbour, a 1km serpentine sculpture of metal tendrils soaring 10 metres high.
Quintessentially Brisbane, it provides a shady walkway beneath a canopy of glorious purple bougainvillea.",SKY News,music
Children's worldwide animated sensation Bluey to make the jump from TV to the big screen in 2027,Sumaiya Chowdhure,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/arts-and-culture/childrens-worldwide-animated-sensation-bluey-to-make-the-jump-from-tv-to-the-big-screen-in-2027/news-story/49302370d46bb95a09cc6a804af3ee02,"Children's hit TV show Bluey is set to hit the big screen with the series confirmed to be adapted into a full- length animated feature film.
BBC Studios and The Walt Disney Company announced overnight the Australian-made animated series will be released in cinemas in 2027.
The exciting new film will be made in Queensland, where the show was created and will be supported by the Crisafulli Government through Screen Queensland’s Post, Digital and Visual Effects (PDV) Incentive.
Bluey’s creator, Joe Brumm said he ""always thought Bluey deserved a theatrical movie"".
“I want this to be an experiential event for the whole family to enjoy together”.
Brumm is expected to write and direct the feature film which is a Ludo Studio production in collaboration with BBC Studios, and Disney will release it in cinemas to a worldwide audience.
The ultimate children's comfort show follows the exciting adventures of a cheery six-year-old Blue Heeler puppy who is learning all about the world with her sister and parents.
The film will star the voice actors from the show, including Melanie Zanetti and David McCormack as Bluey’s mum and dad, Chilli and Bandit Heeler, with music to be created by Bluey composer Joff Bush.
Bluey was originally created by Ludo Studio, based in Brisbane and after its initial release in Australia in 2018, the show captured the hearts of Aussie families almost instantly.
Not long after its national fame, Bluey became a global phenomenon for children around the world too and in 2022 it became one of the ten most streamed programs in the United States.
The show went on to be licensed abroad by BBC Studios and broadcast by Disney+ on which it was the most-watched series in 2024.
Minister for Arts John-Paul Langbroek said the movie would present Queensland’s incredible lifestyle and culture to the world.
“Bluey is a global household name, and we are thrilled to back one of Queensland’s favourite ambassadors on her first adventure to the big screen” Minister Langbroek said.
“Hot on the heels of the opening of Bluey’s World in Brisbane, where fans young and old can experience the Heeler family’s home for real life, this new feature film continues the Bluey series’ tradition of showcasing Queensland’s quintessential lifestyle, culture and environments.
“The movie – just like Bluey herself – will be a 100 per cent Queensland production and Ludo Studios’ talented writers, artists, cast and crew will continue their incredible work bringing these characters to life and capturing hearts across the globe.
“We know this movie will build on the international successes of Boy Swallows Universe and Black Snow to showcase our region globally, while creating local jobs and boosting our economy.”",SKY News,music

‘Snow Woke and the Seven Pronouns': Snow White remake panned as ‘potentially Disney’s biggest flop’,Patrick Hannaford,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/arts-and-culture/snow-woke-and-the-seven-pronouns-snow-white-remake-panned-as-potentially-disneys-biggest-flop/news-story/12511758e3636ae6766b55ceb6e044ed,"The latest live action remake of Snow White has been panned as “potentially Disney’s biggest flop”, with the movie studio attempting to limit the damage by scaling back marketing for the film.
The $300 million film was released on Thursday and has been beset by years of controversy since lead actor Rachel Zegler signalled the woke approach the film would take by panning the original Disney cartoon – which is itself a retelling of a German folk story first written down by the Brother's Grimm in 1812.
“The original cartoon came out in 1937 and very evidently so,” Zegler said in 2023.
“There is a big focus on her love story with a guy who literally stalks her - weird, weird! So we didn't do that this time.
Standing alongside Israeli co-star Gal Gadot – who she has since feuded with online over the war in Gaza – the 23-year-old Zegler explained that the Snow White she played would not be “dreaming about true love”.
“She’s not going to be saved by the prince, and she’s not going to be dreaming about true love. She’s dreaming about the leader that she knows she can be and the leader that her late father told her that she could be if she was fearless, fair, brave, and true,” the actor said.
The comments sparked an anti-woke backlash, which only increased when Disney revealed they wanted to ""avoid reinforcing stereotypes from the original animated film” and would be “taking a different approach” to the characters of the seven dwarfs.
While the seven do make an appearance in the movie – as computer-generated characters – the word ""dwarf"" does not.

Viewers are also advised not to laugh at Sleepy, because narcolepsy is a chronic neurological disorder, and that Dopey’s name “doesn’t mean he’s a dope!”.
Reviewers have largely panned the film, with London Times film critic Kevin Maher telling readers: “Believe the anti-hype. It’s bad”.
Speaking to Sky News Australia on Friday, commentator Evelyn Rae told Andrew Bolt: “Hopefully this flops so hard that (Disney) finally learn their lesson”.
“All I can say, Andrew, is that she'll be very thankful that there wasn't a prince to wake her up so that she can see all the reviews about the movie that she's been in,” Ms Rae said.
“They're actually saying that this is… potentially Disney's biggest flop.""
Sky News host James Macpherson was equally scathing, stating that “woke is a poison apple and Disney have had a big bite of it”.
“This movie should be called Snow Woke and the Seven Pronouns. It's so bad, if you were to watch this movie on an aeroplane, you'd walk out,” he joked.
Ms Rae noted that having such a massive failure could lead Disney to abandon the politically correct worldview it has embraced.
“We've just heard that for the first time in two decades, there's a new Disney Pixar animated series out there where they've put an openly Christian character in the series and they've replaced it, or they've actually cut out of that same series a transgender plot line,” she said.
“So I wonder whether it took Disney to hit rock bottom, to lose potentially $300 million, for them to bring back what every parent across the world wants, which is child-friendly, Christian value, good entertainment.""
It was revealed last week that Disney had massively scaled back its marketing of Snow White, including by cancelling the film's London premiere and ""minimising the amount of press questions that Rachel Zegler gets"".",SKY News,music
Business community issues renewed calls for 24-hour public transport amid drive to boost Sydney nightlife,Adriana Mageros,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/arts-and-culture/business-community-issues-renewed-calls-for-24hour-public-transport-amid-drive-to-boost-sydney-nightlife/news-story/b9b386582f9010587978f8945aae02a0,"The business community has led fresh calls for 24-hour public transport amid a drive to boost Sydney's nightlife scene.
City of Sydney Council has released plans in recent months to revitalise the CBD, which would allow bars, clubs, restaurants and pubs to have extended trade in 24-hour Special Entertainment Precincts.
Some venues and retailers could apply to open all day and night in the entertainment hubs, which are part of the New South Wales government's vibrancy reforms.
The initiative is estimated to rake in an extra $1 billion into the economy per year in what would be a much-needed spending surge after a tough few years for the hospitality industry, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The proposed late-night trading precincts encompass areas such as Central Station to The Rocks, including Haymarket, as well as parts of Oxford Street, Surry Hills and Kings Cross.
Speaking to SkyNews.com.au about the nightlife push, Avenue Group Sydney owner Philip Barbaro said the proposal was a positive step forward for harbour city.
However, he warned more needed to be done to bring the initiative to life, noting the impact on Sydney's nightlife following the introduction of the controversial lockout laws in the CBD and Kings Cross.
""It’s a step in the right direction, but damage has been done,"" Mr Barbaro said.
""By doing the lockout laws… we have lost a whole generation, probably two generations, of coming to the city to get to the entertainment precinct.""
Mr Barbaro has worked in hospitality for 19 years and owns seven businesses across Sydney including buzzing CBD cafes Avenue on Chifley, Avenue on George and Avenue on Sussex, as well as Southern Italy-inspired dining spot Bourke and Ward on Pitt Street and Alleyway bar on George Street.
The Monday to Friday venues open from morning until late, transforming throughout the day from cafes to bistro lunches, to night-time happy hours and live music on certain days.
Mr Barbaro argued 24-hour public transport services, particularly trains and metro lines, is essential to ensure Sydneysiders can travel to and from entertainment precincts during late-night trade.
He said extended rail services would also help hospitality staff get home from the CBD if they are working until early hours of the morning.
""I mean when I used to go out back in my heyday, we used to carpool,"" Mr Barbaro said.
""For these young ones to carpool they need to take out a mortgage to park in these carparks because we’re building these big buildings and everything else around the city, but we don’t have the carparks to support them.
""Or the existing carparks are price gouges because they don’t have the competition they used to.""
Mr Barbaro argued cost of living pressures have also forced many people to move further out of inner-city areas, leaving rideshare or taxis the only options for some commuters - which can be pricey.
""So it’s not just the trains, and the taxis and the buses, it’s also more than that,"" he said.
The renewed calls for increased public transport services come just weeks after Sydneysiders braced for a train shutdown due to industrial action by the Rail, Tram and Bus Union (RTBU).
The union had demanded a pay rise in addition to a 24-hour train roster from Thursday to Sunday, which it claimed would benefit commuters.
After multiple rounds of crisis talks with the union, the state government agreed to another weekend trial of limited 24-hour train services.
NSW Premier Chris Minns said at the time ""intensive bargaining"" would conducted with the RTBU over the coming weeks to secure a ""long-term deal"".
Chaos continued to engulf the network this week with separate protected industrial action impacting the maintenance of infrastructure at Redfern.
Currently, the metro line from Sydneyham to Tallawong runs until 1.22am from Monday to Thursday, 2.22am on Friday and Saturday, and just before midnight on Sunday. The service then restarts at 4.54am.
Meanwhile, the last trains out of the city generally stop about midnight, with NightRide buses replacing the services overnight until 4.30am.
The NSW government recently announced 24/7 bus routes on Fridays and Saturdays to Inner West Council areas, such as Balmain Darling Street, which is set to become a Special Entertainment Precinct.
The last ferry services also typically leave between midnight and 1am.
Business Sydney Executive Director Paul Nicolaou said 24-hour nightlife would pump and additional $1 billion into the economy per year.
""Sydney is firstly an international city. It’s a global city. It’s a city that shouldn't sleep beyond nine o’clock. It needs to be pumping 24/7,"" Mr Nicolaou told SkyNews.com.au.
""Prior to COVID and prior to the lockouts, Sydney was a happening place.
""We had King’s Cross, we had Newtown, we had certain precincts in Circular Quay and surrounding areas where the nightlife was going on full-on.
""But since COVID, since lockout laws, Sydney hasn’t fully recovered.""
Business Sydney data forecasts just a 20 per cent increase in Sydney's night-time economy could create 7,000 jobs.
Mr Nicolaou echoed calls for more public transport infrastructure, particularly metro, train and light rail services, running 24-hours during peak periods on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays.
""Until we change the transport options, and making it more accessible after 1am… people aren’t going to stay out because they can’t afford to stay out because they can’t afford taxis, they can’t afford Ubers,"" Mr Nicolaou said.
""You've got to probe that night-time transport option so people can stay longer, and hospitality staff can stay longer and work those extra hours, knowing full well they’ve got a transport option available to them to get home.
""A lot of people who work in hospitality come from outer regions of Sydney, so they might come from Gosford way, they might come from down south, they might come from out west, so therefore they need to have some option available to them to get home.""
Mr Nicolaou credited the Sydney of City Council and state government for the Special Entertainment Precinct initiative and scaling back ""all the red tape that small, medium sized businesses have to go through to keep the doors open"".
""When you’ve got a collaboration between government, business and council you’ll see that Sydney will start pumping,"" the Business Sydney Executive Director said.
Mr Nicolaou said the plans would help bring Sydney in line with other major international cities, but greater foot traffic into the city was essential for the initiative to succeed.
""The problem we’ve got here is two factors, one is the lack of public transport beyond 1am and number two we don’t have the population,"" he said.
""If you go to New York, or you go to London, there’s over a million people that live in the CBD or surrounding areas.
""Our population is very small compared to those countries. Sydney is a big city but if we’re serious about making the CBD and surrounding areas 24/7 we need to have people in… we need more foot traffic.""
In a statement to SkyNews.com.au, NSW 24-Hour Economy Commissioner Michael Rodrigues said the government would explore the possibility of increased public transport services.
""We know that reliable and affordable public transport and well-managed taxis and rideshare is a big consideration when it comes to going out behaviour,"" Mr Rodrigues said.
""We will continue to work with our colleagues at Transport for NSW and across government to deliver as many services as possible for the benefit of precincts and communities.""
Mr Rodrigues highlighted the state government's first rounds of vibrancy reforms, which aim to help live music and events thrive by knocking down harsh restrictions on Sydney venues.
Other changes have included dropping restrictions on outdoor dining approvals that prevented patrons from standing while drinking outside a licenced premises, and ending single noise complaints from shutting down pubs and other venues.
The reforms also require property buyers to be notified if they are moving into an entertainment zone in a bid to ease tensions between venues and neighbouring residents.
""The later trade and different noise rules in a SEP (Special Entertainment Precinct) mean entertainment and businesses can thrive with certainty,"" Mr Rodrigues said.
""Councils can future-proof new precincts or grow their local going-out districts, whether they are restaurant ‘eat streets’, live music destinations, tourist or cultural hubs.""
Mr Rodrigues said more than 20 councils across NSW have expressed interest in establishing a Special Entertainment Precinct, ten of which have passed resolutions to investigate the creation of the hubs in their local areas.
""Three of these councils have also resolved to establish SEPs in specific locations: Inner West, Burwood and Sutherland Shire councils,"" he said.
In 2023, Enmore Road in Sydney's Inner West was named the state's first permanent Special Entertainment Precinct after a two-year trial.
Sydney Lord Mayor Clover Moore has also previously voiced support for non-stop public transport services.
""I would also like to see the state government offer improved late night public transport, including a 24/7 metro,"" Ms Moore said in a council statement in October.
""This would not only help people to get around the city and enjoy all it has to offer, it would help hospitality workers, many of whom are young women, feel more comfortable in working a late shift and getting home safely.""
The consultation process is now open for the community to submit feedback on the Special Entertainment Precinct plans, and proposed changes to sound and trading hours on the City of Sydney Council's website.",SKY News,music
Paul Murray holds back tears during emotional tribute for former colleague and beloved media personality Clive Robertson,Sumaiya Chowdhure,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/arts-and-culture/paul-murray-holds-back-tears-during-emotional-tribute-for-former-colleague-and-beloved-media-personality-clive-robertson/news-story/c76d257efe28515a3dc9d082974b88f2,"Sky News host Paul Murray has fought back tears as he delivered an emotional tribute for the late Clive Robertson who he remembered as a ""titanic figure of Australian broadcasting"".
Robertson's death at the age of 78 was announced on Thursday by his former network Seven after he privately battled cancer for a year.
The iconic broadcaster was best known for hosting Newsworld and chat show Beauty and the Beast in a revolutionary media career beginning in the 1970s.
Murray recalled growing up watching Robertson on Newsworld, describing how he was particularly fond of the broadcaster's ""beautiful"" and ""incredible"" news reading voice.
""We grew up watching this late night show and it was called Newsworld, and it was on roughly about 10.30pm on Channel Seven,"" Murray said.
""And it was Clive reading the news and Clive had read the news before on the 11am program.
""But this was a newscast where he would read the news perfectly with that beautiful, incredible voice, but he'd start mucking around because that's Clive.""
With a unique and quirky approach to broadcasting, Robertson was known for changing the face of media by being a frequent rule-breaker and often diverting from the script.
But it was this expressive style of news reading which was the first of its kind to win Robertson high star ratings and listeners from all around tuning in for his various musings.
""He can't not muck around. He can't not poke fun. And then that became the attraction,"" Murray said.
""There's all stuff about the Berlin Wall falling and nuclear arms race and then there'll be a silly story about dolphins. All of those sorts of things.
""But this wickedly funny, smart man who the more you watched him, the more you loved him.""
Robertson was just two weeks away from his 79th birthday before his passing.
His wife Heidi and close friend Jason were by his bedside at the time of his death.
Close friends Kel Richards and Jason Morrison also joined Murray on the show to reminisce on their time working together in radio and the laughter Robertson bought to their lives.
The high-rating radio star first joined the ABC breakfast show in 1972, working on the station 2BL and also presenting the 7pm news for the broadcaster, before moving to the Seven network in the 1980s.
Murray told viewers he first met Robertson at the beginning of his journalistic career working at the 2GB where the pair bonded.
""I have said many a time as a high functioning dyslexic, which means when you come up against a person as brilliant as Clive and you put words in the wrong place, he points them out,"" Murray said.
""And then there'd be a little test about whether you could take it and. Clearly he liked that I could. And then we became friends.
""I was lucky enough to be one of the very few people in his life for a nice chunk of time.""
Murry went on to say Robertson ""rocked"".
""And one of the things whenever you do a job like this is that you're most afraid of when you don't do a job like this is that one day you'll just be forgotten. It is my mission tonight to make sure that he is not forgotten and that we celebrate,"" he said.",SKY News,music
James Halliday editor Campbell Mattinson names Lake Breeze Wines Moscato 2023 as his bargain buy for Christmas shoppers,Des Houghton,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/arts-and-culture/james-halliday-editor-campbell-mattinson-names-lake-breeze-wines-moscato-2023-as-his-bargain-buy-for-christmas-shoppers/news-story/b506556f536a166e12175225aa26d632,"A leading wine guy has recommended a $20 sweet sparkling wine as a bargain buy for the Christmas holidays.
Campbell Mattinson, chief editor of the James Halliday Wine Companion recommended Lake Breeze Wines Moscato 2023 from South Australia.
“It's grapey and floral and typical - it tastes like just about every other moscato - but it has an extra lick of intensity, and it makes a positive difference. Buy this one,” he said.
Mattinson’s Christmas special was made from white frontignac grapes from 50-year-old Langhorne Creek vines, said winemaker Greg Follett, 54.
Follett said he picked the fruit early to retain natural acidity as a foil to the grapey sweetness of the variety that is native to the Piedmont in northwest Italy.
Just in time for Christmas a brother and sister team from one of Australia’s most prominent wine dynasties have released three new sparkling wines under their Corryton Burge label.
Trent and Amelia Burge are sixth-generation Barossans and the children of Grant Burge, the force behind some of Australia’s iconic reds that still bear his name.
Grant Burge and his wife Helen sold their business to Accolade in 2015, but the family still has two wineries in the Barossa and 400ha under vine in the Barossa Valley, Eden Valley, Adelaide Hills and Tasmania.
The Corryton Burge sparkling collection includes a NV pinot chardonnay ($28) a NV sparkling red ($28) and a more highbrow and refined Corryton Burge 2019 Martha Mae Tasmanian Sparkling Pinot Noir Chardonnay ($45).
The name was inspired by Corryton House, an historic 150-year-old stone building on Corryton Park homestead in the Eden Valley. Trent Burge refers to it as “our Aussie chalet”.
The father-of-two said the sparkling red was a blend of cabernet sauvignon, shiraz, and grenache.
It delivers dark berries with dark chocolate and espresso flavours with aromas of cooking spices and a hint of vanilla.
“It’s the first thing we start with on Christmas morning, that’s for sure,” Burge said.
Best’s Wines from Great Western in Victoria has released a white cuvée made entirely from shiraz grapes.
Best’s Wines 2024 Blanc de Noir ($30) was made by fifth generation winemaker, Ben Thomson.
He also made Best’s Wines 2020 Sparkling Shiraz ($35), a Christmas day favourite in Australia because of its mouthwatering compatibility with Christmas tucker like turkey, ham and pork.
The district has a distinguished history with sparkling shiraz.
Seppelt Show Sparkling Limited Release Shiraz 2012 ($100) from the Grampians in Victoria is a showstopper.
Critic Tyson Stelzer gave it 97 points and named it his sparkling red wine of the year.
Sparkling Shiraz is an Australian creation. It was first produced in the 1890s by champenoise winemaker Charles Pierlot.
Connoisseurs of vintage champagne will no doubt be combing the results of the recent Champagne and Sparkling Wine World Championships.
More than 1000 prestige cuvées were judged.
The supreme world champion trophy went to Dom Ruinart 2007 Blanc de Blancs ($500).
It is from the oldest champagne house of all. It was founded by Nicolas Ruinart in 1729, more than four decades before Captain Cook arrived in Australia.
Dom Ruinart 2007 Rosé ($475) also won a trophy with Charles Heidsieck NV Rosé Réserve ($145) named the best classical rose brut in the world.
The trophy for the world champion classic vintage brut blend was awarded to Palmer & Co 2015 Grands Terroirs En Magnum ($1000+) while Dom Pérignon 2002 P2 ($1000+) was named world champion “library vintage”.
Back in the real world, French producer Château Miraval has released a new rose called STUDIO, ($27) a feisty blend of cinsault, grenache, vermentino and tibouren.
It’s billed as a holiday drink for celebrities that will transport you to the Côte d'Azur.

It was in fact unfermented riesling juice his famous father would bring home from the winery in a jug and put in the fridge.
For Sam and his two sisters the juice was a treat, and the deliveries became a family ritual.
“We grew up in a house surrounded by grapevines,” he said.
He recalls jumping in puddles fed by the irrigation drippers.
“When the riesling grapes came in they were pressed and had sulphur and an enzyme added to take all the solids out,” Mr Wigan said.
“Dad would wait until the juice was nice and clarified - really clear. It was lovely and bright with a straw and lemon colour.
“It had good acidity and was really aromatic so as kids we would have a nice, fresh, clean riesling juice to drink.
“I’ll never forget that.”
Sam and his sisters lapped it up.
It had zero alcohol, of course, because the juice was not fermented.
Sam’s dad Andrew who was the chief winemaker at Peter Lehmann Wines for 35 years was a towering figure in the wine world.
He made outstanding wines across a number of varieties, especially shiraz, riesling and grenache.
He crafted treasures like The Stonewell shiraz which still holds its place among the top-tier Barossa reds.
Peter Lehmann Masters Wigan Riesling crafted in his honour has been named Best Riesling in the World at the International Wine and Spirit Competition.
Son Sam is the now chief winemaker at Hill-Smith Family Estates which has released four lighter style wines in its new Y Series range.
“Lighter” is code for lower alcohol.
Hill-Smith wines include household names like Yalumba, Australia’s oldest family-owned winery which celebrated its 175th anniversary in November last year.
Other labels in the Hill Smith portfolio include Jansz, Dalrymple, Pewsey Vale, Heggies Vineyard, Running with the Bulls and Oxford Landing.
I’m told the Y Series Lighter is transitioning to a stand-alone brand.
Indeed.
The name Yalumba is written in a smaller typeface on some labels and does not appear at all on others.
There is a lighter sparkling cuvée, a lighter shiraz, a lighter chardonnay and a lighter pinot gris.
Lighter on the wallet too, with a price tag of $15-16.
But they are not lighter on personality.
The wines are unoaked, vegan friendly and 100 percent wild fermented, said Wigan, a father of two whose wife Siobhan is also a winemaker.
“Creating wines with a lighter touch allows the natural variety of the wine to sing,” he said.
“Our philosophy with the Y series is that they embody their varieties: if you pick up a shiraz it should taste like a shiraz.
“It is the same for the pinot noir or the pinot gris. They should taste of the grape.
“We have been working hard to craft lighter wines that still have great balance.”
Mission accomplished Mr Wigan as these are very appealing quaffers.
I didn’t have a sense that I was missing out on much by having the lighter alternative.
The percentage of alcohol in the Y Series Lighter varies slightly.
The Y Series Lighter Shiraz, for instance, has eight percent ABV, or alcohol by volume.
By comparison, Yalumba’s esteemed cabernet-shiraz blend, ‘The Signature’, usually has between 13.5 to 14.5 ABV.
The Y Series Pinot Noir is a solid offering for the price. However, it didn’t earn itself the lighter tag.
It has 15.5 percent ABV.
It’s an aromatic, fruit-driven uncomplicated pinot with juicy strawberries and a spicy background.
And there is a newcomer to the Y Series range. It’s a prosecco (10.5 percent ABV).

Darwin mother recalls how her toddler escaped Cyclone Tracy with a 'luggage tag around her leg' after a neighbour's house crashed into their home,Matt Cunningham,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/arts-and-culture/darwin-mother-recalls-how-her-toddler-escaped-cyclone-tracy-with-a-luggage-tag-around-her-leg-after-a-neighbours-house-crashed-into-their-home/news-story/9819a39dc90682b0e8019e0383c6dbe3,"The luggage tag strapped around her ankle was all that identified two-year-old Brenda Brocker when she arrived at Brisbane airport.
She had been rushed on to a Hercules aircraft and evacuated from the ruins of Darwin after Cyclone Tracy had flattened the city on Christmas Day, 1974.
Brenda’s mother, Freda, had been seriously injured when her neighbour’s house was picked up by Tracy and crashed into her home.
“It smashed the toilet, maybe that’s what did my leg, I don’t know, but I had Brenda I was nursing her and she was thrown into the mattress there and I just ran, I got under another mattress but I panicked of course, then I ran out and (my husband) Nick had picked up Brenda, a screaming child, wondering what was happening, and I ran out and I fell in the mud,” Freda said.
“We got into one car and then the windscreen went in that car so we got in the other one, there I was down on the floor with Brenda and Nick and then I discovered that my leg was badly cut so he tore my dress and put a tourniquet on it, tied a piece of my dress around my leg.”
The family spent the next five hours sheltering in that car as Tracy wiped out almost everything around them.
By the time the sun rose on Christmas Day, 66 people were dead and more than half of the city’s 47,000 residents were homeless.
Freda would be one of the first of the injured to be flown out of Darwin as authorities undertook the biggest peacetime evacuation in Australian history.
But even getting to the airport was a mission.
“The ambulance is going along, up and down, well it was a very rough trip because it was up and down gutters, everything I imagine, they had to move things out of the way,” Freda said.
As she was loaded into the Hercules, she presumed her daughter was staying behind with her husband.
Little did she know, two-year-old Brenda was on the same plane.
“(Nick) handed Brenda to the captain, Captain Charlie, of that plane.  I didn’t know she was on the plane, I had no idea,” she said.
“She’s got a tag around her leg, because, well, that’s the only way they would have known what her name was, because there was nothing else, so they put this luggage tag around her leg with her name on it and she was handed to the Salvation Army family, to Beula Harris at the time was her name.”
Freda’s story is one of many recounted as part of a special Sky News documentary, Cyclone Tracy: 50 Years On, which premieres on Wednesday night.
Antony Bullock, who was 12 years old when Tracy hit, has recalled watching his home in Darwin’s northern suburbs being blown away before his eyes.
His father had ordered the family downstairs to shelter in the toilet.
“Unbeknownst to me that downstairs toilet was locked because I had brand new push bike in there,” he said.
“Dad goes ‘the key, you’ve got to get the key to downstairs', so I had to go back into the kitchen and this is pitch black, the house is shaking.
“As I grabbed it, I turned around and that bottom end of the kitchen just exploded out, just disappeared and all I could see was the flash of lightning and just bits of debris going everywhere.”
He remembers his father grabbing his hand as they tried to rush down the outdoor staircase.
“As we took one step, we just disappeared,” he said.
“Something just picked us up off the stairs and before we knew it we were on the lawn, 5 to 10 metres away from the veranda.”
Tracy destroyed about 80 per cent of Darwin’s houses.
It also cut off most of the city’s critical infrastructure, making it almost impossible for people from interstate to contact loved ones and check if they were OK.
Alan Haines had been at midnight mass with his sister when Tracy struck.
They survived the night in the nurses’ quarters at the Darwin hospital.  But it would be more than a week before their mother in Adelaide knew they were alive.
“She’d actually written a letter to us,” he said.
“I don’t have it anymore, but it was a mother’s plea to her children, ‘please God we’ll all be OK’, and we were.”

"Tasmanian winemaker Ed Carr releases House of Arras gold-medal winning bubbles just in time for Christmas, as he celebrates historic award",Des Houghton,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/arts-and-culture/tasmanian-winemaker-ed-carr-releases-house-of-arras-goldmedal-winning-bubbles-just-in-time-for-christmas-as-he-celebrates-historic-award/news-story/ad01b9a161a57252111248691fa7da2f,"Ed Carr is the Father Christmas of the Australian sparkling wine industry.
The British-born winemaker adds sparkle to the festive season, releasing a set of gold-medal winning bubbles from Tasmanian grapes under the House of Arras label.
They range in price from House of Arras Brut Elite NV Cuvée 1801 ($68) to his Christmas cracker - the House of Arras E.J Carr Late Disgorged 2006 ($277) - that recently won the chairman’s trophy at the Champagne and Sparkling Wine World Championships in London.
In Western Australia, Mr Car’s protégé Nic Bowen from Howard Park Wines has challenged his master by releasing three sparkling wines in the family wine company’s Jeté range.
Mr Bowen trained under Mr Carr for a dozen years before he joined Howard Park, a five-star winery run by the wonderful Burch family who dared to push the boundaries as pioneers in WA.
The Jeté range honours David Burch, now in semi-retirement, who was a principal dancer with the Australian Ballet from 1977 to 1983, performing more than 50 roles in a dozen different ballets.
All balletomanes know that the Jeté in ballet is the demanding grand leap.
Mr Bowen’s Jeté bubbles show refinement and complexity.
The Jeté bubbles were crafted from fruit grown in the family’s prized Mount Barrow vineyard in the Mount Barker sub-region of Western Australia’s Great Southern.
It is a region that enjoys cooling ocean breezes.
Leading the charge is the delightful Grand Jeté 2019 ($58) followed by the Jeté Brut ($44), a Petit Jeté Blanc de Blancs ($33) and a Jeté Rosé ($48).
The Grand Jeté is made from Chardonnay and Pinot Noir and radiates citrus, white stone fruit and mixed berries notes.
Aromas of shortbread and apple tart emerge alongside an oyster shell minerality with flavours of white grapefruit, lemon pith, finger limes and green apple mingle seamlessly.
Mr Bowen's tasting notes say the almond and gingersnap notes arrived courtesy of 52 months spent on lees in tirage.
“Our 2019 Grand Jeté release reflects a vintage that was primed to produce concentrated fruit,” Mr Bowen said.
“Chardonnay was the star of the show, especially the I10V1 clone with its classical ripe lemon flesh core, which made up 75 per cent of the blend, the rest being 777 clone Pinot Noir.
“The wine is displaying classic chardonnay development with nutty, brioche and citrus aromatics. These flavours are further complexed by the Pinot Noir’s cut apple, chalky structure and truffle tones.’’
Mr Carr finishes his year splendidly after earning the title of Sparkling Winemaker of the Year at the International Wine Challenge.
Mr Carr said he was honoured to be the first Australian winemaker to be crowned with the title.
It was only the second time in the competition's 40-year history that a winemaker outside of Champagne took the award.
Mr Carr’s efforts have put Tasmania on the world sparkling wine map.
A major breakthrough for him came when prestigious Decanter Magazine bypassed a vintage Krug to name his 2004 House of Arras E.J. Carr Late Disgorged sparkling the 2020 sparkling wine of the year.
Howard Park, meanwhile, continues its research and experimentation with pinot clones while making appealing French-style chardonnay, oaked and unoaked.
A nexus between Jeff Burch and French pinot master Pascal Marchand they met in the cellars of Domaine Comte Armand in Pommard led to the creation of the Marchand & Burch label in 2007.
The so-called village wines in this range are “exuberant, varietal and ready to drink” Mr Burch said.
Try Marchand & Burch Village Chardonnay 2023 ($48) and Marchand & Burch Village Pinot Noir 2023 ($48).
Mr Burch said the Mount Barker Chardonnay was envisioned as a tribute to Chassagne-Montrachet, while the Villages chardonnay offers a nod to a Chablis style.
The pinot shows dark berry fruit flavours and is recommended to be served with duck.",SKY News,music
Dictionary.com chooses 'demure' as its word of the year after viral TikToker's popularisation of 'very mindful' phrase,Sumaiya Chowdhure,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/arts-and-culture/dictionarycom-chooses-demure-as-its-word-of-the-year-after-viral-tiktokers-popularisation-of-very-mindful-phrase/news-story/e8becc932acc601a7733d5c9b6fd3532,"Dictionary.com has chosen ""demure"" as its word of the year, attributing the term's spike in popularity to American TikToker and beauty influencer Jools Lebron after the phrase ""very demure, very mindful"" gained popularity in early August.
In an announcement released on Monday, Dictionary.com said the word of the year served as a ""linguistic time capsule"", reflecting social trends and global events of the year.
""The Word of the Year isn’t just about popular usage; it reveals the stories we tell about ourselves and how we’ve changed over the year. And for these reasons, Dictionary.com’s 2024 Word of the Year is demure,"" the announcement read.
The term demure has been used to describe a person who is reserved, quiet or modest.
It experienced a ""meteoric rise"" in 2024 when Lebron used the word in a viral video with the catchphrase, “You see how I do my makeup for work? Very demure. Very mindful”.
#fyp #demure
Lebron used demure to describe ""refined and sophisticated appearance or behaviour in various contexts, such as at work or on a plane"".
""This increased focus on public appearance and behaviour comes at a time when employees are increasingly returning to offices after hybrid remote work following the pandemic,"" the Dictionary.com statement said.
Thousands of TikTok users jumped on the ""demure trend"" almost overnight to create satire videos similar to that of Lebron's.
Popular celebrities and influencers also rapidly picked up on the term taking advantage of its marketing and promotive capabilities.
According to Dictionary.com, between August 2023 and July 2024, there was no significant trend in the usage of the word demure, however by the week of August 18, 2024, there was almost 14 times more interest in the term.
""Between January and the end of August, this term (demure) saw a nearly 1,200 per cent increase in usage in digital web media alone,"" Dictionary.com said.
To select the 2024 word of the year, Dictionary. com said lexicographers analysed a large amount of data including news headlines and trends on social media to identify words which made an impact on conversations, online and in the real world.
While demure topped the linguistics charts, a few other words were also on Dictionary.com's list including ""Brainrot"", ""Brat"", ""Extreme weather"", ""Midwest nice"" and ""Weird"".",SKY News,music

Sydney Trains announced it is set to run services for 46 hours continuously to ensure revellers have a safe and reliable journey to and from the CBD.
The bumper timetable will see 6,000 services operating between 4am Tuesday, December 31, to 2am Thursday, January 2.
Sydney Trains will have additional services running across most lines from 2pm on NYE, with regular services to run well after the midnight fireworks.
To avoid high levels of congestion throughout precincts, trains will not stop at Circular Quay from 3pm with services not opening its doors at Milsons Point after 6pm.
Sydney Trains Chief Executive Matt Longland said his team will be putting in the hours to maintain the million-plus crowd to make sure NYE runs smoothly this year.
""Approximately 3,600 Sydney Trains staff will work across the network on New Year’s Eve, to help the million-plus crowd expected to flood into the city’s vantage points have a safe and reliable public transport trip,"" Mr Longland said.
""The Rail Operations Centre is abuzz with activity this week, with around 120 people per shift working 24 hours a day.
""To ensure the most reliable and safe network possible, crews are busy working through a maintenance schedule in the lead up to New Year's Eve.
""We have built detailed crowd management plans for our stations and will have additional staff on the ground at key locations.""
Along with train services running at a high frequency, the Sydney Metro from Tallawong to Sydenham will be helping the bustling crowds for the first time this NYE.
There will be an additional 1,500 bus services running with extra late-night ferries operating as Sydney welcomes in the New Year.

"'Laid back, yet dynamic': Brisbane is the new capital of cool - even surpassing Sydney, Melbourne in terms of fine food",Des Houghton,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/arts-and-culture/laid-back-yet-dynamic-brisbane-is-the-new-capital-of-cool-even-surpassing-sydney-melbourne-in-terms-of-fine-food/news-story/4df845fc220cf48726a81892ee546bd5,"For decades Brisbane was a sweaty, unattractive sleepy hollow inhabited by archly conservative citizens who went to sleep at night serenaded by a chorus of cane toads.
No more.
The torpor has lifted.
Tourists are discovering what locals already know: “Brizzie” is Australia’s new capital of cool with cutting-edge art, fashion, food, music and - importantly - architecture.
Popular Brisbane Lord Mayor Adrian Schrinner struck a chord recently when he pointed out that a third of the city’s residents were born overseas. Metropolitan and cosmopolitan.
Last week he unveiled yet another spectacular footbridge, this one linking the CBD to Kangaroo Point, fulfilling a dream by civic leaders stretching back a century.
There was much celebration last year with the opening of another footbridge.
The Neville Bonner Bridge provides a direct link between the new Queen's Wharf precinct and Star casino and South Bank Parklands.
Brisbane has taken the best bits of Melbourne and Sydney and re-framed them to suit its own sub-tropical lifestyle, and in some cases improved them.
Brisbane remains a paradox.
It's laid back, yet dynamic.
Demographer Elin Charles-Edwards from the University of Queensland pointed out in a recent interview that Brisbane has grown twice as fast as Sydney or Melbourne in the last 50 years.
And while snooty southerners don’t see Brisbane as an equal to Sydney or Melbourne, its cultural and demographic growth suggests otherwise.
Is it any wonder that visitor numbers are soaring?
The South Bank cultural precinct is in full swing right now with a major international art exhibition that straddles the Queensland Art Gallery and its big brother, the Gallery of Modern Art.
Exclusive to Brisbane, the Asia Pacific Triennial of Contemporary Art featuring 70 artists and collectives from more than 30 countries.
With the Triennial series, Brisbane has become a gateway to the evolving artistic expression of Australia, Asia, the Pacific and beyond, including work by emerging artists not previously seen in Australia.
Near the galleries in the performing arts centre, the Queensland Symphony Orchestra is playing to packed houses since the appointment of the inspirational Umberto Clerici, an Italian cellist and conductor, to the position of chief conductor two years ago.
Brisbane is a hub for literature and journalism.
The city gave us the living treasure Trent Dalton, who waded into the human swamp of his boyhood to give us ‘Boy Swallowed Universe’.
Then came his mesmerising ‘Lola in the Mirror’.
Dalton polished his writing skills at The Courier-Mail, as did investigative journalist Hedley Thomas, now a serial podcaster at The Australian.
Pecking away on a keyboard near them was another prominent member of the Brisbane School, Matthew Condon, and near him Phil Brown, the beat poet and arts writer.
Courier-Mail journalists dutifully tracked Brisbane’s ascent from sleepy town to an exuberant city basking in a new sub-tropical magnificence.
Yet despite its cultural refinements Brisbane remains hip and gritty with a rowdy nightlife, an eclectic small bar scene, hole-in-the-wall wine shops and a vibrant food market precinct.
And I'll go out on a limb here and say some of Brisbane's restaurants would leave most of those in Sydney and Melbourne for dead.
Bridges criss-cross the river making it pedestrian and cyclist friendly.
The new $299 million Kangaroo Point bridge is 460m long and 95m from the water to the top of the mast.
“It’s clear people already love the Kangaroo Point Bridge with more than 250,000 people crossing the bridge to date,” Mr Schrinner said.
“There’s a real buzz about Brisbane at the moment with historic visitation records hit in the past 12 months with domestic visitor numbers climbing 14.3 percent delivering a record-smashing visitor spend of $7.9 billion.
“Residents and visitors love Brisbane because of our incredible lifestyle, vibrant precincts and fantastic sub-tropical climate.”
And there is more to come.
Mr Schrinner said he was looking forward to 2025 for the roll-out of a fully electric turn-up-and-go Metro bus rapid transit system.

The Jezabels distance themselves from singer Hayley Mary after she wore a MAGA hat in social media post,Patrick Staveley,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/arts-and-culture/the-jezabels-distance-themselves-from-singer-hayley-mary-after-she-wore-a-maga-hat-in-social-media-post/news-story/abebcc8035f71dcde4db66f6c1877871,"Aussie rock singer Hayley Mary has doubled down on her message despite her own band distancing itself from her over a social media post where she was wearing a MAGA hat.
The 37-year-old singer-songwriter and member of The Jezabels, who are currently on hiatus, shared the image after Donald Trump was re-elected by the American public in the 2024 US Presidential Election.
She said she led with the picture of herself in the hat for ""shock value"" to get the attention of her followers as she condemned Labor's misinformation bill in the extensive post.
The backlash Mary received has been damaging, resulting in her being ""cancelled"" as she lost support of some friends while her future in the music industry has become clouded by the controversy.
On Thursday, her fellow Jezabels bandmates distanced themselves from the singer in a statement posted to Instagram.
""From the start The Jezabels was a democratic quartet of disparate individuals. We were young uni students who brought inspiration to the rehearsal room from our studies, and our grievances with the status quo,"" the statement read.
""The Jezabels aspired to create moments of hope and beauty - music that might offer people some respite in facing their day-to-day challenges in this challenging world.""
The band said one of its most satisfying moments was hearing from queer fans in particular and how their music helped them during tough times.
The group stopped short of mentioning Mary's name as it condemned the ""language of the far-right"".
""We were, are still, and always will be inspired by those in the struggle, people who quietly and tirelessly work to improve the conditions of the less well-off, or those looking to assert their identity in response to prejudice,"" the statement said.
""We abhor the language of the far-right and see through their grotesque attempts to moralise on free speech.
""The struggle continues. With love and despair, but hope... Heather, Nik and Sam.""
Mary appeared on Sky News Australia's The Bolt Report on Thursday night, where she said she was doing ""quite well"" despite the fallout, as she expected the visceral reactions before sharing the post.
""It might look tough from the outside, but my cancellation process is quite unique in the sense I did it to myself on purpose to make multiple points,"" she told host Andrew Bolt.
""I was very aware of what was going to happen, I went through all the people I knew and how I thought they might react to it before I did it, and they have reacted exactly as I would suspect.
""But it's not as tough on me as I think it is on everyone else who's ever been cancelled, when they've done it accidentally to themselves.""
The singer said the angry reaction proved her point of wokeness in the music culture, which is part of the reason why she wore the MAGA hat in the first place.
She also said she had lost passion in ""the arts"" as she claimed it was difficult for musicians to be able to hold a different stance on particular issues.
""I think the wokeness has captured every part of our industry, to the point where you cannot have a different opinion,"" she said.
""There's a bad sort of, Orwellian (situation)... you're forced to defriend people if they have the wrong opinions, your family sometimes turn against you. That kind of stuff I think is really damaging to society and I wanted to break out of it, from an industry that's captured by it.""",SKY News,music
"Rare and massive corpse flower set to go on display in Sydney's CBD, releasing smell of 'wet teenage socks' and cat vomit",Sumaiya Chowdhure,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/arts-and-culture/rare-and-massive-corpse-flower-set-to-go-on-display-in-sydneys-cbd-releasing-smell-of-wet-teenage-socks-and-cat-vomit/news-story/785dccdcac8907a73aa04c751f67e7df,"The largest flower in the world found in the wild only in the rainforests of western Sumatra will bloom in Sydney's Royal Botanic Gardens (RBG) this weekend, releasing the pungent smell of rotting flesh.
The rare and endangered Corpse Flower is called Amorphophallus titanum and it is a parasitic plant which attaches to the wild grapes of the vine genus Tetrastigma, providing everything necessary for the flower to survive.
Each flower lives for just a few days before they wither and die, making it a rare sighting as only a few people get to see a fully developed Corpse Flower bloom.
Boasting the scent of ""wet teenage socks"" and ""cat vomit"", experts believe the Corpse Flower will bloom in the Royal Botanic Gardens at some point between Friday and Monday, however it is hard to predict the time it will happen.
""At the moment the spadix (the large pale spike in the centre of the plant) is growing fast,"" the RBG wrote in a statement.
""Once this growth spurt ends, the spathe (the crimson skirt that surrounds the spike) will start to open.
""That’s when the smell begins.""
The unforgettable smell of the flower serves an essential purpose to attract pollinators in the centre of its meaty pulp.
Carrion beetles and flies are attracted to this smell because they want to lay their eggs in a rotting animal corpse.
""The smell and colour of the flower trick them into visiting and the heat generated by the plant entices them to visit, breed and party,"" the RBG said.
The plant will be on display from 8am until midnight on bloom day and entries to watch the magnificent unveiling will be by donations.
There are several Corpse Flower plants in different stages of growth in the Aroid glasshouse of the nursery.
However, blooms are very rare, occurring for just 24 hours every few years. This will be the fifth time a Corpse Flower has bloomed at the Royal Botanic Garden Sydney.
Paul Nicholson, Manager of Volunteer Programs at the RBG said, “If you've got some wet teenage socks, throw that into a blender, then you get some cat food you've left out in the sun, whack that in your blender, and then get some day old vomit. Put that in the blender, blend it all up, rip the lid off"".
""That's the kind of smell you're getting.
""It’s actually stunningly beautiful as well.”

"As calls intensify for a royal commission into child care, senior politicians are reluctant to take action",ABy Adele Ferguson,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-19/childcare-royal-commission-anthony-albanese-anne-aly/105066706,"As the public outcry from educators and parents intensifies in the wake of Four Corners' investigation into Australia's broken childcare system, the reluctance of senior politicians responsible for overseeing the sector to do something to fix it is striking.
While the federal Greens have joined the growing calls for a royal commission into the system, the prime minister's response epitomised a serious flaw in the sector: a cycle of blame-shifting between state and federal governments instead of real action.
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese acknowledged the Four Corners revelations, calling them ""of deep concern,"" but when pressed on the issue, he handballed responsibility to the states.
""State governments look after the regulation,"" he said, adding ""I'm sure that state governments will have a look at what has been revealed [on Four Corners].""
Next came Albanese's swift rejection of the growing calls for a royal commission: ""People call for royal commissions whenever anything comes out immediately. They take years, they cost a lot of money. You do not need a royal commission to show that what was shown on TV last night was wrong.""
The moment Emily picked up her son from childcare, she knew something was wrong.
Anne Aly, the federal minister responsible for child care, came out on Tuesday afternoon and parroted similar talking points to Albanese's but added that she had asked the head of the quality standards for child care for ways to improve quality and safety in child care.
This is less than the Productivity Commission recommended in a report released more than six months ago, which recommended an independent review of the National Quality Framework to improve assessment and quality ratings of child care centres.
Under the current scheme, all childcare centres must be rated, but 10 per cent have never been rated. And those that have been rated, on average, have not been reassessed for four years. Some centres in South Australia have not been reassessed for up to nine years.
The report said the resources provided for regulators to carry out assessment and rating visits ""do not seem to be sufficient to allow for the current number of operating services to be assessed in a reasonable timeframe"".
In plain language, that means more funding is required to ensure the frequency of assessments is better than the current four-yearly average.
The Productivity Commission also recommended the establishment of an independent childcare commission.
For mothers like Emily, whose child was sexually abused at child care, the lack of interest in a royal commission or offering solutions to fix the system is disappointing.
""You can't be putting a price tag on children that can't speak up for themselves,"" she said.
""Money has got nothing to do with it. I'm sure everyone in Australia would be happy to put money towards a royal commission to help protect them.""
Emily, whose identity is anonymised for legal reasons to protect her son, notified the childcare centre in Canberra immediately after her son told her what had happened to him, but, after three weeks without any response from the police, she contacted them herself.
It was only then that she learned the childcare centre had erased crucial CCTV footage — stored for only a short time before being overwritten. The only remaining evidence was 20 minutes of footage and a recording she had made of her son.
She said the centre was constantly churning staff. ""It was all about profit,"" she said.
When it comes to sexual misconduct and offences, at least one incident a day is reported in childcare centres in Victoria, WA and NSW. Only three states have reportable schemes, so it is likely to be far higher.
Workers have come out strongly, discussing on social media their experiences in child care.
One said: ""I would feel physically ill thinking about going to work. They only cared about profit and would make you go against everything you believed in or stood for. It broke me.""
Another recounted: ""I know a child reported sexual assault (didn't witness it), the centre barely investigated, threatened the parents and the educator still works there.""
Others voiced their frustrations: ""The regulators let it happen. Profit and children don't mix"".
Professor Allan Fels, eminent economist and former chair of the ACCC, said fast action and a royal commission to fix childcare were a must.
""State and federal governments are spending billions on grants and subsidies and an investment into a royal commission is nothing compared to the potential savings and better service from looking into the situation well,"" he said.
Four Corners exposed the corporatisation of Australia's childcare sector, where profit often outweighs care.
Using national data, it revealed how the shift had come at the expense of quality.
In the past three years, serious incidents have risen 27 per cent to 26,000, including serious injuries, trauma, ambulances called at childcare centres and children going missing.
Given serious incidents are chronically under-reported, this is an alarming trend.
It coincides with the growing dominance of the for-profit sector, which now accounts for almost three-quarters of long day care. Of the 300 to 400 new childcare centres opening each year, a staggering 95 per cent are for-profit.
The rise of for-profit operators coincides with increasing government subsidies to the sector. In the past year, the federal government allocated more than $14 billion in childcare subsidies and state governments spent billions in grants.
This coupled with regulation that is not fit for purpose, is letting parents and their children down.
Former corporate lawyer and current NSW Greens politician Abigail Boyd has been trying to expose the industry's secrets for months.
""Nobody wants people to know what's actually going on,"" Boyd says.
In November, Boyd invoked a Standing Order 52 (SO52) — a powerful parliamentary order to force the release of internal departmental documents to scrutinise the regulator's handling of breaches in the childcare sector.
She requested incident reports detailing injuries, neglect, abuse and safety hazards, along with the regulator's responses.
""I wanted to see for myself exactly how effective the regulator was in making sure that these places were fit to send our children to.""
The department and government have been pushing back.
The child and others were left in highchairs for hours at a time, force fed, pinched, yanked, and thrown to the ground.
""It has been five months trying to get this information,"" Boyd said.
""Other states make this information public.""
On Tuesday afternoon, Boyd passed a censure motion calling for the release of the documents.
The government now has 14 days to comply and release the files or face further sanction.
Boyd has seen some of the documents, which are sitting in privilege boxes, and wants them released publicly.
""If the public had even the slightest idea of how horrendous these incidents are in a lot of these centres, there would be an absolute uproar. And they don't wanna have to deal with that. They don't wanna have to deal with the angry parents wanting to know why they weren't told earlier that these things were happening at the places they're leaving their children,"" she said.
The brutal reality is there are good centres and good educators — but finding good-quality care is getting harder.
It's why a royal commission or public inquiry is important, to expose systemic failures, hold those responsible to account and deliver enforceable recommendations for real reform.
Without it, we risk a continuation of motivated ignorance by governments to address the real problems.",ABC News,finance
Major underground power transmission line proposed for western Victoria,Angus Verley,https://www.abc.net.au/news/rural/2025-03-21/underground-transmission-proposal-for-western-victoria/105075456,"The company behind a proposed new underground transmission line for Victoria says if it were to go ahead, it would delay the need to build the controversial projects known as Western Renewables Link [WRL] and the southern half of VNI West.
Syncline Energy is proposing building a 250km direct current transmission line from Charlton, in the state's central west, to Melbourne.
It would run beneath the median strip of the Calder Freeway for the southern part of the route and across farmland between Bendigo and Charlton.
At the Melbourne end, it would connect to the Melbourne Renewable Energy Hub – a massive battery facility Syncline was involved in developing.
Farmers oppose the government's current plan to build transmission towers on their land. (ABC South East SA: Sam Bradbrook)
The company's managing director, Philip Galloway, said he believed it was a more feasible option than current transmission plans.
""We think that Western Renewables is probably too expensive for electricity consumers in Victoria to be supported and we think it could be either delayed or [pushed back],"" he said.
""In terms of VNI West, there's still a need to connect Victoria up into New South Wales and the northern part of VNI West makes sense, the southern part is a little bit harder to justify.""
While VNI West and WRL have met huge community and farmer opposition, Mr Galloway said his project had the backing of landowners.
""If people say they don't want it, we look for an alternative route, but in almost every case, people have been happy to host the cable on their land.""
Proposed above-ground towers across western Victoria could be as tall as 85 metres. (Facebook: Power and Water Corporation)
And landowners agree.
""Phil came and sat around the table with us, ran over the process and answered any questions we raised,"" said Graham Nesbit, a farmer near Wedderburn, in the path of the transmission line.
""If it goes ahead, great, if it doesn't at least we've tried.
Mr Nesbit said this was a ""stark contrast"" to how farmers were treated during the consultation process of VNI West.
""We weren't getting any answers to questions we were asking continuously,"" he said.
Graham Nesbit applauded the Syncline consultation process. (ABC News)
Mr Galloway said the project needed the support of the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) and the Victorian government, and he was confident of receiving it.
He said landowners would be paid about $40,000 per year for every kilometre of transmission line under their land.
""The response so far has been that there have been no red flags identified in terms of our approach to ecology, planning, engineering design and our use of the Calder Freeway median strip,"" he said.
An energy policy expert said the proposal deserved serious consideration.
Bruce Mountain, head of the Victoria Energy Policy Centre at Victoria University, has been highly critical of new transmission planning in the state's west.
Professor Mountain said the Syncline proposal could address some of the social concerns that had arisen over plans for large-scale, overhead transmission lines, which has delayed the rollout.
'""I think it deserves a jolly good hearing,"" he said.
""I think it is seeking to respond to community concerns of the social costs associated with very large high-voltage transmission lines.
""I think there's enough merit to it to cause the Australian Energy Market Operator and the Victorian government to put on hold their proposals until it has been thoroughly looked at.""
Bruce Mountain has long criticised AEMO's national energy plan. (ABC News Sean Warren)
Professor Mountain said direct current technology, involving less transmission loss than alternating current, made sense.
""It's using underground very high voltage DC technology, which we know is growing globally as a solution to major new AC transmission lines,"" he said.
Professor Mountain implored the state government to be open-minded about the proposal.
""I think an issue for the government now is to find a way to walk back from their ironclad commitment that was so clearly problematic and to look at [this proposal],"" he said.
""I'm afraid this is the nature of the energy transition, there is simply too much unknown that you only learn in the process of doing it, and the job of government is to be responsive to new information.""

In a statement, a Victorian government spokesperson said initial analysis of the Syncline proposal showed ""significant challenges, including costs, which would be passed onto consumers through their bills, and accessing the Calder Freeway for extended periods during construction"".
""VicGrid will continue to assess the project with the proponent.""
A spokesperson for AEMO-subsidiary Transmission Company Victoria – which is planning VNI West – said ""at this stage, the proposed underground transmission project had no implications for the VNI West project"".

"From price gouging to promotion tactics, here are the key takeaways from the ACCC's supermarkets report",Kate Ainsworth,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-21/accc-supermarkets-inquiry-key-takeaways-coles-woolworths-aldi/105079916,"It's been 12 months in the making, but an inquiry into Australia's supermarkets by the competition watchdog has been unable to conclude whether price gouging is taking place.
Frequent allegations of price gouging during the pandemic and cost of living crisis that followed prompted the federal government to direct the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) to investigate the country's supermarkets last year.
But the long-awaited report — the first of its kind in 16 years — declared that Australia is home to one of the most profitable supermarket sectors in the world, and Woolworths and Coles don't have a strict duopoly.
And despite the furore over rising prices, the ACCC noted there's nothing illegal about businesses making a profit.
Here are the key takeaways from the full 441-page report, and what it means for shoppers at the check-out.
The pandemic and cost-of-living crisis that followed have seen grocery prices rapidly increase in the past five years, with the report putting the bulk of those hikes down to the rising cost of doing business.
However, the inquiry found that Coles, Woolworths and Aldi increased their product and operating margins at the same time — meaning that rising prices aren't totally down to higher costs, and some of the extra cash they're making is going into their coffers.
The consumer watchdog finds Australia's supermarkets are more profitable than their global peers and the two majors don't need to compete ""vigorously"", but the ACCC stops short of declaring grocery prices excessive.
It also found that Woolworths is consistently the most profitable of the large supermarket chains in Australia, and is making higher margins at its smaller-format Woolworths Metro stores.
""While input and operational costs have increased over this time, Coles and Woolworths have maintained or increased their product margins,"" the report said.
On an international scale, the ACCC found those margins are among the most profitable in the world by comparing their three-year operating and profit margins to global giants such as Walmart, Tesco and Sainsbury's.
""Whilst not necessarily the most profitable, the supermarkets in Australia enjoy quite strong levels of profitability,"" ACCC deputy chair Mick Keogh said.
Woolworths recorded a profit of $739 million in the first half of the current financial year, with Coles reporting a $576 million profit during the same period.
Woolworths makes up almost 40 per cent of supermarket grocery sales in Australia. (ABC News: Jak Rowland)
Despite their increased profit margins, the ACCC was unable to conclusively say whether Woolworths and Coles were actively price gouging.
The supermarket giants had been plagued by gouging allegations during the cost-of-living crisis — claims both had consistently denied — and that's what ultimately led to the government directing the ACCC to hold the inquiry.
""We didn't reach that [price gouging] conclusion, and part of the reason is the complexity of making that when you look at the range of products and the different margins that they have, and the fact that they change pricing almost on a weekly basis,"" Mr Keogh said.
ACCC deputy chair Mick Keogh says price gouging is a complex issue. (ABC News: John Gunn)
However, the report noted it did not seek to determine whether the prices or margins of Coles, Woolworths, Aldi or Metcash were ""excessive"", as charging high prices, having high margins, and exercising market power is not prohibited under the Competition and Consumer Act, which regulates supermarket conduct.
Essentially, running a business at a profit and lifting prices isn't illegal.
But if there was greater competition between the supermarkets, the ACCC would expect their profit margins to be lower, either through lower retail prices, higher costs to improve service quality, or both.
So will there be greater competition any times soon? Not likely, according to the regulator.
Coles and Woolworths have been referred to as 'ColesWorth' due to their dominance in the supermarket space, with the ACCC finding the two make up two-thirds of supermarket grocery sales nationally.
The ACCC found that Woolworths makes up 38 per cent of all supermarket grocery sales nationally, while Coles has 29 per cent — and it expects that dominance to continue.
Woolworths and Coles are emphasising the threat of Aldi — is it really a competitive force to be reckoned with?
During the hearings, Woolworths and Coles argued that they both face increasing competition from Aldi and Metcash (which is behind IGA franchises), and non-traditional grocery retailers such as Amazon, Bunnings and Chemist Warehouse.
However, the ACCC found those claims weren't entirely accurate, with Aldi representing just 9 per cent of national grocery sales, and Metcash accounting for 7 per cent.
It described Aldi as a ""crucial lower-priced alternative"" and helped put downward pressure on prices, but the German-based company ""does not compete head-to-head with Coles and Woolworths"" on all of their products.
Despite their market dominance however, the ACCC said there is not a duopoly in the supermarket sector — rather that it was an oligopoly, or a market with a small number of large players.
""Aldi, Coles and Woolworths, each have their established position in the market, and yes, they have specials and promotions and all sorts of things.
""But when you look at their pricing in the longer term, particularly Coles and Woolworths, it's largely similar, and their product range is largely similar. So that's what we mean by an oligopoly.""
Coles accounts for 29 per cent of supermarket grocery sales in Australia. (ABC News: Curtis Rodda)
The report identified the extensive use of promotions in supermarkets as having a ""significant impact"" on what shoppers purchase, but said they can make it difficult for consumers to know if they're getting value for money.
The ABC analysed the online prices of nearly 44,000 products at Coles and Woolworths, revealing a sales technique used on thousands of items.
Different pricing strategies, such as cyclical ""high-low"" discounting, where products are placed on weekly or fortnightly specials, and ""everyday low pricing"" can confuse shoppers about the ""real"" price of a product.
The ACCC didn't conclusively say whether the price cycles amounted to the supermarkets colluding with each other, but there was ""quite strong evidence of that phenomena"" throughout the report.
""We saw quite a lot of products where the price pattern between the two majors, for example, looks like an extended ABC logo,"" Mr Keogh said.
""They take it in turns in being half-price one week and then normal price the next week, while the other's at half price.
The ACCC says promotions and pricing strategies by supermarkets can confuse shoppers. (AAP: Darren England)
While unit pricing is a helpful resource for shoppers to compare prices, the ACCC wants to see minimum information requirements for discount promotions to ""improve transparency and consumer understanding"".
Similarly, the report found supermarkets need to be transparent when package sizes shrink disproportionately to price (a phenomenon known as ""shrinkflation"").
Loyalty programs run by Coles and Woolworths were also identified as being valuable to the supermarkets, but those benefits don't always translate to its members — and that's something the ACCC has recommended the supermarkets take a closer look at.
The dominance of Coles and Woolworths in the grocery retail space also extends to the supply chain, especially to growers and suppliers who provide the two major supermarkets with fresh produce.
Woolworths's bosses will face the ACCC's inquiry into supermarket pricing today, as the consumer watchdog continues to prosecute its case that the corporate giant and its competitor Coles have been dudding their customers on discounts.
""In some cases — but not all — grocery suppliers are dependent on Coles or Woolworths for the ongoing viability of their business,"" the report said.
The watchdog described the situation facing suppliers as a ""monopsony"", where there is effectively only one buyer for their products, and can use their strong standing in the industry to get lower wholesale prices.
""We consider that in these markets, bargaining positions are highly unbalanced in favour of Coles and Woolworths and that they have the potential to exercise monopsony power,"" the report said.
The report found many suppliers feared raising concerns with the supermarkets, worried it would ultimately put their business at risk, and don't have enough certainty or information to make investment decisions.
The findings are vindication for suppliers who have long raised concerns about the power imbalance when dealing with the supermarket giants.

The ACCC says there's no ""silver bullet"" to address all of the issues identified in its full report, but has recommended a suite of potential legislative and policy reforms to address areas that aren't working well — particularly when it comes to competition in the industry.
The results of comparing identical groceries at different supermarkets were hardly surprising to anyone who has set foot in one in the past 18 months. How many more same-same-but-different reports will tell us what we already know?
That said, the watchdog believes Woolworths and Coles will still dominate the supermarket sector, and doesn't see that changing for the ""foreseeable future"", despite the presence of Aldi and Metcash.
All up, the ACCC made 20 recommendations for change, but that will require the action of the federal government, which is yet to commit to implementing them.
For its part, the federal government will include $2.9 million in next week's budget to help suppliers ""stand up to the big supermarkets"", but has not provided further detail.
Even with the recommendations, the National Farmers' Federation believes more could be done to specifically support suppliers.
""Farmers just want to make sure they're getting a fair deal and that transparency, that ability for them to negotiate, still isn't coming through in a lot of these recommendations,"" the group's president David Jochinke said.
As for the supermarkets themselves, Woolworths, Coles and Metcash have said they are reviewing the report in detail and will consider the recommendations put forward by the ACCC.",ABC News,finance
Coles and Woolworths shares surge after 'benign' report into supermarket sector — as it happened,Stephanie Chalmers,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-21/asx-markets-business-live-news-21-03-25/105079680,"Shares in supermarket giants Coles and Woolworths surged on Friday, as a report into the sector was made public.
Investors seemed to cheer the competition regulator's findings that major grocery chains had increased their margins and that their dominance in the sector was set to continue.
Woolworths shares closed 6.3 per cent higher at $29.93 — its best one-day gain since March 2020.
Coles shares rose 4.9 per cent, while shares in IGA-supplier Metcash gained 3.6 per cent.
""While we do see heightened media publicity around the announcement as likely to negatively impact the supermarkets in the near-term we do not expect a material impact to supermarket earnings from the recommendations,"" Citi analysts said in a note, which called the report ""benign"", according to Reuters.
Senior research analyst Craig Woolford from MST Marquee said investors were breathing a sigh of relief.
""There have been concerns amongst investors there would be significant consequences for the supermarkets.
""While there will be ongoing scrutiny, the ACCC report has concluded that the supermarkets are not responsible for price gouging. The share price response is definitely best described as a 'relief rally'.""
The major supermarkets responded to the report by arguing the Australian grocery market is highly competitive, despite the findings of an oligopoly.
Woolworths said it supported recommendations to improve transparency for buyers and suppliers, and would review the report.
Coles similarly said it would review the recommendations and supported better transparency but cautioned ""against measures that will increase red tape and drive up costs"".
The broader market rose marginally, with the strong performance from consumer stocks offsetting falls the for education, healthcare and technology sectors.
The S&P/ASX 200 gained 0.2 per cent on Friday, leaving it 1.8 per cent higher for the week.
That's the first weekly gain for the benchmark index in more than a month.

Unless you take meticulous notes of everything you have ever bought at the shops, chances are you've also been impacted by 'shrinkflation'.
The phenomenon refers to a product being downsized when its price either remains the same or increases.
It was a key concern raised by the tens of thousands of consumers surveyed by the ACCC throughout its supermarkets inquiry.
To curb the practice, the regulator has recommended supermarkets be required to publish notifications when shrinkflation occurs.

Steve Ronalds, a co-founder of Victorian milk company Gibson Jersey, criticised major supermarkets for selling milk at a loss to attract customers.
He says retailers offer up discounted products as ""bait to drive in consumers"" by pressuring small suppliers like his to maintain high margins on milk, which then subsidises the cheap milk on supermarket shelves.
""We have to be profitable, and we just can't drop the price. They do ask us to drop the price, or ask how we can supply it cheaper, and we just say we can't,"" he told ABC News.
""Unfortunately consumers are going to have to pay a little bit more if they want to have an Australian industry. Imports are increasing as our local manufacturing is falling off.""
Gibson Jersey says products were removed from 65 Coles stores in Victoria mid-last year for refusing to give the supermarket a bigger profit margin.
Despite being removed from those stores, Ronalds said his sales had increased in independent supermarkets, indicating consumer support for local agriculture
He called for fair milk prices, collective action among suppliers and greater transparency in the industry.

It's been 12 months in the making, but an inquiry into Australia's supermarkets by the competition watchdog has been unable to conclude whether price gouging is taking place.

Data from the Australia Bureau of Statistics (ABS) shows 52,800 jobs were lost from the economy in February.
The fall in employment has been attributed to fewer older workers returning to work in February, with employment among older age groups lower than in the same month in 2024.
It raises the bets for an interest rate cut in May, with three of the Big Four banks forecasting one, but that will depend on the next round of quarterly inflation figures due to be released in April.

Coles and Woolies are both up significantly. Was the ACCC report really that good for them?
- Andy Smith
A good question above from reader Andy.
Further from my previous post featuring comments on this from analyst George Boubouras, here is another take on why Coles and Woolworths stocks are rallying today.
Craig Woodford, senior research analyst at MST Marquee, had this to say:
""There have been concerns amongst investors there would be significant consequences for the supermarkets.
While there will be ongoing scrutiny, the ACCC report has concluded that the supermarkets are not responsible for price gouging. The share price response is definitely best described as a 'relief rally'.""
In short, investors reckon the supermarkets have come out the ACCC investigation relatively unscathed.
Currently Coles share price is up 4.5%, to $19.40.
Woolworths has gained 5.5% to $29.72.

Supermarket analyst George Boubouras, managing director of research and investments at K2 Asset Management, has sent through some thoughts on the ACCC's supermarkets report.
He says the ACCC report reinforces that Woolworths and Coles are some of the most profitable supermarkets globally:
""Their margins have fallen however remains high vs global peers which is a key attribute of oligopoly pricing power. Interestingly, the report concluded there is limited evidence of pricing power within the sector. This is clearly very supportive for their share price as some regulatory uncertainty has now been removed.
Despite the increased competition over the past decade, the market share of the major supermarkets still remains one of the highest globally.
Given this persistent market dominance of both COL and WOW, it is difficult to reconcile that this does not lead to “structural” dominance in the sector, from supply chain through to pricing.
The ACCC report is a welcomed report that at the very least keeps the basic concepts of the highly concentrated Australian supermarket sector front and centre for ongoing debate.""
But he says, in the short term, the ACCC report is ""a great result for both COL and WOW given the circumstances. ""
That's because despite the millions spent on investigating supermarket power, as Boubouras points out the ACCC has not produced any concrete or structural findings of wrongdoing. Something Boubouras finds hard to reconcile.
Market dominance, yes. But not much more than that.
Boubouras says the findings on supermarket prices are good news for investors.
Basically, investors are happy about the market dominance, profits and what that means for them as shareholders.

""For decades, America's pharmaceutical giants have been plotting to torpedo Australia's Pharmaceuticals Benefits Scheme (PBS),"" writes our chief business correspondent Ian Verrender.
Twenty years ago, they scored a huge victory when they secured major concessions from the Howard government, as America and Australia negotiated the Australia-US Free Trade Agreement.
Big pharma was at it again during the Obama years when Australia was on the cusp of signing up to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP).
A multilateral trade deal, the TPP was designed to build a regional bloc against China.
Buried in the detail, however, were clauses that quietly entrenched the power of major American corporations.

A survey conducted by Canstar Blue shows 43 per cent of Australians have altered their shopping habits between now and when the ACCC's inquiry into the supermarket sector was announced last January.
Of the 3,000 people asked about their attitudes towards Coles and Woolworths since the probe commenced, 23 per cent said they were more cautious when shopping with both retailers and 17 per cent admitted they were choosing to shop with them less frequently.
And just over one in three respondents said the legal inquiry had not changed where they shopped.
The research also shows some Australians are already doing their supermarket shop across different stores, with 35 per cent splitting their grocery shopping between outlets to maximise their savings.

Consumer advocacy group Choice has welcomed the government's in-principle support for the ACCC's recommendations to regulate confusing promotions, shrinkflation, and price ambiguity.
""We need to fix the power imbalance between supermarkets and consumers and price transparency will help us do that,"" Choice CEO Ashley de Silva said.
Research conducted by Choice last year showed 1 in 4 people found it difficult to identify whether certain supermarket labels represented a true discount.
""Sometimes labels claim a discount, but don’t specify how much or note the previous shelf price, making the claim impossible for consumers to verify. Introducing minimum information requirements on price displays will help stop supermarkets obscuring endless price increases,” de Silva said.
To combat shrinkflation, an instance where a product’s size decreases but the price either remains the same or increases, the ACCC has recommended supermarkets be required to publish notifications when this occurs.
The supermarkets inquiry final report has made 20 recommendations in total.

The Business Council of Co-operatives and Mutuals (BCCM) has backed the ACCC's recommendation calling for federal measures to incentivise more community owned and co-operative supermarket stores in regional and remote areas.
""With cost of living issues likely to be front and centre during the election campaign this ACCC report will put the spotlight on Canberra's response and how it plans to make life just a bit easier for those who vote but don't live in metropolitan areas,"" BCCM CEO Melina Morrison said.
""Consumers outside the big cities will continue to suffer when it comes to their shopping bill on food  and groceries because of the clear oligopoly in the supermarket sector.""
In its report, the ACCC noted major supermarket operators are dominant in areas outside key cities, with limited choices for consumers.
""As  such, supporting existing – and new – community-owned stores in remote areas that would  otherwise be unserved or under-served may be an effective way to address some of the issues that  result from lack of competition in those areas,” the report said.

Chief executive of Aldi Australia Anna McGrath says the ACCC's inquiry into the supermarket sector confirms Aldi's role in offering products at ""everyday low prices"".
The consumer watchdog's report noted that Aldi, Coles and Woolworths appeared to have some of the highest profit margins among supermarkets worldwide.
It found that the latter two had ""limited incentive to compete vigorously with each other on price"", and that Aldi was providing a bit of extra competition.
Here's McGrath's response to the report:
""We've seen more customers turning to ALDI and we take pride in offering consistent value week in and week out, so our customers don't have to chase discounts or specials.
We keep prices low through extraordinary efficiency across our whole business. From our curated range of 1,800 quality products, simplified packaging, our line-up of exclusive brands and our Australian first sourcing policy, to how we stack the shelves and load our trucks — delivering value to our customers is built into our business model.""
She added that a new website due for release next month would include pricing for all of Aldi's core range and discounted items, seeking to make it easier for customers to compare products between retailers.

Metcash, which runs the IGA brand, has responded to the ACCC's inquiry.
Here is their response in full:
As discussed throughout the inquiry, an independent network is integral to healthy competition in the supermarket sector in Australia.
We are pleased that the ACCC has recognised this, particularly the competitive role independents play in many local communities where they are able to better tailor their range and offer to the preferences of locals.
While we still need to go through the detail of all the recommendations outlined in the report, we support the ACCC in its view that despite the progress independents have made on better prices, there are other significant barriers for independent retailers to compete with the major chains. We too are concerned with the growing dominance of the major supermarket chains in Australia and their ability to continue to grow through creeping acquisitions of independents and land banking.
We encourage the Government to take further action in these areas.

Solomon Lew's Premier Investments has posted its half-year results this morning.
Net profit was down 34% to $117.1 million, in the six months to January 2025, as consumers pulled back spending on discretionary spending.
The results predate Premier's sale of five fashion brands to department store Myer, which finalised on January 26. Those brands include Portmans, Dotti and Jacquie E.
During that half of the year, Premier had a 31% stake in Myer, however since the acquisition deal the company no longer holds any interest in the company.
Instead, the deal cemented Solomon Lew as Myer's biggest shareholder. Lew and his family, through Lew Group, own a 27.7% stake in the company.
Premier holds a 25% stake in kitchen appliance maker Breville.
Premier's retail division is now comprised of Smiggle and Peter Alexander.
Stationary brand Smiggle's sales were down 14.5% on the 1H24, with Premier attributing the fall to a ""challenging global discretionary retail environment, with the Smiggle customer particularly exposed to increased cost of living pressures in all global markets.""
Peter Alexander sales were up 6.6% to $297.7 million.
However, that excluded the results of the recently launched Peter Alexander UK.
Premier's Chairman Solomon Lew had this to say about the results:
“Premier currently continues to own the high margin, iconic brands of Peter Alexander and Smiggle. Both brands will fully focus on leveraging growth in existing markets and expanding their reach in new markets through further international expansion in the coming years. In addition, Premier continues to hold its substantial investment in Breville Group, strategic property ownership and significant cash reserves.
The outcomes and value created for Premier shareholders in 1H25 represents the culmination of years of focus and investment in our brands through providing quality and exciting products to our customers while creating and unlocking value for our shareholders.""
Premier's share price was up half a per cent to $21.52.
(EDIT NOTE: This post has been updated to reflect that Premier has not held an interest in Myer since the acquisition deal.)

""Obviously, supply chains cost money and for farmers to produce that affordable food at the high quality is also a cost price squeeze that farmers have felt throughout the last not only COVID period but prior to this in many sectors of the supermarket trolley, have not necessarily increased their prices or increased the price that farmers are receiving,"" Jochinke told Radio National Breakfast.
He added that ""agriculture still doesn't believe in many sectors, especially in the horticulture area, that we're getting a fair deal.""

Household battery storage surges as plunging solar tariffs improve the economics,Rhiana Whitson,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-19/household-battery-solar-feed-in-tariffs-energy-power/105063612,"Kevin Wen is one of a growing number of Australians with rooftop solar who have decided the economics of installing a battery storage system finally stack up.
In 2022, Mr Wen was getting about 15 cents per kilowatt-hour for exporting his excess energy back into the grid.
""Then they lowered the buyback price to 8 cents, and then 5 cents, and then 3 cents now,"" Mr Wen tells ABC News.

He's far from alone. About 75,000 battery storage systems were installed across Australia last year — up 47 per cent from 2023.
That brings the total of home battery storage systems across the country to more than 320,000, according to solar energy consultancy SunWiz.
Chris Williams, CEO of Natural Solar, a company that now installs about 100 batteries a week, says the reduction in solar feed-in tariffs has been a tipping point for many of his customers.
""Solar feed-in tariffs, effectively, are a rate that the household will receive when power is sent back to the grid during the day from your solar panels,"" Mr Williams says.
""Now, that rate, historically, may have been 15 cents or 20 cents per kilowatt-hour fed back to the grid.
""What we're seeing today, that might be as low as, you know, 2 or 3 cents in New South Wales, in Victoria, it might be as low as, you know, less than 1 cent.""
Solar tariffs have also been as high as 60 cents per kilowatt-hour in Victoria, while New South Wales also offered generous incentives for the solar power people used themselves.
Governments once stumbled over themselves to shower money on rooftop solar owners. So why have export payments tanked up to 99.93pc?
In certain circumstances, Mr Williams says, nowadays households will actually be charged for sending power back to the grid.
Rising power bills, which are set to increase again in July, by 2–9 per cent depending on where you live, are also driving the boom in household battery installations.
Mr Williams's business has received 250 per cent more battery enquiries since the regulated price increases were announced just last week.
""Consumers and households are very sensitive at this point in time, particularly on the back of the cost-of-living crisis we're in, when they see that their power price is going to go up.""
Households can save about $1,500 a year on power bills with rooftop solar, and another $1,000 with battery storage, according to the Smart Energy Council.
More than 4 million Australian households and businesses have rooftop solar but, despite the additional savings, only about one in 12 have battery storage.
The high purchase price of batteries has been a barrier for many.
""Batteries are, on average, around about $10,000 per system.
""We have seen prices come down year-on-year by between 5 and 10 per cent and we do expect that trend to continue,"" Mr Williams says.
""The average battery should have a return on investment between six to eight years before subsidies — including subsidies, that may be as little as five to seven years for the average household.""
Solar energy consultancy SunWiz has crunched the numbers on how long it takes to make your money back on a combined solar and battery system.
The ""payback time"" now sits at about 8.3 years, which includes a mix of subsidised and non-subsidised systems.

Battery subsidies are currently only available through the New South Wales and the Northern Territory governments.
Other jurisdictions — like Victoria, Tasmania and the ACT — offer interest-free loans for batteries.
As the federal budget and election loom, there are calls for a national government subsidy, similar to the existing scheme for rooftop solar, to further reduce the cost of batteries.
""Solar energy, of course, doesn't work at night-time, so what we want is a battery booster scheme that helps people take the energy from the middle of the day and use it in the evening when they're home from work and school,"" Smart Energy Council CEO John Grimes tells ABC News.
The Smart Energy Council, a peak body for the renewable energy industry, is calling for a national subsidy of $350 per kilowatt-hour (kWh).

In layman's terms, that would reduce the cost of a small 5kWh battery to about $3,000, or $7,000 for a larger 10kWh battery.
Mr Grimes says battery storage systems would allow households to avoid higher prices when cheaper solar energy is unavailable.
""What solar batteries do is, they time-shift energy from the middle of the day, when it's super-cheap, to make that super-cheap energy available at night-time, when prices spike,"" Mr Grimes says.
Modelling by the Smart Energy Council shows that if Australia reaches 1 million solar batteries by 2030, households will save more than $19 billion.
Households are handing over control of their solar systems in exchange for equipment. Experts believe virtual power plants could play a vital part in our future energy system.
""There's a saving not just for the householder, but for the whole community. That's because we're taking pressure off when electricity prices are high.
Other renewable energy industry groups, including the Clean Energy Council, are calling for a national rebate for batteries of up to $6,500.
Last year, the centrepiece of the federal budget was the $3.5 billion in energy bill relief for households, which amounted to a $300 rebate for households and $325 for small businesses.
Those rebates not only reduced household power bills but worked to bring down inflation.
Former RBA deputy governor Guy Debelle argues there is a better way to shield households from energy price inflation, which is subject to global shocks such as Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

The former central banker, who also spent a period at Fortescue Future Industries, says instead of bill rebates, money should be spent on subsidies for batteries and increased incentives for bringing down the cost of solar.
""The relief to household budgets is only temporary, while they're receiving those cash payments.
""You could repurpose that money to provide them with the opportunity to get rooftop solar and batteries to provide much more long-lasting insulation from energy prices.""
Mr Debelle says those incentives should also target low-income households, strata buildings and landlords.
""Sun isn't subject to geopolitics, so it's not going to be affected by Russia invading Ukraine,"" he says.
Kevin Wen is glad he'll be less reliant on the grid and therefore less exposed to price spikes.
Mr Wen was able to get $2,000 off the cost of his home battery storage system under the NSW government scheme, but says higher subsidies would encourage more people to take up solar and batteries.
""If they want to promote green energy, it is really good to increase the subsidies right now … If they can increase it, that will be great for everyone.""
Energy experts spoken to for this story say increased subsidies, not loans, will be the best way to increase the uptake of solar batteries.
A spokesperson for the federal minister for climate change and energy Chris Bowen said in a statement:
""The government is always looking for ways to ease household budget pressure.
""Through our Household Energy Upgrades Fund, we're providing $1 billion to help Australian home owners lower their energy bills through discounted green loans for energy upgrades, such as solar panels and batteries.""",ABC News,finance
"Chris Bowen 'pleased' with interest in WA's offshore wind farm zone, despite six developers pulling out",BBy Bridget McArthur,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-22/more-offshore-wind-developers-pull-out-western-australia/105077650,"Three more developers have abandoned a proposed offshore wind farm in Western Australia despite having invested millions of dollars and several years to get their foot in the door.
Federal Energy Minister Chris Bowen approved the approximately 4,000 square kilometre farm, about 40 kilometres off the coast of Bunbury in the state's South West in September last year.
He invited companies to apply for feasibility licences to conduct further research and consultations with a view to leading the project.
Scottish and Danish developers — Flotation Energy and Copenhagen Energy — are the latest proponents to confirm their withdrawal, joining Oceanex, Skyborn Renewables, and Alinta Energy, while Jera/Parkwind, a developer based in Belgium, has also just withdrawn.

Asked about the exodus of some of the project's earliest proponents, Mr Bowen said he was ""pleased with the level of interest"".
He revealed four other ""international"" developers had submitted applications, which he said was a ""good number"".
Copenhagen Energy CEO Jasmin Bejdic said his company pulled out amid considerable challenges facing the WA project, and those remaining were more likely to be big conglomerates.
He said while some anti-offshore-wind advocates might celebrate his company's withdrawal, it would ultimately make the process less competitive.
Mr Bowen's office has declined to name the four remaining developers.
The ABC is aware of at least three companies that have previously expressed an interest in building an offshore wind farm in Western Australia who are yet to publicly withdraw: DIRECT Infrastructure, Wind With Purpose, and Triangle Energy/Pilot Energy.

Copenhagen Energy spent about four years preparing to compete for a feasibility licence.
In the end, Mr Bejdic said even if the company had been granted a licence, it probably would not have taken it.
""We probably should have pulled the plug earlier,"" he said.
Mr Bejdic said the decision to withdraw came down to a lack of evidence that WA would have the grid connections and offtake demand necessary to make the project viable.

Flotation Energy's head of Australian operations, Carolyn Sanders, said it was a ""disappointing"" decision to pull out.
""In the end, we're a global company and we had lower-risk places to deploy our capital,"" she said.

Copenhagen Energy has closed its Bunbury office and Flotation Energy will soon close its Perth office.
Both companies claimed the WA government had provided minimal support to offshore wind projects, and that there was not enough collaboration between state and federal governments.
""When we look at the subsidy levels that the oil industry gets and the gas industry gets, it's humungous compared to renewables,"" Mr Bejdic said.

Both Flotation Energy and Copenhagen Energy said they were unlikely to pursue offshore wind projects anywhere in Australia in the near future.
In response to the developers' concerns, a spokesperson for Mr Bowen said the government was looking forward to offering licences for ""multiple high-quality projects imminently"".
Earlier this month, the federal government pulled the plug on a Victorian offshore wind farm Flotation Energy had been working on due to regulatory issues around geographically overlapping applications.
The company had already been awarded a feasibility licence and completed $15 million of work when the project was axed.
With the federal energy minister at his side, recently re-elected Premier Roger Cook told reporters he had ""absolutely no objections to offshore wind farms"" and it would ""be an important part of what we do"".
It is a shift from previous WA Labor comments that offshore wind was not viable for the state in the foreseeable future.
Offshore wind consultant Tim Sawyer said developers had generally struggled with uncertainty surrounding projects in a double election year for the state.
Mr Sawyer said WA ministers might have avoided supporting offshore wind for fear of voter backlash ahead of the election earlier this month.

Meanwhile, the federal opposition has vowed to scrap the WA project altogether if elected, arguing the community does not want it.
""I'm optimistic that when we emerge out of the federal election, in particular, we'll then get a better sense of where offshore wind may sit in Australia and potentially WA,"" Mr Sawyer said.
After years of trying to get WA's offshore wind sector off the ground, Mr Sawyer said he planned to take a break from the space to focus on other renewable energy projects.",ABC News,finance
Levy on short-term rental bookings in Canberra will have 'very modest' impact on housing supply,MBy Monte Bovill,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-21/levy-short-term-rentals-airbnb-stayz-canberra/105078558,"A levy on short-term rental accommodation bookings will only have a ""very modest"" impact on increasing housing supply in Canberra, with the main aim of the planned tax to raise revenue, the ACT government says.
Booking service providers, like Airbnb and Stayz, will need to pay a five per cent levy on bookings from July, which will likely be passed on through to consumers, under legislation introduced this week.
ACT Treasurer Chris Steel said there were an estimated 1,100 short-term rentals in the territory, and expected the levy would have a ""very modest"" but ""positive"" impact on seeing some of them switch to long-term rentals.
""At a time when we do need more housing supply, it still has a potentially positive impact.""
ACT Treasurer Chris Steel says the levy's impact on long-term rental availability will likely be modest. (ABC News: Donal Sheil)
Instead, Mr Steel said the levy's primary purpose would be to generate revenue and ""level the playing field"".
""There are a range of existing accommodation providers, like hotels, that pay a range of taxes, including payroll taxes, that aren't paid by short-term rental providers,"" Mr Steel said.
The levy will apply to bookings of less than 28 days, and Mr Steel said the government expects the cost will be passed on to consumers.
""Booking service providers will have an obligation to register, lodge quarterly returns and pay the levy within 30 days at the end of the quarter,"" he said.
""Short stay platforms will remain an important part of the visitor economy.""
Exclusive data shared with the ABC shows the number of short-term rentals such as Airbnb in Australia has dropped dramatically.
The government committed to the levy in last year's budget, which estimated it would raise $3.8 million in its first year, followed by almost $4 million in 2026-27.
It's modelled on a 7.5 per cent levy imposed by the Victorian government on short stay accommodation.
""We have looked very closely at the Victoria model,"" Mr Steel said.
""There were significant issues with the implementation of the levy. We have learnt from that.
The Tasmanian government has also announced a five per cent levy, but is yet to implement it.
Eacham Curry of Stayz says the proposed method to collect the levy is inefficient. (Supplied: Stayz)
Stayz Senior Director of Government and Corporate Affairs, Eacham Curry, said the levy will ""cause disruption and confusion for travellers and hosts"".
""As proposed, the levy will be rushed into effect without sufficient time for proper testing,"" Mr Curry said.
Mr Curry also said the proposed method to collect the levy is ""inefficient"".
""[It] will add to the cost for travellers to the ACT and for mum and dad investors who are seeking to build for their future while also bringing unnecessary complexity to the sector overall,"" he said.
""A better approach would ensure less disruption that may drive away visitors and, ultimately, result in a better bottom-line for the ACT government.""
Airbnb's Head of Public Policy in Australia, Michael Crosby, said the platform had discussed options for the levy with the ACT government.
Michael Crosby of Airbnb says short-term rentals play an important role in the tourism sector. (ABC News: Shaun Kingma)
""Airbnb supports fair and evidence-based regulation of the short-term rental sector,"" Mr Crosby said.
""Airbnb believes the territory would benefit from a mandatory registration scheme, like those that operate in New South Wales and Tasmania, so the government has an accurate picture of the short-term rental sector.
Mr Crosby said it's ""important to get the balance right"" between addressing housing affordability, while not jeopardising the economic benefits that flow from short-term rentals.
ACT Greens leader Shane Rattenbury said the levy falls ""far short"" of addressing the housing crisis in Canberra.
""We are not opposed to the levy, per se, but I think we need to see it for what it is,"" he said.
""We have actually got a housing issue we need to deal with in the territory and that is why we think we do need to look at additional options.""
Greens Leader Shane Rattenbury says the levy will not increase the number of affordable long-term rental properties. (ABC News: Matt Roberts)
Mr Rattenbury said the number of short-stay rentals in the ACT was concerning.
""This small levy will fail to increase the number of affordable homes available to long-term renters, and it will fail to raise enough revenue to make a meaningful impact on the budget bottom line.""
The levy does not apply to hosted accommodation, where the occupant of the property lists a single room and resides in the property with the guest, or accommodation booked directly with a property owner.
Hotels, motels, serviced apartments, caravan parks, camping grounds and hostels are also excluded from the levy.",ABC News,finance

"Unemployment rate steady at 4.1pc in February as employment falls by 53,000",Stephanie Chalmers,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-20/unemployment-rate-steady-in-february-abs/105074546,"Australia's unemployment rate remained steady at 4.1 per cent in February, as labour force participation declined.
According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), 52,800 jobs were lost from the economy, well below forecasts of a 30,000 increase in employment.
The drop in employment came as fewer people were in work or looking for a job, with the participation rate falling to 66.8 per cent, from a record high of 67.3 per cent in January.
The ABS attributed part of the fall in employment to fewer older workers returning to work in February, with employment among older age groups lower than in the same month in 2024.
""This follows higher levels of employment in these age groups in recent years, particularly in 2024, alongside growth in the employment-to-population ratio over the last few years,"" ABS head of labour statistics Bjorn Jarvis said.
In January, the unemployment rate edged higher to 4.1 per cent, but the rate of workforce participation hit a new high and the number of jobs added significantly beat forecasts.
""The participation rate is still relatively high, having reached a historical high last month, and is 0.1 percentage points higher than this time last year,"" Mr Jarvis said.
The Reserve Bank's latest forecasts, released last month, are for the unemployment rate to average 4.2 per cent by mid-year, and remain around that level over the next few years.
January's jobs data was impacted by Australians waiting to return to work or start new roles after the summer break and economists have observed seasonal effects still playing out in February.
""We wouldn't be surprised if the sharp fall in employment last month is revised to a smaller one over the coming months,"" Capital Economics head of Asia-Pacific Marcel Thieliant wrote.
Betashares chief economist David Bassanese said the ""apparent steep fall in employment during February needs to be taken with a grain of salt"", pointing to ""turn-of-the-year seasonal adjustment problems"" since the pandemic.
The ABS said there were higher levels of retirement in Australia in recent month, and that it would release more detailed data on the trend next week.
The Australian dollar posted a modest decline following the release of the figures.
The RBA board will deliver its next interest rate decision on April 1 and the tight labour market has been on their radar, but economists do not expect this latest data to have a significant impact on their decision.
The Reserve Bank's chief economist says current economic uncertainty, especially around US tariffs, makes forecasting and rate setting more difficult.
Mr Thieliant said it provided ""no reason for the RBA to panic"", given the unemployment rate remained steady despite the shock decline in employment.
""Given that economic activity is now rebounding, we doubt that the labour market will loosen much further,"" he said.
""Accordingly, we still think that the [RBA] will only deliver a very shallow loosening cycle and have pencilled in just two more 25bp rate cuts.""
Callam Pickering, an economist at jobs site Indeed, noted it was the biggest fall in employment since December 2023 but described the jobs market as remaining ""healthy"".
""That earlier decline didn't derail Australia’s jobs boom and I suspect that'll be true of the February decline as well,"" he said.
""The Reserve Bank is unlikely to be too concerned… Certainly a decline in employment is undesirable, but the labour market remains incredibly tight.
""Another weaker outcome in March, however, would certainly give them a lot to think about.""
Mr Pickering forecast another interest rate cut in May or July.
A report finds one charity helping women into the workforce has generated $86 million in net direct economic benefits over the past 20 years.
ANZ Research had earlier forecast an August cut and maintained that call after Thursday's release.
""We don't think this print in isolation will have a material impact on the RBA’s monetary policy decisions moving forward,"" economist Aaron Luk and head of Australian Economics Adam Boyton wrote in a note.
""Labour market fundamentals remain solid, with an overall robust trend in employment growth, a low unemployment rate and an elevated level of job advertisements.""

That was until October, when she connected with Melbourne-based not-for-profit Fitted for Work, which helps women with practical skills, emotional support and even outfits to get back into the workforce.
Mariana received help with her resume, cover letter and attended workshops to boost her skills and her confidence.
""I felt every time I was feeling discouraged, when I wasn't getting through the application process, there was someone calling me and saying 'hey, Mariana, how is your job hunting going and how are you doing?'"" she recalls.
""In the end of this whole journey when I came here to do the fitting sessions, it was like Cinderella.

Mariana is one of 45,000 women and gender-diverse individuals the organisation has helped over the past two decades.
Analysis has found Fitted for Work cuts down the amount of time spent securing work to 26 weeks, or half the national average.
The study by economic research firm Mandala found for every $1 invested, there is an immediate economic return of $2.19, totalling $86 million in net direct economic benefits over the past 20 years.
""About 75 per cent of the benefit comes from savings from welfare,"" says Amit Singh, managing partner of Mandala.

""A quarter of the benefit comes form increased tax contributions.
""It's likely to be an underestimate of the total benefit because we don't take into account some of the longer-term impacts of securing employment,"" he says.
As Australia's unemployment rate rises, finding a job is getting more challenging. Some describe it like online dating.
According the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), nearly 520,000 women were underemployed in January — that is, looking for, and available for, more hours of work.
That's in addition to the 302,000 who were unemployed.
ABS data showed movement in the labour market at the start of the year was driven by women in the workforce.
Female employment rose by 44,000 in January, while female unemployment also increased, as more people looked for work.
""Even though Australia has a high rate of women completing education, it has a low rate of women's workforce participation,"" says Mr Singh.
""While we have been steadily increasing it for the last decade and a half, it's still relatively low compared to other countries.""
Increasing women's workforce participation is worth a lot to the economy, with research from the Women's Economic Equality Taskforce finding it could boost the economy by $128 billion.
But it's not an easy task.
""We have seen an increase in the complexity around why women are struggling to find work,"" Fitted for Work managing director Donna de Zwart says.

"Privatising child care and aged care promised lower costs, more choice. Experts say some consequences are 'devastating'",Gareth Hutchens,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-22/childcare-aged-care-abuse-neglect-privatisation-australia/105067714,"Revelations of abuse and neglect in childcare centres shocked Australians this week.
But they also raised a nagging question: have ""privatisation"" and ""marketisation"" in our social services sector lived up to their promise?
In the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s, Australian governments forced an increasing number of essential social services to be controlled by ""market logic"".
As the public outcry from educators and parents intensifies in the wake of the Four Corners investigation into Australia's broken childcare system, the reluctance of senior politicians responsible for overseeing the sector to do something to fix it is striking.
That process of ""marketisation"" — where the profit motive is used to regulate relationships between citizens and the state, and citizens and providers of social services, by transforming social relationships into market goods and services — has been applied to everything from education to health, housing, child care, aged care, and employment services.
Voters were told it would lower the cost of services, improve service quality, and increase ""consumer choice"".
But researchers say many of those policy areas have been plagued by real problems in recent years.
And major problems have hit two sectors that most Australians will have to interact with at opposite ends of their life cycle — child care and aged care.
The childcare sector has changed a lot in 50 years.
The federal government's involvement in childcare funding began in 1972 with the Child Care Act 1972.
Under the Act, federal funding was restricted to non-profit organisations and local government providers.
With centres reassessed on average every four years, and some gaming the system, parents cannot be sure their child's centre meets the standards or that staff are properly trained or qualified.
That funding model was based on advice from early childhood experts who believed good quality care was best provided in childcare centres operated by non-profit organisations.
But attitudes changed in the 1980s and 1990s.
In the early 1990s, the Hawke Labor government introduced market forces into the early childhood sector and encouraged the growth of for-profit providers by extending childcare assistance to for-profit care.
It said ""the market"" would lead to more choice and lower fees.
The Howard Coalition government, elected in 1996, continued down that path.
By the mid-2000s, the changes led to an Australian company, ABC Learning Centres, becoming the largest publicly-traded childcare provider in the world.
It listed on Australia's stock exchange in 2001 and five years later had a market capitalisation of $2.6 billion.

It had adapted its business model to accommodate the federal government's generous childcare subsidies, and it pursued an aggressive campaign of expansion and acquisition.
By 2006, it was receiving 44 per cent of its income from government subsidies ($128 million out of $292 million revenue).
Its founder, Eddy Groves, also ranked first on BRW's list of the richest Australians aged 40 and under with an estimated wealth of $260 million.
The corporate regulator ASIC ends its probe into ABC Learning's collapse without laying any more charges against its management.
By 2008, the company held about 20 to 25 per cent of the long day care market in Australia, providing care to over 100,000 children and employing about 16,000 staff.
But then the company went into voluntary liquidation, and the fallout was immense.
The federal government had to spend millions of dollars keeping open hundreds of childcare centres until the financial mess could be cleaned up and new owners found.
Writing about the sudden rise and fall of ABC Learning, researchers Deborah Brennan and Mab Oloman said the shift to privatised child care in Australia had had ""devastating consequences for parents, families and staff"".
""Australia, once regarded by international observers as having an enviable child care system, has become a case study for other countries in what not to do,"" they wrote.

In a Senate committee in 2009, Professor Brennan also said the degree of market concentration ABC Learning had accumulated in Australia had been exceptional internationally, and she was concerned about its impact on children.
""We really have entered into a vast national experiment with our children in Australia,"" she told senators.
Fast forward to this week, and a fresh series of stories from the ABC's Four Corners team has drawn attention to new problems in Australia's childcare sector, including shocking cases of neglect and abuse.
Professors Marianne Fenech and Gabrielle Meagher say Australia's childcare regulator has consistently been showing that for-profit childcare services are, on average, rated as lower quality than not-for-profit services.
A parliamentary inquiry has been called into the troubled childcare sector following a landmark ABC investigation into serious safety breaches in the industry.
They say large for-profit providers have a higher proportion of part-time and casual staff than not-for-profits, employ less experienced staff, and pay their staff less.
But despite this, the federal government continues to support for-profit providers through huge childcare subsidies.
""Today, more than 70 per cent of all long day-care centres are operated by private providers. Between 2013 and 2023, the number of for-profit long daycare services jumped by 60 per cent, while not-for-profits only grow by 4 per cent,"" they wrote in The Conversation this week.
The Greens are now calling for a royal commission into the sector, but Prime Minister Anthony Albanese says it's unnecessary.
Professors Fenech and Meagher say a royal commission isn't necessary to tell us ""the current system needs fundamental change"".
Australia's aged care sector has had a different experience with marketisation.
Proper facilities for aged care began to emerge in Australia in the 1950s when hospitals started focusing on acute care and closed their beds for long-term care.
In 1954, the federal government began supporting accommodation for older people by handing capital grants to charities and religious organisations to cover the costs of building homes for the elderly.
If the final report's major recommendations are adopted, Australia will get a transformed aged care system over the next five years. Here are our top four takeaways.
In 1956, the government got involved in community care by providing assistance to home nursing organisations.
But in 1963, the federal government also introduced a direct public subsidy for every occupied bed in nursing homes, and that led to a ""state-subsidised commercial bonanza"" for for-profit providers in the sector.
""The guaranteed payments made nursing homes a risk-free investment and eligible frail older patients became a valuable earning asset,"" researchers Michael Fine and Bob Davidson wrote in 2018.
""While the subsidised market helped keep costs per bed day low, it also resulted in low quality care and systemic distortions, as providers competed to fill empty beds, then to expand by opening more homes to take advantage of the secure government payments.""
In 1986, a review of the system recommended the sector be better regulated, and that government explore alternatives to residential care, including less expensive alternative forms of community-based provision.
""This laid the foundations for Australia's current system with its high proportion of subsidised, largely non-profit community care services and prompted the expansion of the non-profit providers of residential care,"" the researchers wrote.
But fast forward to 2018, and another Four Corners investigation uncovered shocking reports of elder abuse in Australia's aged care facilities, which prompted the Morrison government to announce a royal commission into the sector.
The commission found one in three people who accessed residential aged care and home care services in Australia received substandard care.
Three years after a bruising royal commission exposed substandard care leading to neglect and abuse in nursing homes, elderly Australians may be asked to fork out more money than ever before, writes Anne Connolly.
However, it also found a lack of quality data made it difficult to know how much the extent of substandard care varied across different provider types, including the organisation type — for-profit, not-for-profit, and government.
But in residential aged care, it said government-run providers performed better on average than both for-profit and not-for-profit care providers.
It said surveys also suggested that life satisfaction of elderly residents was highest in government-run services, followed by not-for-profit, and then for-profit services.
The royal commission released its final report in March 2021 and made 148 recommendations.
In response, the Albanese government passed a new Aged Care Act through parliament in 2024, which will come into effect on July 1, 2025. But it only aims to address about 60 recommendations from the royal commission.",ABC News,finance
"Pilbara traditional owners push back on Rio Tinto, state government water extraction from sacred sites",By Charlie McLean,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-22/water-extraction-in-northern-wa-damaging-aboriginal-sites/104626770,"Elaine James shakes her head as she walks on the dry river bed where water ran only months ago.
Holding the red soil in her hands, the Robe River Kuruma woman feels more shame than anger.
""I think to myself I'm failing as a traditional owner in what my responsibility is to the land,"" Ms James said.

Since 2014, mining giant Rio Tinto has taken water from nine bores in the Bungaroo Valley, around 1,400km north of Perth, with state government permission to extract 10 gigalitres (10 billion litres) each year.
It helps supply drinking water to the coastal towns connected to the West Pilbara water scheme.
But it's also used extensively by the region's mining industry, for uses including processing and dust-reduction spraying.
The three pillars of the West Pilbara Water Supply Scheme are the Bungaroo and Millstream borefields, and the Harding Dam near Roebourne. (ABC News: Mark Evans)
Last year, the Robe River Kuruma Aboriginal Corporation (RRKAC) asked hydrologist Ryan Vogwill to take a closer look at how 10 years of water extraction had impacted the Bungaroo ecosystem.
Rio Tinto is required to regularly monitor water levels from the nine bores in the Bungaroo Valley and share this data with the RRKAC.
Mr Vogwill said the numbers revealed a stark decline in groundwater levels.

Data relating to groundwater levels and vegetation health is also regularly reviewed by the Department of Water and Environmental Regulation.
But the department refused to answer questions about what those reviews had uncovered.
It did, however, provide data confirming rainfall levels in the west Pilbara had been below average over the past four years, which the state government said had reduced groundwater recharge across the region.
Data from the WA Department of Water and Environmental Regulation shows rainfall in the Karratha and Millstream regions has been below average in recent years. (ABC News: Mark Evans)
Traditional owners across the Pilbara are noticing similar impacts on sacred waterways.
The level of water being extracted from the Millstream Aquifer, 200km north of the Bungaroo Valley, has prompted Yindjibarndi traditional owners to ask the state's environmental watchdog to intervene.
The state-owned Water Corporation holds the groundwater licence for the aquifer and takes roughly 6 billion litres a year.
The utility has permission to extract an additional 3 billion litres until 2027 if low rainfall levels continue — well over established safe levels for the aquifer.
""[Yindjibarndi people] can see the trees dying, there are no more animals on country,"" community leader Michael Woodley said.
Yindjibarndi leader Michael Woodley says Millstream looked healthier when he was a child. (ABC News: Charlie Mclean)
""Your heart just kind of sinks because we all remember the days when we were young, coming out here with our grandfathers and this place looked a whole lot different.""
A Water Corporation spokesperson said extraction from Millstream had dropped significantly since 2022 when the licence more than halved from 15 billion litres a year to 6 billion litres.
""While groundwater remains an important drinking water source in the West Pilbara, we recognise that, like rainfall, it is being impacted by climate change,"" the spokesperson said.
""Because of this, we are investigating new long-term water source options for the West Pilbara.""
But in the short term, it wants more water from Millstream.
That's because the third pillar of the West Pilbara water supply scheme — the Harding Dam — is filled to just one-third of its 64-billion-litre capacity.
The Yindjibarndi people describe the Millstream Chichester National Park as their ""spiritual heartland"". (ABC News: Charlie Mclean)
The dam's creation in the early 1980s was opposed by the Yindjibarndi people because it blocked off water channels linked to sacred ceremonial sites.
Both Rio Tinto and the state government accept that the current approach to water extraction cannot continue and are looking to pivot to seawater desalination.
""We all recognise the past five years in the Pilbara have been particularly dry,"" Rio Tinto spokesman Richard Cohen said.
Rio Tinto's Richard Cohen accepts there have been environmental impacts on the Bungaroo Valley in recent years. (ABC News: Charlie Mclean)
""And that's had an impact on the environment, there is no doubt about that.""
Construction is underway on a desalination plant near Dampier, north-west of Karratha, which will produce 4 billion litres of water a year.
The Water Corporation has now commenced discussions on stage 2 of the project, which will double the plant's capacity.
Desalination was originally floated back in 2014, but was deemed too expensive with the government favouring the continuing extraction of groundwater instead.
Mr Cohen said Rio Tinto was also open to reducing water use in other parts of the Pilbara.
""There are some great examples elsewhere where we have reduced water [extraction] to ensure the return of some springs and some native vegetation at the request of some traditional owners,"" he said.
Groundwater from the Pilbara's aquifers is used at Rio Tinto's coastal ports to reduce dust. (ABC News: Charlie Mclean)
A separate desalination plant run by the state is also in the pipeline for 2030.
From that point, Rio Tinto believes no more water will be needed from the Bungaroo Valley and significantly less from Millstream.
Robe River Kuruma man Leon Adam said he did not want to wait another five years for water extraction in the Bungaroo Valley to end.
""I don't think I can wait that long because they've done too much damage already,"" he said.
""I see all the changes within the country and within the motions of the old people. And you can hear it in their voice and see it in their body language.""
Robe River Kuruma man Leon Adam says he would prefer water extraction from the Bungaroo Valley to end immediately. (ABC News: Charlie Mclean)
Michael Woodley said it was important that extraction levels in Millstream were reviewed more regularly moving forward, given mining in the Pilbara was not going away any time soon.
""I don't think we can go on the next 50 years drawing water from this place. I don't think it's sustainable,"" he said.

Origin Energy fined $17m for Victorian energy rule breaches,By Madi Chwasta,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-22/victoria-energy-breaches-fine-origin/105084328,"Origin Energy has been ordered to pay $17.6 million after admitting to breaches of Victoria's energy rules that affected nearly 670,000 gas and electricity customers.
In the Supreme Court of Victoria, Origin Energy admitted to not providing adequate ""best offer"" messaging to more than 655,000 customers, and failing to provide adequate support to another 6,800 having payment difficulty.
It also admitted to overcharging 78 customers, recovering undercharged amounts from 411 customers beyond a four-month back-billing limit, and failing to maintain information on 10 customers undergoing life support.
These breaches occurred between December, 2021 and May, 2023.
Origin Energy admitted to and apologised for breaching Victoria's energy rules. (ABC News: Lucas Hill)
In his judgement handed down on Friday, Justice Michael Osborne said Origin admitted it was liable before the proceedings began, but said it was important that the penalty had ""sufficient sting in it"".
Essential Services Commission chairperson and commissioner Gerard Brody said the regulator took Origin to court and pushed for ""significant penalties"" to ""send a message"".
“While today’s decision will be felt most directly by Origin, it will reverberate in the boardrooms of all energy retailers,"" he said.
Gerard Brody said the Essential Services Commission pushed for significant penalties. (ABC News: Billy Draper)
""And the message is simple – compliance with consumer protections requires investment and attention, it cannot be an afterthought.”
“Retailers play a central and proactive role in offering customers support and strong consumer protections – that’s a non-negotiable for every business operating in the Victorian market.”
Origin retail executive general manager Jon Briskin apologised for the breaches.
""We are sorry we didn’t meet our regulatory obligations for these customers, and we are committed to doing better with significant resources dedicated towards improving compliance performance,"" he said.
“We self-reported most of the breaches to the regulator, cooperated fully with their investigations and take full responsibility for all of the breaches before the court.""
The breaches affected electricity and gas customers. (Supplied: Facebook/ Power and Water)
Mr Briskin said many of the breaches were caused by errors in the company's legacy customer service platform or by human error.
""With all of Origin’s retail electricity and gas customers now being serviced through our new customer service platform Kraken, we expect to deliver great service and improved compliance outcomes,"" he said.
“Customers suffered no or limited loss or damage, and we remediated affected customers where appropriate.""
In addition to the fine, the court will order Origin to implement additional quality assurance measures, publish public notices in major Melbourne newspapers, run additional training for staff, and pay court costs for the Essential Services Commission.
Origin Energy does not plan to appeal the orders.
It is believed to be the largest financial penalty for breaches of energy rules in Victorian history.
Origin Energy paid a similar fine ordered by the Federal Court in 2022 after breaching its obligations to customers experiencing hardship and payment difficulties.

Tasmanian salmon companies defend safety of products amid allegations of diseased fish processing,MBy Meg Whitfield,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-22/tasmanian-salmon-companies-defend-safety-of-products/105080464,"Tasmanian salmon companies are insisting their products are safe to eat while not directly answering questions about whether diseased fish are being sold for human consumption.
In recent weeks, a bacterial outbreak has led to the mass deaths of farmed Atlantic salmon from pens in southern Tasmania.
Combined with warmer weather, the bacteria outbreak was behind the deaths of at least 5,500 tonnes of fish dumped at southern Tasmanian waste facilities in February alone, and resulted in oily globules washing up on multiple beaches along the D'Entrecasteaux Channel in Hobart's south.
The Department of Natural Resources and Environment has previously said the bacterium didn't pose a ""human or animal health, or food safety risk"".
Images and videos of dead fish in a pen were shared by the Bob Brown Foundation. (Supplied: Bob Brown Foundation)
Speaking at a press conference on Friday morning, federal Tasmanian independent MP Andrew Wilkie said 2014 documents on operating procedures from Huon Aquaculture have raised questions on whether diseased fish were being sold to consumers.
He said this was combined with a 2017 document, which provided information about company emergency procedures in the event of a significant risk to fish health.
The 2014 document specifies that in any large mortality event, ""as many fish as possible should be recovered for harvest and processing"", and any fish in which ""the gills can still bleed is potentially recoverable"".
""All recoverable fish must be kept separate and placed into an ice slurry ASAP,'"" it reads.
It also says a health production manager will ""determine whether the fish can be sent for processing"".
RSPCA Australia strips its certification from Tasmanian salmon farming giant Huon Aquaculture.
The document also notes that if the mortality ""occurs on a Friday or Saturday then the factory requires a minimum of 2 tonnes of recovered fish to arrange cost-effective processing"".
Huon Aquaculture told the ABC the documents were outdated and produced under the business' prior ownership.
It said the company only harvested live fish for human consumption.
""Everything that hits the shelves is completely safe to eat,"" it said.
Huon Aquaculture did not provide the ABC with its current procedure.
Salmon Tasmania chief executive Luke Martin said the state's industry ""only harvests live fish for human consumption"".
""I don't know how much clearer we can be — the Tasmanian salmon industry only ever processes live fish perfectly suitable for human consumption,"" Mr Martin said.
""Like all good protein farmers, our salmon companies undertake multiple quality control checks throughout the harvesting and processing of their fish.
""These are long-standing processes that have been developed over decades and are routinely audited by federal government food safety authorities.
""The bacterium that has caused this recent mortality event, RLO [Rickettsia-like organisms], is not transferable to humans.
""The Tasmanian Director of Public Health has confirmed that the marine bacterium [Piscirickettsia samonis (P. Salmonis)] is a fish pathogen and does not cause human or terrestrial animal disease, or any food safety risk.""

Q: Do the 2014 operating procedures still apply? If not, what changes have been made? Can you please provide an updated operating procedure that specifies that dead, dying and/or diseased fish are not sent to the market for processing for human consumption.
Q: Is it possible that diseased fish that are still alive, or others that are dead, are recovered for harvest and processing?
Q: Is it possible that diseased fish are sent to market for human consumption?
Q: Even if the diseased fish pose no threat to human health, why should consumers not be advised that the fish are diseased?
Q: How many tonnes of fish have died in the ongoing mass mortality event?
This is the full response received by the ABC:
Huon only harvests live fish for human consumption. Everything that hits the shelves is completely safe to eat.
Processing facilities are subject to extensive mandatory independent auditing by multiple bodies that confirm food safety.
These are outdated, 11-year-old documents that were produced under prior ownership.
Mr Wilkie said the document was cause for serious concern.
""I do not accept that these are historic documents and are no longer valid because they are entirely consistent with what whistleblowers are telling us today,"" Mr Wilkie said.
Federal Labor will push through legislation next week which could derail a legal battle over salmon farming's impact on an endangered ray and safeguard the industry's future in Tasmania.
He said an independent inquiry was needed in the wake of this information and the recent mortality events.
Peter George, an independent Franklin candidate, and a founder of anti-salmon group Neighbours of Fish Farming, said consumers had a right to know if they were consuming diseased fish.
""This industry has been shown to have no social licence whatsoever,"" he said.
""It's quite clear that this industry is on the nose, should get out of the water, and that's what we've been warning for the past 10 years.""

Government MP Kerry Vincent said the salmon industry was ""heavily regulated"" and that he had ""the greatest confidence"" the sector would work through the current challenges it was facing.
""With a market that's so heavily regulated, everybody's looking at it, everybody's reporting on it. I don't think there's any opportunity for lack of transparency.""
Oliver Jones, a chemistry professor at RMIT University, said the bacterium impacting salmon pens in Tasmania, Piscirickettsia salmonis, was ""non-pathogenic to humans"".
""There's no evidence that it causes disease in humans,"" Professor Jones said.
""It's quite nasty in fish, but in humans it doesn't seem to have any effect.""
Professor Oliver Jones says there's no evidence the bacterium causes disease in humans. (ABC Melbourne: Billy Draper)
Professor Jones said he could understand the concern from the community, but that his message was simple.
""Don't panic,"" he said.
While the federal election hasn't yet been called, the salmon industry has already taken a strong focus in Tasmania, with both major parties backing in the sector.
Next week, the federal government is set to introduce amendments to the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act to ensure the future of salmon farming in Macquarie Harbour on the state's west coast.
The industry in Macquarie Harbour has been under a cloud since November 2023, after three conservation groups requested federal Environment Minister Tanya Plibersek review whether the industry has the necessary approvals under the EPBC Act.
Ms Plibersek is still considering the request and has not provided a time frame for her decision.
On Friday, Opposition Leader Peter Dutton confirmed the legislation will have his party's support — meaning it will pass through parliament, despite strident opposition by the Greens.

Plummeting gas demand averts looming gas crisis as AEMO dials down warning,Daniel Mercer,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-20/plummeting-gas-demand-averts-looming-gas-crisis/105072412,"Gas consumption in Australia is falling faster than anticipated, helping to avoid the risks of seasonal shortages in the next few years, according to energy commentators.
In its latest outlook for the east coast gas market, the Australian Energy Market Operator dialled down its warnings that shortfalls of the fuel could emerge as early as this year.
But the AEMO said the longer-term risks to gas supply remained serious as output from the Bass Strait — the bedrock of the industry in southern states led by Victoria — dramatically declined from 2028.
The latest forecasts by the AEMO are a marked shift from last year when the agency warned that ""peak-day shortfalls"" may start to plague the market as soon as this winter.
According to the latest outlook, to be released today, the immediate threat of shortages had passed as the supply situation had improved.
The AEMO noted that part of the improvement came from the decision of the New South Wales government to extend the life of the giant Eraring coal-fired power plant.
It also noted there had been a significant fall in demand for gas.
Mild winter temperatures, which reduced the consumption of gas for heating among households, were one explanation.

More importantly, however, the AEMO said that higher prices were also having an effect, dampening demand not only from residential customers but commercial and industrial users as well.
Similarly, the market operator suggested that electrification — the switching from gas to electricity for energy needs — was also starting to bite into demand.
""Forecast gas consumption for commercial, residential and industrial users declines over the outlook period to 2044,"" the AEMO noted in its outlook.
""Industrial consumption has declined in recent years, with plant disruptions affecting gas consumption, and several facilities have closed or are expecting to close in the short term.
""Residential and small commercial consumption is also forecast to slightly decline in the short term, with more significant levels of electrification in the medium to longer term, in line with a transition to net zero emissions goals.""
Analysts said the revised forecasts were evidence the move towards electrification was gaining traction.
Joshua Runciman, lead gas analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA), said it showed the push was ""paying off"".
Analysis by international think tank InfluenceMap has looked at how the gas industry has pushed back against efforts in Victoria to transition away from gas as part of a global campaign to keep households hooked on the fuel.
Mr Runciman said household and commercial demand for gas in Victoria, for example, had fallen five per cent in the past year.
He said the trend undermined the claim that new gas supplies were badly needed.
""While some of this fall reflects milder winter weather reducing heating load, it also reflects electrification and declining demand due to high gas prices,"" Mr Runciman said.
""Falling residential and commercial demand is also helping to free up gas for major industrial users, helping to keep manufacturing jobs in Australia.
Despite its improved outlook for the next three years, the AEMO has stood by its previous warnings that a structural deficit in gas supply is due to emerge from 2028.
AEMO chief executive Daniel Westerman said even though demand was falling, supply would tail away at a faster rate once production in the Bass Strait fell off a cliff later this decade.
Central to this risk was the gradual closure of the Longford gas plant in Victoria, which he said had ""historically supplied two-thirds of the gas used"" on the east coast.
Longford, which has been in service since 1969, is the biggest source of gas to Australia's southern states of Victoria, South Australia, New South Wales and Tasmania.
In Victoria, Longford helped underpin the development of the state's modern manufacturing economy.
However, it is scheduled to wind down in the coming years as the reserves of gas in the Bass Strait are depleted.

""Production is falling faster than demand in the southern states, reinforcing the need for investment in new gas supply,"" Mr Westerman said.
Unless more gas supplies were brought on stream, Mr Westerman said the spectre of peak-day shortfalls would become a feature of the market from 2029.
He said there were a number of different possible solutions, from new development of new gas fields to upgrades to storage and transportation.
On top of this, he said there was also the prospect of imported liquefied natural gas, or LNG.

Regardless of the options taken, the AEMO boss said gas would be vital to the energy transition, backing up renewable energy and batteries as coal left the system.
Australia is one of the world's biggest gas exporters, but we're about to start importing it from overseas.
""Flexible gas-powered generation will remain the ultimate backstop in a high-renewable power system,"" he said.
""Gas, alongside batteries and pumped hydro, will enable higher renewable penetration and support reliability as coal-fired power stations retire.""
Beyond 2030, the AEMO forecasts that gas will play an essential part in keeping the lights on.
It said gas would be the so-called firming fuel used to produce electricity when there was low or no wind and solar output for extended periods.
Not everyone agreed with the suggestion that more gas supplies are needed.
The IEEFA's Kevin Morrison said the AEMO had consistently forecast that gas demand would be higher than turned out to be the case.
He said the latest forecast was unlikely to be any different despite the evidence demand was plummeting amid the rise of renewable energy.
To bolster his point, he said the amount of gas used to generate electricity had declined 60 per cent in the past 11 years even as coal-fired generators closed.
Gas demand among residential and commercial users, he said, had fallen 13 per cent in the past two years alone.
Households are once again bracing for another round of power bill hikes. But for a nation that is one of the world's biggest energy exporters, it's a situation that defies logic and reeks of an epic policy failure.
""AEMO has perennially warned of gas shortages in eastern Australia, which sends 80 per cent of its gas output overseas and has caused prices to rise,"" Mr Morrison said.
""This has prompted users to either switch to cheaper low emissions alternatives or it has forced the closure of manufacturing plants.
""This combination has caused overall gas consumption to fall.
""As a result, we are now seeing AEMO deferring the timing of these expected shortages, now they are not going to occur until 2028, three years later than what was forecast in last year's (outlook) as less gas is used domestically, but we are still seeing more exported.""",ABC News,finance
Behind America's decades-long fight to dismantle the PBS,Ian Verrender,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-21/behind-americas-decades-long-fight-to-dismantle-the-pbs/105078864,"For decades, America's pharmaceutical giants have been plotting to torpedo Australia's Pharmaceuticals Benefits Scheme (PBS).
Twenty years ago, they scored a huge victory when they secured major concessions from the Howard government, as America and Australia negotiated the Australia-US Free Trade Agreement.
Big pharma was at it again during the Obama years when Australia was on the cusp of signing up to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP).
A multilateral trade deal, the TPP was designed to build a regional bloc against China.
Buried in the detail, however, were clauses that quietly entrenched the power of major American corporations.
A naive Donald Trump scuppered that deal in his first term, purely because it was an Obama initiative.
With Trump again in the White House, this time threatening a global trade war, America's pharmaceutical industry lobbyists, having made huge donations to his campaign, have seized upon a golden opportunity.
Australians have enjoyed some of the cheapest medicines in the developed world, thanks to the PBS.
It's a situation that has long irked the pharma industry, which has courted American politicians and parlayed its huge profits into a well-oiled influence-peddling machine.
But forget all the noise from the pharmaceutical giants about federal government subsidies that for decades have delivered affordable medicines to Australians — the real issue is power.
We answer your questions about the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, what drugs are eligible, and how you can get cheaper medication.
In most other nations, the titans of the medicine supply industry rule supreme over their customers by virtue of their size and dominance, exploiting the imbalance.
Here, however, thanks to a referendum voted upon by Australians in 1946, those same big companies have met their match.
Here, they are forced to negotiate with just one, big, powerful buyer — the federal government.
Here, they are forced to deal with medical specialists who delve into their pricing, and question the sometimes huge price discrepancies between almost identical medicines.
If big pharma can unwind Australia's control of the medicines market, they will be able to train their sights on other markets like Canada, the UK and Europe, which similarly provide health benefits to their citizens.
America's well-oiled pharma lobbying machine doesn't mince words when it comes to Australia.
In a submission to the US government, it describes the PBS as one of the most ""egregious and discriminatory"" pricing regimes that actively limits prices and earnings.
Calling on the US government to impose punishing tariffs, it claims the scheme ""undermines American competitiveness, jobs and exports"".
That's something of an overreach.
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Opposition Leader Peter Dutton say the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, a cornerstone of Australia's health system, will never be a negotiating chip in US President Donald Trump's ongoing tariff campaign.
In 2004, when the Free Trade Agreement was being negotiated, then-health minister Tony Abbott was adamant that the proposed changes to the scheme would not impact the cost of medicines.
To an extent, that was correct — but only because taxpayers were forced to pick up the tab.
Ironically, a decade later during his first year as prime minister, Abbott and then-treasurer Joe Hockey brought down a tough budget, largely because of a blow-out in the cost of the PBS.
Prior to the Free Trade Agreement, Australia's PBS negotiators employed a tactic known as ""reference pricing"".
Single-branded, patented drugs (which usually deliver far bigger profits) were compared in terms of pricing and effectiveness with non-patented medications.
It helped contain prices for the best and latest medications.
The 2005 FTA all but outlawed ""reference pricing"".
Instead, two categories of medications were created — one was F1, patented drugs, and the other was F2, lower-cost generic drugs.
While reference pricing, or comparisons, can be employed within the patented category, F1 drugs can't be referenced against much cheaper generics.
And generic manufacturers using the same active ingredient as an F1 drug wishing to enter the Australian market, must warn the patent owner.
What usually happens next is that the patent owner applies to the Federal Court for an injunction, resulting in several years of costly delays, which prejudices generic manufacturers.
As a result, generic drugs have become barely profitable and are now generally manufactured offshore in countries such as India, at huge production levels in order to break even.
One side-effect of this mass-scale production is that a bad batch, or any other problem or outage, often results in mass shortages of generic drugs.
Another gripe from the American pharma giants is that Australia delays the introduction of new medications, as the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee deliberates over their effectiveness.
This delay, the US pharma lobby group complains, amounts to a non-tariff barrier and a restriction on trade.
Ironically, some American health officials opposed the changes imposed upon Australia during the free trade negotiations 20 years ago — and were pushing for a similar scheme to the PBS to be implemented in the US.
For a nation at the forefront of medical innovation and drug manufacture, vast numbers of Americans simply can't afford to access to vital medicines.",ABC News,finance
"Trade wars, strongmen, and economic chaos. This is a critical moment for Australia",Gareth Hutchens,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-16/trade-wars-strongmen-economic-chaos-australia-seen-this-before/105051420,"History doesn't repeat, it rhymes.
In April last year, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese delivered a landmark speech about our economy.
It was the speech in which he made a case for his ""Future Made in Australia"" plan and explained his ambition to turn Australia into a renewable energy superpower.
""This decade marks a fundamental shift in the way nations are structuring their economies,"" he said.
The US president often says ""tariff"" is his favourite word in the dictionary. Australia is about to feel the effects of Donald Trump's love for the protectionist trade tool.
""Nations are drawing an explicit link between economic security and national security. The so-called 'Washington consensus' has fractured and Washington itself is pursuing a new direction.
""All these countries are investing in their industrial base, their manufacturing capability and their economic sovereignty.
""This is not old-fashioned protectionism or isolationism — it is the new competition,"" he said.
It was a notable speech because of what it signified.
It was further evidence that the world was changing rapidly. The old playbook was disintegrating. Countries were consciously trying to re-shape their economies and re-imagine their futures, and Australia was joining them.
And it was happening in a febrile geopolitical environment in which democracy was in retreat and populism and authoritarianism were on the rise globally, and millions of people were losing faith in politics-as-usual and 21st-century globalisation.
When Mr Albanese gave that speech, I pointed out some historical parallels with a lecture John Maynard Keynes had given in Dublin in April 1933 titled National Self-Sufficiency.
I thought the parallels were fascinating.
When Keynes delivered that lecture, the Great Depression was in full swing and Europeans were losing faith in laissez-faire capitalism and the remnants of 19th-century globalisation.
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese says we must think differently about the role of government, when strategic competition has become a fact of life. But what role should government play in our future economic development?
Adolf Hitler had been appointed chancellor of Germany four months earlier, Benito Mussolini had been in power for a decade in Italy, and Joseph Stalin had long-ago cemented his grip on Russia.
An increasing number of countries were leaning towards nationalism, economic self-sufficiency, and economic experimentation.
What path should democratic societies take in the new world order where old certainties and economic relationships were breaking down and strongmen were rising to power?
Keynes said no-one knew where things were headed but countries had a right to restructure their economies to fit their new ambitions and rapidly changing situations.
""We are, all of us, I expect, about to make many mistakes. No-one can tell which of the new systems will prove itself best,"" he said.
""But the point of my present discussion is this. We each have our own fancy. Not believing that we are saved already, we each would like to have a try at working out our own salvation.""
Why should anyone care about a lecture from an economist in 1933? Anybody who reads history can identify patterns, and this one appeared obvious.
Fast forward to today.
Last week, economists and researchers at UNSW and the e61 think tank released a report that made observations about today's situation that, once again, brought that 1933 lecture to mind.
The report was titled: The rising isolation of an island nation: Five economic themes that will dominate the next parliament.
It warned the global trend towards populism in recent years, the re-election of Donald Trump in the United States, and the breakdown of the global trading system would be very challenging for Australia.
As the geopolitical landscape quickly shifts, a new report says Australia faces major economic challenges.
""Many nations are abandoning open trade and climate action. Others will pursue one or both, but outside any multilateral, rules-based structure.
""Many are pursuing industrial policy in the name of resilience, self-sufficiency or sovereign capability.
""This is not a temporary blip. A rules-based order relies on credible long-term commitment. The ripple effects of recent, dramatic US policy changes are far-reaching and cannot be easily reversed. There is no return to normal.
""The risk to Australia is stark,"" it said.
The report's authors made it clear that, when it came to climate change, they thought the re-election of Mr Trump had changed the game dramatically, given his hostility towards climate action and international agreements.
They said climate change remained an urgent challenge, but Australia's plan to become a green energy superpower now faced ""hurdles"".
""It relies on foreign demand for green products, including energy-intensive value-added goods produced in Australia,"" it said.
""With global commitment to emissions reduction now less clear, and economies pursuing tariffs, industrial policy and on-shoring, Australia's ability to export low-cost renewable power is in question.
""Australia must respond to this new dynamic. While many nations have responded by protecting and building up their domestic manufacturing capabilities, Australia should take a different approach,"" it said.
The report said Australia could find economic opportunities in the shift to ""friendshoring"" — trading with trusted partners — as countries realigned their trading and geopolitical relationships in response to the chaos.
It warned ""protectionist and industrial policies"" in Australia would not build the agility we need in an increasingly unpredictable world.
""Policymakers should look to build greater economic flexibility to rapidly respond to new opportunities,"" it said.
""As the Treasury Secretary highlighted recently, trade-exposed firms need to be flexible in switching their imports and exports to other countries as needed.""
Coincidently, in November, the director of the Superpower Institute, Ross Garnaut, also warned that Mr Trump's re-election was a blow to Australia on climate and trade.
But recently, he said the business and climate case for renewables still left Australia in the box seat to capitalise, even though political events were making things more difficult.
""The election of Trump doesn't change the physics [of climate change] one bit,"" Professor Garnaut said last month.
Professor Ross Garnaut says Australia's economy experienced a ""lost decade"" from 2013 to 2023. Can these ideas turn things around, asks Gareth Hutchens.
""Atmospheric physics doesn't care who wins American elections or what commentators are saying on Fox News.
""China sees a geopolitical opportunity in America's withdrawal from Paris. It's already actively promoting its own decarbonisation … It will use its industrial strength to enhance cooperation with other countries wanting to move to net zero.
""But if the US developments become instrumental in changing political direction in the rest of the world, then that will have a big negative effect on the world's action on climate change,"" he said.
However, always the optimist, Professor Garnaut said renewable energy had a life of its own these days because it's now the cheapest form of energy, so it will continue to drive many business decisions.
""If we get it right, we've got the lowest cost renewable energy of any large country,"" he said of Australia's plans.
""And that could be the basis of strong competitiveness in a wide range of industries that use a lot of energy. Most of these — and the jobs in them — are based in rural and provincial Australia.
""In fact, the economic growth in the next half century in Australia will be disproportionately in rural and provincial areas because that's where the zero-carbon industrial growth will be,"" he said.
The geopolitics are extremely fluid. And we are all, one suspects, about to make many mistakes.",ABC News,finance
"'Limited incentive' for Coles and Woolworths to compete vigorously on price, and margins have risen, ACCC finds",Emilia Terzon,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-20/woolworths-coles-accc-supermarkets-inquiry/105077616,"Coles and Woolworths have so much power that they don't need to compete hard on price, an inquiry into the supermarket sector has concluded.
The Australian Competition & Consumer Commission (ACCC) found both supermarket giants have increased their earnings margins in recent years, with a more significant increase at Woolworths.
But the regulator stopped short of concluding that grocery prices were ""excessive"", and did not declare that the two major players in the sector have a duopoly.
That's despite finding Australia's supermarkets are some of the most profitable in the world.
The federal government directed the ACCC to investigate the supermarket sector, amid allegations of price gouging during the pandemic.
Woolworths, Coles, IGA-supplier Metcash and Aldi appeared before hearings last year, alongside some of their suppliers.
Despite not declaring Australia's market a duopoly, the ACCC reiterated concerns that there is far less competition here than overseas, with very few major players, making the sector oligopolistic.
""Coles and Woolworths have limited incentive to compete vigorously with each other on price,"" the report found.
""We have not observed Coles and Woolworths seeking to substantially discount prices below each other in aggregate.""
Woolworths and Coles were found to have enough power to affect the market price of products from some suppliers.
Claims from both supermarkets, that they are facing a lot of competition from retailers as diverse as Bunnings and Amazon don't stack up, the ACCC found.
German supermarket Aldi is providing a bit of extra competition, the watchdog found, but Metcash's impact is limited.
Metcash sells groceries wholesale to independent supermarkets like IGA.
It is the only one of the four companies that hasn't been increasing margins, according to the ACCC's analysis of pricing data supplied by these companies for its inquiry.
The watchdog scrutinised margins on items from pet food and bananas.
Average product margins, concluded by the ACCC (Supplied: ACCC)
Margins on products are different to final profits, the ACCC noted, and there has been substantial cost pressures on these companies' business models too.
Despite that, the supermarkets remain winners.
""While input and operational costs have increased over this time, Coles and Woolworths have maintained or increased their product margins,"" the report found.
Woolworths and Coles are emphasising the threat of Aldi — is it really a competitive force to be reckoned with?
The ACCC calculated the earnings margins of the supermarkets by dividing the companies' earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) by the revenue they generate.
Even when the supermarkets acted to reduce their costs, ""they have not passed on to consumers the full benefit of savings from those initiatives,"" the ACCC concluded.
""Increasing product margins appear to have contributed to the increasing EBIT margins.""
The lift in margins was more stark on branded products that could be stocked across multiple retailers, compared to home brand goods.
""Coles and Woolworths earned higher average product margins on branded products than private label products over the last five financial years.
About a quarter of what Coles and Woolworths sell is now home brand, according to the report, while at Metcash-affiliated stores, it is much lower.
Aldi almost exclusively sells home brands.
The regulator described Aldi as a ""hard discounter"" and a ""crucial lower-priced alternative"" to the two major supermarkets. (ABC News: Sarah Maunder)
Woolworths is making higher margins at its smaller-format metro stores, the ACCC found. It didn't find this about Coles smaller city format, however.
Shoppers are also confused by the supermarkets' loyalty programs and pricing labels, with the ACCC dubbing them ""ambiguous and confusing"".
The ACCC is separately taking ColesWorth to court for allegedly promoting fake discounts on goods but the legal action could not be mentioned at the inquiry.
Suppliers are under the two major supermarkets' thumb, especially those supplying fresh produce like fruit and vegetables, the watchdog found.
It raised concerns that suppliers face a 'monopsony', where there is effectively only one buyer for their products.
""Coles and Woolworths are able to exercise monopsony power in their trading relationships with many suppliers in these supply chains,"" the ACCC found.
The ACCC says fresh produce suppliers are particularly affected by market concentration. (Gary Rivett: ABC News)
Last year's inquiry heard that some suppliers have been offered blanket contracts, that don't include terms such as price or quantity.
Suppliers can also face costs such as freight and promotional charges, as well as ""rebates"" or enforced discounts on their bills when retailers make orders.
""Many suppliers say they fear retribution from raising concerns with supermarkets,"" the ACCC notes.
The ACCC made 20 recommendations for change.
These include making pricing data public, more scrutiny of discounting claims, and a review of Coles and Woolworths' loyalty programs in three years time.
It also wants greater oversight of the rebates that suppliers are paying, and more support of community supermarkets, such as co-operatives.
The ACCC said it had been unable to stack up claims that the big two were sitting on parcels of land to keep out competition, known as landbanking.
Yet it noted stronger powers that it will soon receive to scrutinise acquisitions, known as merger powers.
Complex state planning laws and allegations that Woolworths and Coles are hoarding blocks of land to keep competitors out are facing further scrutiny from the ACCC as it investigates the country's concentrated supermarket sector.
The federal government welcomed the report but did not commit to actioning the recommendations, saying it ""agreed in principle"" and they ""will be considered as part of our existing work"".
The government previously granted the ACCC an extra $30 million over 3.5 years to investigate and take enforcement action on the supermarket and retail sector.
As it released this final report on Thursday, the Labor government said it would commit $2.9 million over three years in next week's budget to help suppliers.
This would be cash ""to help suppliers stand up to the big supermarkets"", the government said.
The National Farmers' Federation said farmers want a fair deal and greater transparency, and it wasn't clear if the recommendations would achieve that.
""Out of those 20 recommendations, there's still in our eyes more to be done and we recognise that the government supports it in principle, but until these are enacted on, they're just words,"" president David Jochinke told Radio National Breakfast.
The government said the ACCC's report did not support breaking up the big supermarkets, known as divestiture powers.
The major supermarkets responded by arguing the Australian grocery market is highly competitive, despite the report's findings of an oligopoly.
""Our experience, in our store and online is that the Australian grocery sector is very competitive,"" Woolworths chief executive Amanda Bardwell said.
""Our customers have greater choice than ever before and are cross-shopping between different retailers more often. If we don't get it right for customers, they shop elsewhere.""
Woolworths said it supported recommendations to improve transparency for buyers and suppliers, and would review the report.
Coles similarly said it would review the recommendations and supported better transparency but cautioned ""against measures that will increase red tape and drive up costs"".
It argued the sector is ""highly competitive and rapidly evolving"", saying it faced competition from Woolworths and IGA, multinational players like Aldi, Costco and Amazon, and thousands of specialty retailers and major chains.
""Customers are increasingly cross-shopping and splitting their grocery spend across a range of retailers – both in store and online – which means Coles must compete vigorously for a share of consumers' grocery baskets.""
Aldi Australia chief executive Anna McGrath said the report confirmed its role in providing ""great quality products at everyday low prices"" but did not comment on any of the recommendations.""
""We support the ACCC in its view that despite the progress independents have made on better prices, there are other significant barriers for independent retailers to compete with the major chains,"" IGA supplier Metcash said.
Metcash said it would like to see more government action on land banking and acquisitions of independent grocers.",ABC News,finance
Real estate agents discouraging long-term leases labelled 'culpable' in state's housing crisis,Eden Hynninen,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-21/real-estate-agents-called-culpable-in-state-housing-crisis/105077654,"A Victorian property investor says real estate agents are ""culpable"" in the state's housing crisis and has called for their tactics to be scrutinised.
This week, the Real Estate Institute of Victoria (REIV) proposed property tax reforms to the government to help alleviate land tax pressures on rental providers offering long-term leases.
Land taxes have been on the rise and some real estate agents claim landlords are looking for ways to make up the $2,000 bill from their tenants.
In Australia, lease agreements are often between six months and two years.
REIV has suggested a 10 per cent land tax discount for a three-year lease, 20 per cent for a five-year lease, and 45 per cent for a 10-year lease.
The move would seek to retain properties that are slipping out of the rental market.
A new report finds Australians need a six-figure salary to comfortably afford the national weekly asking rent for a typical unit.
Landlord Jenny from Wangaratta, in the state's north, said although it was a reasonable proposal, real estate agents needed to be part of the discussion.
""I think they actively discourage long-term leases, so we actually moved our former rental property from one agent to another.
""They blatantly refused to help us do a two-year lease for our great tenants.""
Jenny said she wanted to keep the rent low and encourage the tenants to stay, but felt the real estate agents opposed a longer lease as it would affect the amount of money they could earn on commission.
""I actually said to the real estate agent that 'I will drop the rent by so many dollars per week to keep the good tenants', but they didn't like that,"" she said.
That fee could be more than $400 and rent could be increased when the lease agreement ended.
""Why is this absent from the whole conversation?"" Jenny said.
One landlord says an agent discouraged a long-term lease because they would miss out on a re-signing fee of $400. (ABC Ballarat: Rhiannon Stevens)
Scott Petrie from Trevor Petrie Real Estate in Ballarat said he was happy to provide two-year leases to established tenants.
""If the landlord is happy with how the property is being looked after, we're happy to give a two-year lease,"" Mr Petrie said.
But he said any longer than that might cause problems.
""And it's hard to know what the owner or tenant may want in 10 years' time … They may have to move town, they may need a new property.
""I probably wouldn't want to see longer than two or three years, personally.""
In Ballarat, landlord Emma said she would happily extend her tenant's lease if it meant her land tax bill was reduced.
""The government have just made it so hard for us to keep it,"" Emma said.
""We don't ideally want to sell, but our land went up over a $1,000 in a year, it's just been insane.
""We've never wanted to put up our tenant's rent, but we've had to put it up twice.
Three leading minds in the Australian housing sector give their solutions to nation's rental affordability problem.
REIV chief executive Kelly Ryan said it was common to offer five, 10, 15, or even 20-year leases in some European countries.
""We've also taken learnings closer to home in the commercial space, you take [leases] out for extended periods of time, and within that you also take on reasonability as the renter for some of the basic maintenance,"" Mr Ryan said.
""So if a tap needs to be fixed or a light is broken, you would actually assume some of those responsibilities yourself … it hopefully gives the renter a bit more ownership over their home.

Ben & Jerry's claim CEO sacked by Unilever over social activism,Ben and Jerry's history of activism as it accuses parent company of silencing it on Gaza,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-20/ben-and-jerrys-claims-ceo-sacked-because-of-social-activism/105075594,"Since 1978, ice cream makers Ben & Jerry's have famously pushed for social change.
But in recent years, the US manufacturer has engaged in bitter clashes with parent company Unilever, claiming it is being silenced by the consumer giant over its stance on Gaza.
This week, Ben & Jerry's returned to court, this time claiming Unilever unlawfully removed its chief executive in retaliation over the company's social and political activism.
So how did we get here?
Ben & Jerry's have been locked in a bitter dispute with their parent company. (Reuters: Hannah McKay)
Ben & Jerry's, founded by Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield, was bought by UK consumer goods group Unilever in 2000.
It has once again clashed with its parent company Unilever over its stance on Gaza, leading to a lawsuit alleging Unilever has silenced efforts to express support for Palestinian refugees.
At the time, the Vermont-based company heralded the new partnership as an opportunity to expand its social mission.
But the relationship soured in 2021 when the organisation announced it would stop selling ice cream in the Israeli-occupied West Bank because it was not consistent with the company's values.
The organisation then sued Unilever for selling its business in Israel to its licensee there, allowing marketing in the West Bank and Israel to continue.
The lawsuit was settled in 2022.
But in November last year, Ben & Jerry's launched a new legal action against Unilever, accusing it of silencing its support of Palestinian refugees in the Gaza war.
This latest filing is an amendment to November's lawsuit.
It says Unilever informed the Ben and Jerry's board on March 3 that it was ""removing and replacing"" chief executive David Stever without the required approval from its board.
The manufacturer claimed this came after Unilever repeatedly threatened Ben and Jerry's personnel over non-compliance with the parent company's ""efforts to silence the social mission"".
The ice cream makers said this violated their 2000 merger agreement.

Unilever has since fired back, seeking a dismissal of Ben & Jerry's earlier complaint.
It also claimed the ice cream maker's social mission had evolved into advocacy for ""one-sided, highly controversial, and polarising topics that put Unilever, Ben & Jerry's, and their employees at risk"".
According to Unilever, Ben & Jerry's chair Anuradha Mittal started driving this change in 2021, when the company decided to stop selling ice cream in the West Bank.
Unilever's filing did not address Mr Stever's job or the proposed amended complaint.
In a statement, the parent company said it had repeatedly attempted to engage the Ben & Jerry's board and follow the correct process.
Ben & Jerry's has campaigned for multiple social issues. (Reuters: Brian Snyder)
Ben & Jerry's has a long history of campaigning on social issues, including racial justice, abortion rights, LGBTQIA+ issues and climate change.
Last month, in another court filing, the ice cream maker accused Unilever of banning it from publicly criticising US president Donald Trump.
In its latest filing, Unilever said it offered to work with Ben & Jerry's board on a statement ""focused on substantive issues without personal attacks on President Trump"".
However, it claimed the board refused its ""reasonable and prudent calls for balance"".
Ben & Jerry's activism has also crossed oceans, with the company refusing in 2017 to serve Australian customers a double scoop of the same ice cream flavour until same-sex marriage was legalised.
In 2023, the ice cream giant also announced their support for a Yes vote at the Voice referendum.

Trump's America is abandoning climate action and the fight just got harder,Clinging to hope and culture on a sinking island,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-17/climate-change-religion-trump-zeldin-epa-wind-back-rules/105057538,"While markets and media were chasing Donald Trump’s tariff fiasco last week, something far more important happened in East Palestine, Ohio.
The new head of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Lee Zeldin, chose the fire station in that tiny village between Pittsburgh and Cleveland to announce that he was ""driving a dagger through the heart of climate change religion"", as he put it.
Zeldin is rolling back 31 environmental rules (Make America Dirty Again?) including the EPA’s 2009 finding that greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare, which has been the legal basis for all US action against climate change.
In short, Trump’s America is abandoning climate action.
The new head of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Lee Zeldin, has portrayed concern over climate change as a ""religion"" and overturned the EPA’s 2009 finding that greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare. (AP: John Minchillo)
Meanwhile in Brazil, the government is clearing a swathe of the Amazon rainforest for a road to get 50,000 delegates to the next UN climate change conference – COP30 – to held, weirdly, in the remote city of Belem in November.
Bulldozing the Amazon rainforest is a fitting way to mark 30 years of failure, of annual gabfests that have released colossal amounts of carbon dioxide from the mouths of the well-meaning, and burned tonnes of aviation fuel to get them there, while reducing greenhouse gas emissions not one bit.
In those three decades, human use of fossil fuels has increased 54 per cent.
The withdrawal of America, and the influence that will have on other countries and companies, means the COP30 delegates might as well stay home this year.
The global effort to prevent climate change which began with COP1 in Berlin in 1995 and peaked two years later with a burst of optimism in Kyoto, is pretty much over; it’s dead.
There are two other reasons for this:
Energy scientist, Vaclav Smil puts the total cost of achieving net zero by 2050 at $US444 trillion, or $US17 trillion a year for 25 years, “requiring affluent economies to spend 20 to 25 per cent of their annual GDP on the transition”.
Torres Strait Islanders on the front line of climate change are fighting a landmark lawsuit to save their vanishing ancestral homes. But is it too late?
Only once before in history has that much money been spent – in World War 2. This time the spending would have to last three decades, not five years, and no country is contemplating anything like that.
So net zero by 2050 won’t happen and the increase in global temperature will not be limited to the 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels that was agreed as preferred at Paris in 2015 – nowhere near it.
Current policies and pledges put the world on track for around 2.5–3°C of warming, but if emissions remain high and predicted tipping points are reached, 4°C is likely later this century.
At that point, scientists tell us, large parts of the planet be will uninhabitable, and the parts that aren’t uninhabitable will be more unpleasant and dangerous.
Before we get on to what 3–4°C of warming means for Australia, it’s worth reflecting on why this has happened. Why has 30 years of talking and earnest good intentions failed to prevent global warming?
Global emissions look to rise for yet another year, a new Carbon Budget report reveals. Climate scientists are frustrated because the world has the technology to change that.
Obviously, a big part of it is the fossil fuel industry’s success in turning climate change into a political issue instead of a scientific one, persuading the right side of politics that it’s all part of a left woke conspiracy, even a “religion”, with the right-wing media facilitating that project, led by Rupert Murdoch.
But I think the more fundamental reason is the scientific community’s failure to tell the truth.
There has been systemic reticence on the part of scientists to spell out what’s actually going on, first because science is inherently uncertain, so they are always reluctant to be definitive, and second because they worry that if the true nightmare was revealed, politicians and everybody else would either refuse to believe it or just give up.
So science says 1.5°C of warming and avoiding the extremes of climate change are achievable, and the way politics and media work, that is taken to mean it will be achieved, no problem.
In fact it is now very unlikely, and Australia should do what France is doing and refocus on adapting to reality.
On the same day that Lee Zeldin was stabbing climate change religion to death with his dagger, the French minister for “ecological transition”, Agnes Pannier-Runacher released a 377-page report titled Le Plan National d’Adaptation, designed to prepare France for 4°C of warming. Four degrees!
My French is limited, but the plan looks quite inadequate for the catastrophe that sort of rise in global temperature would bring. At least they are thinking about it.
As global temperatures climb, climate scientists say some of the things that made Tropical Cyclone Alfred unique could be a taste of the future.
For Australia, warming of 3-4°C would see the complete destruction of the Great Barrier Reef, constant flooding of south-east Queensland and northern NSW, cyclones as far south as Coffs Harbour, frequent bushfires everywhere else, and a massive refugee flood as Bangladesh and Pacific Islands are inundated.
Apart from the refugees, preparing for that risk is largely a matter of infrastructure and insurance – in other words, money.
About 25 per cent of Queensland households are currently uninsured, according to the Actuaries Institute. As premiums rise, that number will increase.
In south-east Queensland, 70 per cent of houses were built before the 1970s. All of them are in Region B of the National Construction Code (NCC), which means they are not built to withstand a category 2 cyclone.
If Cyclone Alfred had not become a tropical low before hitting the Queensland coast, and had stayed Category 2, many thousands of families would have been financially ruined. Their uninsured houses would have lost their roofs or collapsed.
The next cyclone, or the one after that, will likely remain as Category 2.
Separately, almost all households in Australia are underinsured because of the roughly 40-50 per cent rise in building costs since the pandemic, which is reflected in very few replacement sums in insurance policies.
As Cyclone Alfred was peaking in the Coral Sea in late February, the Insurance Council of Australia released a new report titled Advancing Australia’s Resilience, directed at influencing policies for the coming federal election and reducing the cost of insurance.
It recommended $30 billion of spending on infrastructure, as follows:
The ICA is talking mainly about floods, which it says is the second biggest component of insurance premiums (tax is the biggest – GST and stamp duty).
President Donald Trump has wasted no time dismantling climate policies and promising a new era of fossil-fuel dominance and withdrawing the US from the Paris Agreement.
The $30 billion would be spent building levies along river banks and around towns, raising houses onto stilts and simply helping families move out of flood plains by buying their unsaleable properties – that is, reducing risk and thereby lowering premiums and get more houses insured.
Needless to say, the government has filed the report under 'M' for maybe later, with a copy under 'V' for vested interest.
But the reality is that without that kind of spending, and probably much more, it will be impossible to live in much of regional Australia, and the cities are already over-crowded.
That is, of course, unless it’s all a new green woke scam religion.
Let’s hope so.

Port Adelaide stood incredibly tall in Travis Boak's milestone game, defeating a young Richmond outfit by a whopping 72 points.
The veteran broke the club record for most games in the Power colours with 393 outings, which really is a huge achievement.
The Power bounced back from their 91-point defeat to Collingwood last week with an impressive and clinical performance.
It was a tough day out for the Tigers, who might have a few more games like that this season.

Seth Campbell kicked a great goal but his celebration was a long way from the backflip he did after his sealer against Carlton last week. After a quick smile, he breathed out a heavy puff of air and trudged back to his starting position.
Meanwhile, Rhyan Mansell is sitting on the bench with ice on his shoulder. Hopefully nothing too bad there.

That's a pretty decent haul for Mitch Georgiades, who has just kicked his fourth major of the day.
The Power aren't taking it easy despite the margin.

Port Adelaide's Lachie Jones had his leg assessed on the sidelines and now is sitting with some ice on it.
While the Power can afford to lose him for the remaining six or so minutes of this game, they'll want him back sooner rather than later with a few defenders out already.

Tiger fans will be loving watching Harry Armstrong continue to push as hard as he can, despite the demoralising scoreline.
The young Tiger has kicked the last two goals of the game, having just put through his second.

That's a moment Harry Armstrong will remember for a long time.
The teenage Tiger drilled home his first goal in senior footy from a set shot. He had two goes at it, first kicking a behind before marking it again inside 50 to have another (this time successful) shot.

Adelaide have emphatically broken their MCG drought, mauling Essendon by 61 points to show more signs of an AFL resurgence.
The Crows' 25.11 (161) to 15.10 (100) demolition on Saturday is their first win at the venue since 2017, when they lost the grand final to Richmond.
That season was also the last time Adelaide made the top eight.
After also scoring freely and easily beating an injury-depleted St Kilda at home last week to start their season, Essendon at the MCG loomed as a much tougher proposition for Adelaide.
But the Crows took control early in the first term and dominated as the Bombers lacked pressure and intent for much of the mismatch.
Trailing by 40 points at half-time, Essendon kicked the first two goals of the third term to show some fight.
But Adelaide then steamrolled them with seven of the next nine goals and had the game wrapped up by 57 points at the last change.
Captain Jordan Dawson led superbly and was best afield with 33 possessions, while Ben Keays kicked four goals in front of 46,688 fans.
Dawson's counterpart Zach Merrett kicked four goals and racked up a game-high 36 disposals on a dirty day for Essendon in ideal conditions.
Adelaide star Izak Rankine was subbed out of the game late in the third term, not long after he had kicked a stunning goal on the run from the boundary line.
By Marnie Vinall
There's not much Richmond coach Adam Yze can do about this. Port Adelaide hold an 81-point lead with a quarter left to play.
The Power have been impressive as they've moved the ball cleanly, quickly and with great team composure.
Meanwhile, the Tigers have had patches of good footy, but really need to find a way to get their hands to the ball and increase their workrate.
Power by 81 at 3QT

Port Adelaide are transitioning the ball with ease. Once they get hands to the ball, they are moving it with pace without much trouble from the opposition.
Darcy Byrne-Jones is the latest player to finish off a seamless passage of play with a goal.

Port Adelaide fans can't get enough of what they're seeing at Adelaide Oval.

Kamdyn McIntosh has put through Richmond's sixth goal of the day.
That's three goals to four for the Tigers this third quarter. So, a much better performance than the first half.

A big smile spread across Port Adelaide skipper Connor Rozee's face after he kicked his second major of the day.
The highest margin the Power have beaten the Tigers by is 84 points. They are looking on track to beat that today if they keep up this steady stream of goals.
Power by 77
By Marnie Vinall
There's a moment to cheer, Tiger faithful. Sam Lalor put through Richmond's fourth goal of the day.
The prized No.1 pick received the ball, took one step and kicked it through the big sticks from outside 50.
Following it was Jacob Blight with his first of the day.
The couple of goals came after Jason Horne-Francis burst out of contest to get the ball into the hands of his side Connor Rozee, who kicked a major.

US boxer and businessman George Foreman dies aged 76,Star Cats recruit ruled out of Saints clash as Power thump Tigers,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-22/george-foreman-us-boxer-dies-aged-76/105084628,"US heavyweight boxing champion and businessman George Foreman has died aged 76, according to a statement from his family.
Foreman passed away on Friday local time, his family announced on Instagram.
""A humanitarian, an Olympian, and two time heavyweight champion of the world,"" the statement read.
He was deeply respected — a force for good, a man of discipline, conviction, and a protector of his legacy, fighting tirelessly to preserve his good name — for his family.
""We are grateful for the outpouring of love and prayers, and kindly ask for privacy as we honor the extraordinary life of a man we were blessed to call our own.""
Foreman won the world heavyweight title after beating the then-undefeated Joe Frazier in 1973.
He defended the belt twice before suffering his first professional loss to Muhammad Ali in the famous Rumble in the Jungle in 1974.
Two decades later, ""Big George"" knocked out Michael Moorer to claim his second crown.

Foreman's comeback and the fortune he made selling fat-wicking electric cooking grills made him an icon of self-improvement and success for the Baby Boomer generation.
Born in 1949, the boxer grew up poor in the segregated American South, before dropping out of junior high school and using his size and fists in street robberies.
He would later write he was ""rescued"" from ""the gutter"" by the the Job Corps, part of US president Lyndon B Johnson's ""Great Society"" reforms.
Through the program, 16-year-old Foreman moved out of Texas and was encouraged to channel his rage and growing bulk into boxing.
At age 19 and in his 25th amateur fight, Foreman captured the heavyweight boxing gold medal at the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City.
Turning pro, he won 37 straight matches on his way to face reigning champion Frazier in Kingston, Jamaica, winning by technical knockout in round two.

Foreman defended the belt twice more before meeting Ali in Kinshasa, Zaire, now the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in one of the most celebrated boxing matches in history.
Ali had been stripped of his crown seven years prior for refusing to be drafted into the Vietnam War and be came into the match a heavy underdog against the bigger, younger champion.
But for seven rounds, Ali lay against the ropes and fended off Foreman's clubbing blows, tiring and knocking him out in the eighth round.
""I was one strong heavyweight punching fighter,"" Foreman told Reuters in 2007.
The loss devastated Foreman.
He took a year off before returning to the ring and then, after a second professional loss, retired in 1977 to become an ordained minister in the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ.
A decade later and considerably heavier at 143 kilograms, Foreman staged an unlikely return to the ring to raise money for a youth centre he founded in Texas.
He went on to win 24 straight matches, gradually slimming down along the way, before losing to Evander Holyfield in a 12-round decision in 1991.
Three years later, he knocked out undefeated southpaw Moorer to become the oldest-ever heavyweight champion at age 45.
Foreman's last match was in 1997 and he ended his career with a professional record of 76 wins and five losses.
Foreman was married four times in the 1970s and 1980s.
In 1985, he married for the fifth time to Mary Joan Martelly, who he remained with for the rest of his life.
He had five sons — all called George — five biological daughters, and two adopted daughters.
Throughout the 1990s and after retirement, he was an enthusiastic pitchman for various products, most notably an electric grill from home appliance maker Salton Inc.
In 1999, the company paid Foreman and his partners $US137.5 million ($219.19 million) to put his name on the grill and other goods.
""What I do is fall in love with every product I sell,"" Foreman wrote in his autobiography By George.

"IPL 2025: Mitchell Starc, Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood headline 15 Australian players in action",Star Cats recruit ruled out of Saints clash as Power thump Tigers,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-21/cricket-ipl-2025-australian-players-list-starc-hazlewood-cummins/105082262,"After ""personal views"", a birth of a child, and another frustrating injury, Australia's legendary fast-bowling trio will finally return to the field in the Indian Premier League.
Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood were all sorely missed by Australia in the Champions Trophy as they exited in the semi-finals to eventual winners India.
Cummins hasn't played cricket at any level since leading Australia to retaining the Border-Gavaskar trophy in January.
The Test and ODI captain sat out the tour of Sri Lanka due to the birth of his second child.
Starc was the only fast bowler Australia used during the two Test wins in Sri Lanka, but the 35-year-old opted to miss the Champions Trophy because of ""personal views"" he didn't elaborate on.
But the left-arm quick was also recovering physically from a big summer and the rest would have been beneficial.

Then there is Josh Hazlewood, who has endured a torturous run with injury that meant he was restricted to just two of the five Tests against India.
The 34-year-old is back with Royal Challengers Bangalore after missing last year's edition due to the birth of his first child.
Cummins will again be joined at Sunrisers Hyderabad by three-format star Travis Head, as well as leg-spinner Adam Zampa.
While Cummins and Head will make up a crucial part of the Sunrisers' title bid, Zampa is set to fight for his position against Indian spinner Rahul Chahar.
Cummins and Head helped the franchise make last year's IPL final, eventually losing to Starc's Kolkata Knight Riders.

Even though Starc found form late in the tournament and produced a crucial spell in the decider that resulted him being crowned player of the match, he was not retained by the Knight Riders and instead will play for the Delhi Capitals this year.
Starc will link up with Jake Fraser-McGurk in Delhi after the young blaster made a huge impact with the Capitals last season.
Fraser-McGurk was hot property last May, but he has struggled for form since, domestically and internationally.
But a return to Indian conditions where the IPL usually produces batting-friendly pitches could help him rediscover his best.

Broome Cup result upended as trainer admits winner Vevinsky had banned substance in system,Star Cats recruit ruled out of Saints clash as Power thump Tigers,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-21/broome-cup-winner-vevinsky-disqualified-placings-change/105080780,"The result of one of northern Western Australia's landmark country racing events has been up-ended with the winning horse disqualified for a banned substance in its system.
Six-year-old gelding Vevinsky, ridden by jockey Kristo Sardelic and trained by Derby's Kelvin Moore, won the 2,200m Broome Cup by three and a half lengths in August.
But the result was thrown into doubt when testing detected lignocaine, a banned anaesthetic, in Vevinsky's blood.
Vevinsky claimed the 2024 Broome Cup but has now been disqualified. (ABC Kimberley: Hinako Shiraishi)
Following an inquiry by Racing WA stewards, Mr Moore pleaded guilty to a charge of ""presenting a horse to race"" with a prohibited substance in its system.
""I made it clear to the stewards I was not responsible for administering the substance to the horse, nor did I have any knowledge at the time the horse had been treated with a prohibited substance,"" Mr Moore said in a statement, issued by his lawyer Tom Percy.
""There is no evidence the horse was assisted to any degree by the presence of the substance in its system.""
Stewards have accepted Mr Moore's plea and will deliver a penalty within a fortnight.
""To lose the Broome Cup in circumstances such as this is a devastating blow to me and the horse's owners,"" Mr Moore said.
Mr Moore's statement said he took ""every possible precaution to ensure the horse presented drug-free on the day"".

The disqualification of Vevinsky means the $54,000 purse will go to the second-placed horse, Acermetric Trainer, trained by Dean Cocivera.
Mr Cocivera's fourth-placed Zadar Rock will move up to third, while trainer Darryn Pateman's Gambler's Gold is boosted to second place from third.

Both trainers told the ABC of their dismay at the ""unusual circumstances"", but would ""happily accept the prize money"".
South Hedland-based trainer Mr Cocivera said he had mixed emotions about the news that his horse was now the 2024 Broome Cup winner.
""We strive to win a Broome Cup, but it's not the circumstances we wanted,"" he said.
Both trainers spoke highly of Kelvin Moore, a fixture of the racing industry in northern WA.
Racing WA has not revealed any additional details surrounding the investigation.
Owned by a cohort of Derby families, Vevinsky had a stellar year in 2024, winning the Kimberley Cup in Broome and the Derby Cup at the West Kimberley Turf Club.
Those wins are not in question.
""The racehorses are athletes and it's the responsibility we take as trainers when we get our licence,"" Mr Cocivera said.

""Every race is very stringent with controls and auditing, cameras are on the jockeys to see they're riding to the best of their ability, and chemical testing is getting better and better with science.""
Mr Cocivera said it had taken a lot to get Acermetric Trainer in condition for the Cup, and the team was impressed with its performance running second.
""And Zadar's got 12 or 13 owners in him so they'll be pleased to get a bit more money in the bank,"" he said.",ABC News,sports
Matt Graham wins dual moguls bronze at FIS Freestyle and Snowboard World Championships,Star Cats recruit ruled out of Saints clash as Power thump Tigers,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-22/dual-moguls-world-championships-matt-graham-wins-bronze-medal/105084334,"Australia's Matt Graham has collected a bronze medal in the men's dual moguls at the FIS Freestyle and Snowboard World Championships in St Moritz, Switzerland.
The result gave Graham his fifth World Championships medal, the most won by any Australian winter sports athlete.
Graham lost to gold medallist Mikael Kingsbury of Canada in an eventful semifinal, with the Australian losing a ski at high speed before cartwheeling down the course.
Contesting the small final, Graham completed a solo run to be awarded the bronze medal after Swedish opponent Filip Gravenfors pushed out of the start gate but was unable to continue due to injury.
Gravenfors had been injured during a crash in his semifinal against Japanese silver medallist Ikuma Horishima.
""It was probably one of the hardest-earned podiums of my career"" Graham said.
""The course was challenging. It was icy at the start of the day and consequently the top air landing and first five turns got trashed.
""On paper, the course wasn't that tricky but there were a few little technical elements to it.""
Graham's compatriot Cooper Woods claimed eighth place, while fellow Australians Jackson Harvey (18th) and George Murphy (23rd) finished further down the standings.

How Canterbury plan to cover for injuries to Matt Burton and Viliame Kikau,"Thu, 20 Mar3024→",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-19/bulldogs-eels-matt-burton-viliame-kikau-canterbury/105072018,"Canterbury are fully aware there are few men in the NRL who can play like Viliame Kikau and Matt Burton but that's exactly why the Bulldogs are sure they've got the code to cover for the absence of their two most creative attacking players.
Burton and Kikau both sustained knee injuries in Sunday's win over the Titans, with Burton expected to miss two to four weeks while Kikau is out for three to six.
It means Cameron Ciraldo's side will look to Bailey Hayward in the halves and Sitili Tupouniua down the left edge, starting with this Sunday's clash with arch-rivals Parramatta.
But the new duo won't be asked to do an impression of the injured stars, with Canterbury backing them to play to their own strengths in order to fill the gap.

""Whoever is covering them won't try and play like them or be them. They'll just play to their abilities, do what they do well. We have full confidence in them,"" said lock forward Jaeman Salmon.
""Nobody is going to do more than they usually would. We have a game plan we want to stick to and we need to execute that. Nobody will be doing too much.
""We don't expect Milk (Heyward) to come in and play like Burto. He's going to play like himself and do a great job for us.
""He's a great fella, a great communicator. We have full faith in the system and the job he'll do for us.""
Hayward came through the grades as a half but since his NRL debut last year has played nearly every minute as a lock and while Tupouniua has plenty of starting experience from his Roosters days, there are few backrowers in the world with Kikau's arsenal of attacking weapons.
Those attacking skills have been on show early in the season, with Kikau accumulating three try assists in the club's first two matches — including the first try of both wins on identical sweep patterns down the left that put Marcelo Montoya over.
Both times it was Burton who manufactured the space for Kikau's creativity and the five-eighth also acts as the side's primary in-play kicker — in the season opener against St George Illawarra, Burton took 18 of the side's 19 kicks in general play.
That task will now fall mainly on halfback Toby Sexton, who did a fine job of taking the team around the park following Burton's departure from last week's win over the Titans.
The 24-year-old lacks the star profile of other playmakers but it was his introduction to the scrum base that helped set the Bulldogs on the course to last year's finals berth.
Through two weeks he's continued that form and will be tasked with an even greater share of the attacking responsibility against the Eels and in the weeks to come.
""He's a great organiser. He's a good talker on the field, he directs us around and he has that calm voice on the field,"" Salmon said.
""He's had a great start to the season, like a few of the boys, and if we keep that going it'll put us in good stead.""
With Sexton's direction, Heyward's ability to dig into the line and Tupouniua's strength as a hole-runner, it points to a direct, physical style of attack against the Eels.
But not having Burton and Kikau reduces the margin of error for Canterbury.
Host Darcie McDonald is joined by former NRL winger Josh Mansour to bring you your daily dose of NRL conversation. The team give you context and depth beyond the headlines in this footy conversation that's equal parts thoughtful, insightful and fun.
They're the sort of players who can create something from nothing, or can transform a poor set or attacking movement in a second due to their prodigious skills.
So in the meantime, it's the system that must stand tall.
The Dogs have lost some of their brilliance, so they must compensate by being more methodical and deliberate and by outlasting their opponents rather than knocking them out with a couple of big shots.
For a team that prides itself on being built on hard work, it may still add up to a winning formula this weekend, especially given the Eels' lacklustre start to the year.
But given this is Canterbury and Parramatta, there's little chance of complacency when the two old rivals meet at Stadium Australia on Sunday.
""[I like] the competitiveness [of the rivalry],"" Salmon said.
""It's going to go down to the last section of the game.
""Both teams will be out on their feet at stages so we have to work hard because we know they're going to bring their best game.""
""We'll be ready for it.""",ABC News,sports

West Tigers have scored three second half tries defeat the Dolphins in Redcliffe.
The Dolphins had a 18-12 lead at half-time, but in front of their home fans, the Dolphins could not trouble the scorers in the second half.
By Michael Doyle
Game over.
Tigers hooker Apisai Koroisau has thrown a dummy pass as the Tigers shaped to attempt a field goal.
The Dolphins fell for the dummy, and there were no markers.
Koroisau runs himself, and from 15 metres out, he bolted, stepped through the defence, then buried his head and crashed over the line.
Brilliant from Api. Brilliant.
By Michael Doyle
The Dolphins have stepped up a gear, trying to get the game-levelling try.
But the final pass seems to be falling the home side.
Jamayne Isaako dropped a pass that was behind him from Jake Averillo, as the winger was threatening to break down the sideline.
By Michael Doyle
It has taken 69 minutes, but West Tigers have their first lead of the match.
A drop ball from the Dolphins inside their own 10-metre line gave Wests a full set at the line.
Dummy half  Apisai Koroisau, on last tackle, shaped to kick but then produced a lovely short pass to second-rower Alex Seyfarth who crashed over to score.
By Michael Doyle
Pressure finally pays off for the Wests Tigers.
Sunia Turuva scores his second try of the afternoon, and his team's third.
Wests had threatened to score all half. Finally, a nice looping pass from five-eighth Lachlan Galvin to Adam Doueihi.
That pass took two Dolphins out of the play and created an overlap on the right wing.
Doueihi passes to Turuva who scores.
Doueihi's conversion was successful, after hitting the post.
By Michael Doyle
The first 15 minutes of this half has been dominated by Wests Tigers.
The forwards for the visitors have been strong up the middle, and Jarome Luai is starting to control the flow of the game.
But the Dolphins have not budged on their goal line.
The latest chance ended with centre Starford To'a dropping the ball as he tried to break free of a tackle and reach for the line.
Dolphins fullback Hamiso Tabuai-Fidow seems to be everywhere. Every kick attacking kick by Wests has been fielded by the Queensland State of Origin rep.
By Michael Doyle
This is not what Tigers' fans want to see.
Winger Jeral Skelton has just limped off the field, looking in a lot of discomfort.
He chased through a grubber kick earlier and looked lame in that run.
Hopefully it is not a serious injury, but his face suggested he was in some pain.
By Michael Doyle
Wests Tigers have given away three penalties in the opening seven minutes of this second half.
That will not please coach Benji Marshall, who according to ABC Sport sideline eye Zane Bojack, pleaded with his troops to clean up their discipline.
They were behind on the penalty count, 5-1, in the first half.

Go the mighty Phins!
- Mike
G'day Mike.
Thanks for joining me on the ABC Sport live blog of today's NRL.
The Dolphins were good in that first 40 minutes.
Halves pairing Isaiya Katoa and Kodi Nikorima looked really slick at times in that first half.
But I thought the Tigers' first 10 minutes and last 10 minutes were good. They fell away in the middle, but strong carries up the centre opened up the Dolphins' defence.
I am looking forward to bringing you the action in the second half.
By Michael Doyle
A competitve first half has come to an end.
The Dolphins have a six-point lead, scoring three tries in the first half, compared to Wests two.
The Dolphins will have the advantage of a strong wind at their backs for the second half.
Wests will be pleased with how they finished that half. They started to play more direct, up the middle, and it paid dividends with a late try to reduce the deficit to six points.
By Michael Doyle
Interchange dummy half Tallyn Da Silva has burrowed over from close range to score for the Tigers.
It came after West's first penalty of the match, giving them a chance to get into Dolphin territory.
Fellow interchange Jack Bird made a strong run in the play before, taking three Dolphin defenders to bring him down.
Da Silva then caught the markers napping, ducked his head, and wrestled his way to the try line.
By Michael Doyle
The penalty count is 5-0 to the Dolphins. It is really costing the Wests Tigers.
A clear penalty was given against Wests for holding the tackled player down.
It is 20 metres out and in front, so Jamayne Isaako kicks the goal for two more points.
By Michael Doyle
The Dolphins came so close to having a fourth try.
A grubber kick from Isaiya Katoa led to a foot race for the footy.
The Dolphins centre Jake Averillo looked certain to score, but he dropped the footy as he was trying to collect the bouncing ball.
Had he collected the ball cleanly, he would have fallen over the line for the try.
The Tigers get a massive reprieve.
By Michael Doyle
Kodi Nikorima is over, and the Dolphons have a third try.
The Dolphins five-eighth got on the outside of Tigers half Jarome Luai and made a dash for the line.
Luai produced a great tackle, but the moment of the tackle guided Nikorima over the white line.
The Dolphins have started to dominate the middle of the field, and it has resulted in a 10-point lead.
By Michael Doyle
The Dolphins have hit the front again as Herbie Farnworth scores under the posts.
The Dolphins, just two minutes ago, were defending their line.
In the next set, they marched up field then five-eighth Kodi Nikorima was running across the field and threw a terrific short pass to prop Daniel Saifiti.
The big man burst through the hole, drew in the Tigers' fullback, and passed to Farnworth for the try.
By Michael Doyle
Wests Tigers winger Sunia Turuva has scored in the right corner for the away side.
The Dolphins committed the cardinal sin of dropping the ball on the set after they score points.
Dolphin prop Felise Kaufusi dropped the ball a strong tackle.
From that mistake, the Tigers were able to work the Dolphins defence.
Hooker Apisai Koroisau and halfback Jarome Luai combined to create an overlap and put Turuva in the corner.
By Michael Doyle
It is the perfect start for the Dolphins in Redcliffe, as winger Jack Bostock scores.
It was a nice move from the Dolphins, shifting to the left late in the tackle count.
Isaiya Katoa passed out the back to Herbie Farnworth.
Farnworth held the ball for as long as he could, drew in the opposing winger, and passed to Bostock who scores in the corner.",ABC News,sports
Club culture investigation drags on as Queensland Firebirds look for fresh start,By Brittany Carter,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-19/queensland-firebirds-club-culture-investigation-drags-on/105066116,"Last June, ABC Sport broke the news that the Queensland Firebirds and head coach Bec Bulley were parting ways with five weeks left in the season.
In September, we then revealed an investigation had been launched into the club's culture following a player complaint suggesting a toxic environment for athletes.
Now it's March, six months have passed and Netball Australia is still yet to resolve the issue, leaving outcomes for the club and individuals involved up in the air.
Defender Remi Kamo was the first Super Netballer to ever go through with the process of lodging an official complaint of this kind. Now we wonder whether the drawn-out process will discourage others from coming forward in future.

Bulley has since moved back to NSW and resumed her previous position as the head coach of the Giants Academy, while the Firebirds have made several changes to their Super Netball side in the off-season, recognising the need for a fresh start.
The club recruited New Zealand coach Kiri Wills, who is well-known for creating culturally safe environments where players feel like they belong.
One of the ways Wills has reportedly tried to inspire her new team is to sit them down to watch the Firebirds' last premiership victory in 2016 during the trans-Tasman era. This, she hoped, would remind them of the legacy that exists at the once-great club.
New co-captains were appointed — Ruby Bakewell-Doran and Hulita Veve — and new imports were signed. English mid-courter Imogen Allison, who won silver at the last Netball World Cup, and 201cm Ugandan shooter Mary Cholhok took the places of retiring captain Kim Ravaillion and Indigenous Diamond Donnell Wallam.

Up-and-coming Firebirds Futures talent Ash Barnett also replaced Kamo. These three roster changes were made by the club before Wills had been appointed.
Fans did not take well to the news that Kamo and Wallam were not going to be offered contracts for 2025 — especially seeing as Wallam was second in the league for goals last season (556), and Kamo had more intercepts (17) and defensive rebounds (20) than any other Firebird.
Their departure didn't sit right with the two players either. They no longer follow the team on social media, nor did they attend the end-of-season awards dinner.
Instead, they watched the new-look Firebirds take the court over the weekend in Adelaide at the Team Girls Cup from Auckland, where Wallam will play with the Mystics and Kamo the Stars.

Who could blame them if they felt justified in their ability? They embark on new adventures elsewhere while their former team finished last at the pre-season tournament after failing to win a game. When they themselves believe they were cast aside and made out to be the problem in last year's line-up.
Still, there is a lot of goodwill amongst the community for the Firebirds in 2025 as fans hold out hope that the team will unite under Wills and be able to fix their mid-court feeding issues, especially with the likes of Cholhok leading from the front.
The She Cranes goal shooter sets a new record in the competition as the tallest Super Netball player to feature across its nine seasons.
They've been slow to get going, with their imports joining later than other teams once their international commitments wrapped at the Nations Cup in February.

Their pre-season practice matches were also impacted by Cyclone Alfred.
Still, there were positive signs at the Team Girls Cup as the weekend wore on, with the team reducing its losing margins across four appearances from 15 goals to two.
But the question remains, can they move on and find that redemption arc this season with Netball Australia's investigation still hanging over their heads?
Wills would certainly love her team to break away from past issues and start her era at the helm with a better finish than last year — where they narrowly avoided the wooden spoon, managed just four wins from 14 games and conceded more goals than any other team (970).
Surely the best thing for everyone involved would be for the ongoing investigation to be put to bed before the official Super Netball season starts on April 5, and Kamo begins her campaign with the Stars in the New Zealand Premiership in May.

Usman Khawaja hits back at 'inflammatory' Queensland Cricket claims ahead of Sheffield Shield final,Star Cats recruit ruled out of Saints clash as Power thump Tigers,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-21/sheffield-shield-usman-khawaja-queensland-cricket/105080238,"Usman Khawaja has launched a passionate defence of his Sheffield Shield absence, slamming Queensland's head of cricket Joe Dawes for ""categorically untrue"" comments that left him ""fuming"".
A furore erupted when Dawes took aim at the Australia Test opener for sitting out the drawn match with South Australia in Adelaide that enabled the Bulls to qualify for the final.
Khawaja, set to be named in the Bulls' side for the Sheffield Shield final in Adelaide next week, called a media conference on Friday to offer an explanation.
He said a plan had been formulated with Cricket Australia (CA) medical staff and selector George Bailey to manage an ongoing hamstring complaint that he had played through in the previous round against Tasmania.
That match took place as Cyclone Alfred hit Brisbane. Khawaja left his young family to play and score a century despite batting in discomfort.
He said he had not spoken to Dawes — who said Khawaja had the all-clear from medical staff to play South Australia — in over a month.
""Joey said the medical staff had no idea: that is 100 per cent wrong,"" he said.
""I was talking to the Australian physio the whole time.
""Everyone knew about it … that was one of the most shocking things … categorically untrue.
""I don't do anything without talking to CA first. They always have final say.""
Khawaja said he had been in regular contact with Cricket Australia's medical staff. (ABC News: Curtis Rodda)
Khawaja said he had texted Bulls coach Johan Botha to inform him of his original plan that was based around not playing back-to-back fixtures but never got a reply.
He said it ""felt like it would pop"" in Tasmania, resorting to jogging while at the crease as the Bulls posted a vital nine-wicket win.
But at no stage was that management plan, or the injury, discussed with Botha or Queensland Cricket.
Khawaja, contracted to CA, considered the situation under control until speculation swirled last week.
The 38-year-old then attended Melbourne's Australian Grand Prix, mixing photos of his time on the grid with one of him doing hamstring rehabilitation on his social media account.
On the Bulls' return to Brisbane on Wednesday, Dawes claimed Khawaja was available for selection.
""I go off our medical staff and there is no reason why he could not have played the last game,"" Dawes said.
""It's just disappointing he didn't play a game for Queensland when he had an opportunity to.""

Khawaja said he had CA's blessing to attend the Grand Prix and was happy to mend his relationship with Dawes — a former Sheffield Shield-winning fast bowler for the Bulls — after next week's final.
""I go home and curl up in a ball, or I go and watch F1,"" Khawaja said.
""I still look after my body. It's not by any coincidence I'm 38 and still playing.
""The optics look bad … that's why I wanted to speak out.
""I still do love Queensland Cricket, no matter what happens.""
Khawaja has his sights set on continuing in Test cricket until the end of next summer's home Ashes series.
He captained the Bulls to their last Sheffield Shield title in 2020/21 when Australia teammate Marnus Labuschagne was player of the match with a brilliant 193 in an emphatic innings and 33-run defeat of NSW at Allan Border Field.
Labuschagne, who will captain the Bulls in the Shield final, was not concerned when he spoke earlier about the Khawaja situation.
He said the left-hander missing the match in Adelaide and being available for the final was in essence ""the perfect result"".
""We understand if we want the best out of him he's going to need to make sure he's ready to go and fresh so he doesn't get himself injured,"" Labuschagne said.

The sporting innovators — how Ryan Campbell and Doug Marillier both have claims to cricket's ramp shot,"Introducing Sam Konstas, Australian cricket's future",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-02-16/the-history-of-the-ramp-shot-in-cricket/104932908,"It's December 2002, and Australia A wicketkeeper Ryan Campbell is about to do something completely audacious.
The West Australian is facing Sri Lankan left arm quick Nuwan Zoysa in a one-day match at the Gabba.
As Zoysa releases the ball, Campbell steps his right leg across to the offside so that he's facing front-on to the bowler. He crouches low and extends his bat directly out in front of him.
The ball bounces just in front of Campbell, who keeps moving across to the offside while simultaneously flipping the ball over his left shoulder and the disbelieving Sri Lankan wicketkeeper down to the boundary for four.
Two balls later he does it again, flipping a full toss directly over the keeper's head.
As Campbell's momentum takes him further across to the off-side he completes a commando roll, while the ball bounces just once before going over to the boundary rope and into the sightscreen.
In a little over 90 minutes and with only 65 balls faced, Sam Konstas's debut innings in the Boxing Day Test has forced Australian cricket into a new generation, and there is no going back now.
Ryan Campbell had just invented the ramp shot … or had he?
Fast forward 22 years and Sam Konstas is intent on throwing Indian fast bowler Jaspit Bumrah off his game during the Boxing Day Test in Melbourne.
Konstas plays a series of ramp shots lurching Australian Test match cricket forward into a new era.
His ramp shots that shocked and delighted in equal measure had hitherto been deemed too risky for Test cricket — in Australia at least.
Not so in England, where the country's all-time leading Test run-scorer Joe Root savaged Australia with reverse ramp shots (switching to a left-handed grip) during the 2023 Ashes series.
Konstas and Root are the exceptions. For around two decades, the ramp shot had been solely used in white-ball cricket, where attacking batting and daring shot play has greater currency in the risk versus reward equation of shorter games.
The invention of the ramp was revolutionary because it opened up a sizeable quadrant of the ground which had effectively been out of play.
A batter could play an array of shots that accessed most areas of the ground from third man to fine leg.
Those shots were taken from the so-called 'textbook' — a mythical publication that prescribed the correct technique for playing cuts, drives, hooks, glances and so on.
But according to the textbook, the pizza slice of the ground between fine leg and third man was essentially out of bounds for attacking shots.
It was the ramp — sometimes called the scoop or lap scoop — that really changed everything, bringing in to play the section of the ground behind the wicketkeeper.
Now batting was truly a 360-degree game.
But when did it begin and who was the first to invent a shot that has fundamentally changed cricket?
Tune in for the latest cricket news, interviews and analysis from the ABC team in the Grandstand Cricket Podcast.
Which brings us back to Ryan Campbell at the Gabba in 2002.
The idea of a ramp shot, he explained, was a theory that had been playing around in his head for some time:
""I, as the wicketkeeper had to sit through so many bowlers' meetings in one-day cricket of how we were going to bowl at the death,"" Campbell told ABC Sport.
Each time the group reached the same consensus:
""We're going to be really full at the death and we're going to have fine leg up in the circle and we're going to have mid-on back and we're going to get hit down the ground,"" Campbell said.
""And I just sat there (and) I had a theory.
""I literally thought 'well, the one thing in cricket that we don't know as a batsman is where the bowler is going to try and bowl'.
""That's the skill of batting — it's we don't know what the bowler is going to do. But I'm thinking to myself, well, now I do know. I know exactly what everyone's going to bowl at the end.
""And if I can get down to it on the full, get it over fine leg and then every bowler is going to absolutely not know what to do.""
That theory sat and slowly fermented over time, but Campbell said he never practised the shot.
""I didn't want to make a fool of myself,"" he said.
""Because I felt, if I tried it, every chance I was going to get hit in the head — and that's why in all honesty I named it 'Stupidity'.
While he never practised the shot, he had thought a lot about the technique he would use if he ever tried it in a match.

His theory was to feign a move to the leg side, forcing the bowler to attempt a yorker.
""And once that happened, I just had to get low enough and I had to get my head as close to the line of the ball as possible, 'cause if I watch the ball onto the bat, I just felt I was never going to miss it,"" Campbell said.
""I wanted to hit it on the full that was the whole thing, in a perfect world, I'm going to hit that ball on the full.""
That was the theory and in December 2002 while Campbell was playing a state one-day match for Western Australia and Victoria, the opportunity arose to put the plan into action.
ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.
Campbell was batting and as he tells it, his Victorian wicketkeeping counterpart, Darren Berry, was mercilessly sledging him.
""He was having a crack at me, I was having a crack at him and Ian Harvey was bowling,"" Campbell said.
That Ian Harvey was bowling was another factor in Campbell's favour. The two had been at the Australian Cricket Academy together and so Campbell knew Harvey's tricks — like his preference for bowling slow yorkers at the end of one-day matches.
""And I'm thinking: 'right I'm going to try and hit Darren Barry right in the face here and give every cricketer a break from his mouth constantly yapping',"" Campbell said.
""And that was what I needed to try it, and basically I tried it twice in the over.
""Unfortunately, I missed Darren's mouth, but it kept going for four and I thought to myself I'm onto something.""
The shot Campbell called ""Stupidity"" was born.
A week later, Campbell got a late call-up to play for Australia A against Sri Lanka.
With instructions from his captain Justin Langer to bat aggressively, he decided the time was right to play a shot he'd only tried once before.
""You know, here it is, fine leg's up mid-off, mid-on back, time to try and do it,"" Campbell said.
""I just felt that my theory was sound, and I had proven to myself the week before that it worked and you know, put your money where your mouth is so to speak, and the rest, as they say, is history.""
Back in the dressing room, his teammates were agog.
""There was a lot of conversation of 'what was that?'"" he said
""They're asking me the theory and all this sort of stuff, and I joked around of course about trying to hit Darren the week before.
""And you know it was nice to hear them say well 'the theory is sound'.
""I think that's where the word got around, and you know people started to do it more and more.""
Is he proud of his legacy in the game?
""Oh yeah of course,"" he said
""You know I didn't get to play one million games for Australia or anything like that … I wasn't a headline act. I was sort of a guy who did well for his state.
""But you know, to be remembered a little bit because I invented something then yeah, of course, that you know tells me that I had the courage of my convictions. I guess doing the ramp was something that I'm very proud of.""
But unknown to Campbell, almost two years before, an unheralded wicketkeeper/batsman from Zimbabwe had tried the same thing.
On January 2, 2001, Doug Marillier played a ramp shot in a one-day match in Taupo against New Zealand fast-bowler Chris Martin.
Footage shows Marillier moving subtly to the off-side, just before Martin bowled.
""He bowled a sort of hip-high full toss to try to follow me, but because I'd baulked inside it, I was now on the inside the ball and I just tapped the ball and it went over the short fine leg for four,"" Marillier told ABC Sport from Harare.
""I didn't call it a ramp, I called it a sweep shot,"" he said.
Marillier said he had never seen anyone play his version of the ""sweep"" shot before, but he thought he was on to something.
""So, I started hitting the ball in the nets,"" he said.
""As long as your head was on the inside of the ball, really there was no risk in terms of the shot being played.""
Echoing Campbell, he said knowing the bowler was going to bowl full and straight at the end of the innings, gave him an advantage.
""Unfortunately, I'm not very good at hitting the ball over mid-off, so I had to come up with something else,"" he said.
""To a certain extent, it was quite easy to play because you knew where the ball was going to be before the bowler let it go.
Later that January, Zimbabwe toured Australia for a triangular one-day tournament that included the West Indies.
Marillier wasn't selected until the final match of the tournament against Australia in Perth on February 4.
Batting second, Zimbabwe was chasing Australia's 302.
Marillier came in with the score on 288 with Zimbabwe needing 15 runs to win off the final over of the match.
He was facing one of the all-time greats, Glenn McGrath.
Earlier, Marillier had told his teammates that he was going to use his ""sweep"" shot against McGrath.
""The guys who were in the change room with me were a bit agitated by that because obviously they were saying: 'don't be ridiculous, you're not going to sweep Glenn McGrath, that's ridiculous',"" Marillier said.
""But really that was the only option.""
It's exactly what he did — on the first ball of his innings, the first time he'd faced Glenn McGrath and in his first innings of the tour.
McGrath bowled a full toss just outside off stump, allowing Marillier to move way across to the offside and scoop the ball over fine leg to the boundary.
Bill Lawry in commentary was typically excitable: ""Oooh he's got it away, good cricket. Well, what a good start. You're facing McGrath for the first time, you need 15 off the over. You take a chance. You move across to the off-side and you chip him away.""
Two balls later, Marillier played an identical shot over the head of fine leg who was still up in the circle, leaving Zimbabwe with three balls to score five runs to win.
Slow motion shots show Glenn McGrath walking back to his mark shaking his head in what seems to be a mixture of disgust and disbelief.
""Might be his only shot. It's a beauty,"" said Lawry in commentary.
Unfortunately, Marillier couldn't make it three out of three and Zimbabwe ended up losing by one run.
""It would have been nice to beat Australia at the WACA,"" he said.
But he's proud of what he did — if understated.
""Yeah, nice to have hit McGrath for four, let alone where it goes. Most of the time it goes to the slips,"" he said.
As for the reaction, he said it was typically muted especially among the cricket traditionalists.
""Some of the older, more traditional commentators in the game were like, 'yeah, it's a flash in the pan kind of shot, it's not the kind of shot you can do regularly because bowlers will work you out,"" Marillier said.
He said he also copped criticism from his coaches when he was practising the shot.
""In the nets when you're doing it, and the coaching staff are saying 'you're just messing around',"" he said.
""You know, 'you should be hitting the ball down the ground, or you should practice more orthodox shots'.
""But I played it enough in the nets for me at least to seem that it was a real option because I didn't get it wrong that much.
""Once it had been played, there could be no argument about whether or not it works,"" he said.
Marillier was confident in his theory and technique and showed it to devastating effect a year later in March 2002 in a match against India in Faridabad.
Coming in at number 10, Marillier played the ramp shot four times in a stunning innings of 56 off just 24 balls to steal a remarkable victory for Zimbabwe.
Some of those shots look identical to the modern ramp shot that sends the ball directly over the keeper.
""It was played so many times that it proved that as long as the fine leg is up, it's a really effective shot and it's really hard to bowl to,"" Marillier said.
He said that innings proved the shot could be played against both short and full balls and helped create awareness about the ramp in India.
""I think if you're bat's in the right place and your head's in the right place, then there's not a lot of risk to you.""
Marillier is extremely humble if somewhat rueful that he's only remembered for his improvisation that became known for a time as the ""Marillier Shot"".
He stopped playing international cricket when he was just 24 and now runs a successful property business in Harare.
""I think a lot of people play the shot (and) they wouldn't have a clue who Douglass Marillier is because I wasn't on the scene for long enough,"" he said.
""It's nice from a cricketing point of view to have had an opportunity to do something to be remembered with.""
So, who invented the ramp shot? Was it Douglass Marillier or Ryan Campbell?
We put the spotlight on women making a big impact on and off the field in the sporting world — from the grassroots through to the elite level.
There's little doubt that Marillier played a version of the shot almost two years before Campbell.
But Campbell is adamant that he'd never seen Marillier, let alone heard of him.
""I'll be honest I didn't watch a lot of cricket back then … the last thing you wanted to do as a cricketer was watch more,"" Campbell said.
""So yeah, I hadn't seen it and that's the honest truth.
""But you know if he did it before me, then you know, good on him,"" Cambell said.
It seems two gifted cricketers had independently tapped into something that was needed to take the game of cricket forward.
There's a precedent:
In the late 17th Century, two famous mathematicians, Sir Issac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz, butted up against the limits of their field and independently came up with Calculus — a fundamental method of mathematics that's vital for physics, engineering and other sciences.
The ramp was a shot borne out of necessity to counter defensive full-length bowling in limited overs cricket matches.
But it can only have happened at a time when one-day cricket was evolving — becoming far more attacking — and batters were looking to play more aggressively with more licence to take risks.
Just as Newton and Leibniz had stood on the shoulders of earlier, Greek, Chinese and Arab mathematicians, Marillier and Campbell's ramp shot came after the advent other innovative shots like the reverse sweep and the slash over slips.
The ramp shot is the solution to a question that only in hindsight seems obvious.
But maybe not.
In the 1870's, the legendary Aboriginal cricketer Unaarrimin, known as Johnny Mullagh, was famous for his daring deflections.
""Dropping on one knee to a fast rising ball, he would hold his bat over his shoulder and parallel to the ground,"" DJ Mulvaney writes in his history of the Indigenous cricket tour to England, Cricket Walkabout.
""The ball would touch the blade, and shoot high over the wicket-keeper's head to the boundary.""

Jackson Irvine says Tony Popovic's arrival has forced Socceroos to 'another level up' in World Cup bid,Star Cats recruit ruled out of Saints clash as Power thump Tigers,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-18/football-jackson-irvine-tony-popovic-socceroos-impact/105067184,"Jackson Irvine is leaving no stone unturned in his quest to take the Socceroos to next year's World Cup, undergoing blood tests in a bid to improve his performance levels and retain his place at the heart of Tony Popovic's midfield.
The 32-year-old revealed ahead of Thursday's World Cup qualifier against Indonesia in Sydney how Popovic's appointment as head coach last year prompted him to rethink his approach to football.
Irvine, a veteran of 72 international caps, said that Popovic had brought a ""new intensity and energy"" to the Socceroos' set-up since he replaced Graham Arnold last year.
Since stepping into the top job, Popovic has overhauled his backroom team and appointed Julie Meek, a renowned sports dietician, as part of his support staff.
Players are now subject to stronger dietary standards and Irvine has found Meek's input particularly useful on the way to playing every minute of St Pauli's German Bundesliga campaign.
""I've been working with Julie and we did some blood tests at my club to look at certain levels of things,"" Irvine said.
""I've tried to adapt things into my life and game to make myself better as well.
""You can't stand still in football, there's always young guys performing at the top that are ready to come in.
""I've been a part of this team a long time, but if you want to remain part of it you've got to be able to adapt and change and improve.""
Irvine has also noticed an upturn in dialogue between international camps as Popovic seeks to fine-tune his team's tactical knowledge.
Popovic has used a back three and inverted wingers in his four games in charge of the Socceroos thus far, which have yielded three draws and one win.

Australia sits second and is hanging on to the final automatic place in their group by a solitary point.
""That's another level up to try to raise standards all the time,"" Irvine said.
""A big part of it is making sure that when we come into camp, it's not like it takes you one or two days to flick back into that mode. It's about being ready for that.""
While the changes may have come as a shock to some Socceroos, recalled fullback Jason Davidson knows Popovic's methods all too well.
ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.
Davidson was a surprise inclusion when Popovic named his squad last week for the Indonesia clash and the away qualifier against China on March 25.
But the 33-year-old defender, now with Greek top flight side Panserraikos, has spent extensive time under Popovic's guidance at both Melbourne Victory and Perth Glory in the A-League Men.
""His attention to detail is nothing like I've ever had,"" Davidson said.
""He wants discipline and when this is your job and your body is your tool, you need to maximise everything possible.
""One per cent here, one per cent there — it all adds up.
""Meals, lollies, sugar, sleeping, anything — he's brought in people that are experts in their field — to make sure that he can help the players.""

Australia's Lachlan Kennedy wins historic silver at World Athletics Indoor Championships,Gout dips under 20 seconds with illegal wind,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-22/world-athletics-indoor-championships-lachlan-kennedy/105084230,"Australia's Lachlan Kennedy has claimed a historic silver medal in the men's 60 metres at the World Athletics Indoor Championships after being pipped for gold in a blistering finish in Nanjing, China.
Kennedy stopped the clock in 6.50 seconds in the final, only 0.01 behind Great Britain gold medallist Jeremiah Azu.
South Africa's Akani Simbine took the bronze in 6.54.
It is the first time an Australian has won a medal in the event at the World Athletics Indoor Championships.
Kennedy, 21, was also making his debut on the indoor boards, having only previously run in outdoor meets.
""I've very pleased even though I didn't get the win,"" said Kennedy, whose time was a national indoor record.
""My goal was to go 6.4, but I didn't quite get that, but 6.50 is the next closest thing. I'll take it at the end of the day.""
Kennedy won his heat in 6.52, before clocking 6.54 in his semifinal to finish second to American Ronnie Baker.
""I know I can do so much more, this is only the beginning,"" Kennedy said.
""I'm a bit upset I didn't win, but I definitely got the next best thing.
Gout Gout breaks 20 seconds for the 200 metres, but his time will not stand as a national record due to the assistance of an illegal wind reading.
""Racing three events, with eight hours in between them was weird for me, but in the heat I stumbled and almost fell over after crossing the finish line.
""When I got to the semis, I was hesitant and tensed up a bit and then I thought, 'If I fall over in the final, I fall over', and I just went for it.""
Kennedy will turn his focus to the outdoor season as he looks to dip under 10 seconds for the 100m.
His personal best is 10.03 and he will compete at next Saturday night's Maurie Plant Meet in Melbourne.
The Queenslander's performance in China illustrates the growing depth in men's sprints in Australia, with teenage 200m specialist Gout Gout the headline act.
Elsewhere in Nanjing, Australia's Georgia Griffith reached the women's 1,500m final, finishing runner-up in her heat with a personal best of 4:09.78.

Nick Kyrgios falls to Karen Khachanov in straight-sets defeat at Miami Open,his encouraging first-round victory over Mackenzie McDonald,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-22/miami-open-tennis-nick-kyrgios-karen-khachanov/105084258,"Nick Kyrgios has crashed out of the Miami Open following a 7-6 (7/3), 6-0 defeat to Karen Khachanov in the second round.
The Australian was playing his second match in three days after his encouraging first-round victory over Mackenzie McDonald.
His win over McDonald was his first tour-level triumph since 2022 after spending much of the past few years on the sidelines with injury.
Against Khachanov, Kyrgios delivered a dismal second-set performance in which he mustered just seven points.
World number three Carlos Alcaraz distances himself from the class-action lawsuit filed by Novak Djokovic's Professional Tennis Players' Association against the governing bodies of the sport.
But there was much to applaud about the way he competed against Khachanov in the first set, taking the Russian 22nd seed to a tiebreak.
But after missing the chance to go 3-1 up in the tiebreak, Kyrgios's game fell apart.
He became irritated with himself and his team at courtside, offering a running commentary as the second set progressed.
He smashed a ball high out of court to earn a warning from the chair umpire at one stage, before the second set concluded after just 21 minutes.
It was a display offering a tantalising glimpse of the brilliance Kyrgios can still produce against a player of Khachanov's quality.
Kyrgios's conditioning after his injury setbacks is still clearly nowhere near good enough to rattle the best players, as Khachanov moved on to a clash with Grigor Dimitrov in the last 32.
Another Australian, Rinky Hijikata, lost to 24-time major winner Novak Djokovic 6-0, 7-6 (7/1).
Djokovic had not won a match since his injury exit in the Australian Open semifinals.
Meanwhile, Australia's Tristan Schoolkate also lost in the second round, having been defeated by Canadian Felix Auger-Aliassime 6-4, 6-4.
In the women's draw, Australia's Kim Birrell went down in three sets to Ukraine's 23rd seed Mart Kostyuk, who triumphed 7-5, 4-6, 6-3.

Why the Tigers' win over the Blues rates as one of the biggest AFL upsets in recent memory,"Thu, 20 Mar6080→",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-20/afl-richmond-tigers-carlton-blues-analysis/105070092,"The unexpected nature of the Tigers' 13-point win over the Blues makes it one of their most famous victories of the past decade, which is saying a lot considering the club has claimed three flags in that time frame.
At one point during last Thursday night's match at the MCG, the Blues were not only in control but had their fans wondering how large the winning margin would be.
""To be in the position that we were in early in the match and give up that lead, I couldn't be more disappointed,"" Blues coach Michael Voss said after the match.
In raw terms, it was one of the biggest upsets in recent memory.
But how did the Tigers win and what similarities did the result have to other recent AFL upsets?
Of all the kicks in footy, one stands out as clearly the most important: the shot on goal.
Many were quick to point out the impact on goal-kicking after the Tigers-Blues match, none quicker than Richmond coach Adem Yze.
""Honestly … we lost on expected score,"" Yze said.
""So we've just won a different way today. But we've just got to get better defence.""
Only the scoreboard truly matters in the footy world. But when looking at how teams played, the scoreboard sometimes obscures underlying truths.
There are two words hidden in Yze's response that many inside football treat as a guiding light: expected score.
That's the measure of shot quality adjusted for location, how the ball was gathered and how the kick was taken.
In other terms, it's how well a team plays before the final kick towards goal.
ABC Sport has looked at the 42 biggest upsets in the past four seasons. These are the match-ups where the winning underdog had a chance of victory of less than 25 per cent before the match started.
In these matches, the team favoured to win shot worse than their vanquishers three-quarters of the time.
Often it was conversion that cost the favourite the match, with a slight majority of those close ""underdog wins"" flipped by their opponent's relatively poor shooting.
The Tigers scored 21 more points than expected against the Blues, largely a result of unlikely snags such as Toby Nankervis's above.
By contrast, Carlton converted less accurately than expected. According to wheeloratings.com, the 27-point expected score spread is likely to end in a Blues victory 80 per cent of the time.
That doesn't diminish Richmond's effort, but it does place context around the general flow of play and points out a big indicator of how some upsets emerge.
One way good teams control matches is to play them on their terms.
There's more than one way to win a footy match, but most teams have a preferred way to do it.
A hallmark of control is holding the ball behind the mark. Controlling the ball can take teams out of a match. Maintaining possession through marks is a classic way for good teams to exert their dominance.
It stands to reason that a more chaotic game can open up the chances for an upset.
The easiest — albeit slightly imperfect — way to measure this is by looking at the total number of ground balls won by both teams against the number of total marks.
A match where an unlikely upset occurs will tend to have a little more chaos about it than either side's typical game.
Similarly, favourites in the biggest upsets can be forced into a more chaotic game than they would like.
In the Tigers' victory over the Blues, their ascendancy came as the ball started to spill to the deck more.
As Carlton lost the ability to soak up pressure and smoothly progress the ball down the field, the upset became more likely.
The stress release of a slow march up the ground ending in a score was removed by hyperactive Richmond defence, ultimately leaving Carlton frustrated.
""As the game went, you could see Richmond clearly were gathering more energy,"" Voss said.
""Sometimes you just have to stay in that fight when things aren't working for you.""
Most coaches like to explain two things when given the chance: pressure and territory.
If you get the ball up your end more often than the other team, then you have a fair chance of winning. If you can't do that, make sure you limit the scoring chances from those inside-50 entries.
Getting more inside 50s than your opponent matches up strongly with victory in most games. Territory is not only a key part of how teams score but also how they prevent opposition goals.
In big upset wins, though, that relationship partially breaks down.
In upsets, the underdogs are usually still burdened with a deficit of territory to overcome. That means the second part of the picture — pressure — is so important.
In the last few years, teams generally raise their tackle efforts in wins compared to other matches.
But the biggest upsets see a higher rate of tackles for the victors than in ordinary games. This likely contributes to a drop in accuracy and efficiency when going inside 50.
""We play full team defence, so our forwards were really important in that and we played a really strong — [it] looked like we played a strong — brand on defence,"" Yze said after the win over the Blues.
The Tigers brought the pressure as the match wore on, just as they brought more of the game to the ground. Whenever the Blues got the ball, it seemed they were surrounded by an ambush of Tigers.
In the last quarter, the Blues managed 19 inside 50s to just eight from the Tigers. They had the ball in their half 83 per cent of the time in the last 20 minutes but lost the match in that period.
Across the entire match, the Tigers had 25 fewer inside 50s than the Blues but managed to lay six more tackles, evidence of the push-pull on display.
Carlton and Richmond fans will frantically try to understand if round one suggests a bigger change in fortunes, or if it's just a lightning strike of good — or bad — luck.
An interesting picture emerges from the 25 biggest early-season upsets in recent years. While plenty were just blips without bigger meaning, quite a few turned out to be ""false"" upsets.
Some were an early sign of rising strength and others indicated emerging struggles at an assumed contender.
Of those teams causing upsets, a quarter eventually finished higher than the fancied opponent on the ladder, and only one-third of the time did the ladder gap between the two sides surpass five wins.
Some concern from Carlton fans might be well held as only half of the early-beaten favourites finished the season with winning records.
Storied collapses like Fremantle in 2016, Adelaide in 2018 and Melbourne in 2019 were signalled by early boilovers. So too were rises to finals by Collingwood in 2018 and Sydney in 2021.
Carlton has also lived this story before.
In early 2012, the Blues were brought back to earth by Essendon in a match widely assumed to be a foregone conclusion.
Months later, both sides were all square on the ladder and Carlton parted ways with Brett Ratten after the season.
Carlton's 2012 campaign also saw another boilover when they lost to the Suns, who collected just their third win of the season.
And you'd be right if you thought that the start of the season was the most likely place to see big upsets.
However, early-season upsets usually aren't as big in nature as what we saw last week. The frequency of upsets drops off as the season unfolds.
Footy is forever unpredictable and the truly out-of-the-box results never go away. Wild upsets can happen anytime, but they peak in the third quarter of the season.
For Carlton fans, they'll be hoping last week was a glitch, while their Richmond counterparts will cling to the belief this was the first sign of their next premiership team.
For all neutral footy fans who love a surprise, they just hope another big upset is around the corner.",ABC News,sports
"Nick Kyrgios wins on ATP Tour for first time since 2022, joins Aussie number one Kimberly Birrell in second round at Miami Open",Nick Kyrgios the player underlines his quality even in defeat,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-20/sport-kim-birrell-wins-in-miami-open/105074348,"Australia's Nick Kyrgios has recovered from a slow start to beat American Mackenzie McDonald in the first round of the Miami Open.
Kyrgios dropped the opening set before storming home to win 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 on Wednesday, local time.
The win was his first in a tour-level match since 2022 and sets up a second-round encounter with Russian Karen Khachanov.
The Australian is glad to be back but will not be getting carried away.
""To come off and get a win and feel like I belong again was special,"" he said.
""I never thought I would play tennis again to be brutally honest with you.
""I was having conversations with my camp and my team … and I said, 'I don't know how long I can keep doing this for.'
""This [win] puts some petrol in the tank but I need to be realistic and see how my wrist feels tomorrow because it is a grind out here.""
Nick Kyrgios is one of the most entertaining tennis players on the planet. In his singles defeat to Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard, he showed his ability as a player, too.
The 2022 Wimbledon finalist, who once reached 13 in the ATP Tour rankings, currently sits at 892.
He came into the Miami tournament after an early exit at Indian Wells where he retired hurt in his opening match.
The Australian was losing 7-6, 3-0 to Botic van de Zandschulp before quitting with a wrist injury.
The win also comes after the Australian was named as one of the plaintiffs in a lawsuit filed by the Professional Tennis Players' Association (PTPA) against the sport's governing bodies, accusing them of anti-competitive practices and a disregard for player welfare.
The PTPA, an independent players' union co-founded by Novak Djokovic and Vasek Pospisil in 2019, says after years of good-faith efforts to reform professional tennis it has been forced to take legal action to end ""monopolistic control"" of the sport.
In its sights are the ATP and WTA, which organise the men's and women's tours, the International Tennis Federation, which runs team competitions, and the International Tennis Integrity Agency, which oversees the sport's anti-doping and anti-corruption system.
Twelve current and former players, including Djokovic, Pospisil and Kyrgios, are listed as plaintiffs along with the PTPA.
Also recording wins in round one were Tristan Schoolkate, who beat Ethan Quinn 6-0, 6-2, and Rinky Hijikata, who edged Hamad Medjedovic 7-5, 3-6, 7-5.
Aleksandar Vukic though lost to Belgian veteran David Goffin 2-6, 6-4, 6-2 and Chris O'Connell lost in agonising fashion to Spaniard Roberto Carballés Baena, 6-3, 3-6, 7-6 (7-5).

Kim Birrell is the last Australian woman left standing in the Miami Open draw, battling ferociously to save a match point en route to a resilient three-set opening-round victory over Anastasia Potapova.
With Ajla Tomljanović getting knocked out by US qualifier Bernarda Pera, Queensland-based Birrell, who's risen to her highest ever ranking of 68, is left flying the flag in the women's draw after another notable win against a player ranked 30 places above her.
Birrell, who's had to qualify to get into a third successive WTA 1000 main draw, defeated Potapova for the second time in two months after defeating the Russian in the Brisbane International in straight sets in January en route to her first WTA 500 quarterfinal.
Wednesday's win, though, was a much more tortuous affair, as the 26-year-old Aussie had to battle back from a set down, then a match point down, before finally outstaying Potapova 3-6, 6-3, 7-6 (7-5) after 2 hours, 23 minutes.
Despite seeming marginally the better player for much of a close contest against an opponent with more firepower, Birrell looked finally to have been cracked at the end of the third set when a costly double fault helped Potapova into a break and a 5-3 lead.

But serving for the match and two points away from victory, the 23-year-old Russian was rocked by Birrell's terrific drive volley that earned the break back.
In the next game, Birrrell went 30-40 down only to produce a big serve to save match point before going on to take the set into a deciding breaker with an ace that left Potapova so frustrated that she chucked her racquet down in disgust.
The Australian was 2-0 down in the tiebreak too but proved the more solid of the pair, grabbing her chance on her first match point at 6-5, when Potapova planted a backhand into the net.
It set up a tough second-round meeting for Birrell with 22-year-old Ukrainian Marta Kostyuk, the number 23 seed, and she'll need to do better than serving up the nine double faults that made life so difficult against Potapova.
Tomljanović's hopes of making progress in her 11th Miami Open campaign at a tournament where she's enjoyed some success, were soon dashed by 30-year-old left-hander Pera, who ran out 6-3 6-2 winner in just an hour and a quarter.

Players' group founded by Novak Djokovic files antitrust suit against tennis organisers,independent players' union co-founded by Novak Djokovic in 2019,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-19/novak-djokovic-tennis-group-sues-governing-bodies/105069284,"The Professional Tennis Players' Association (PTPA) has filed a lawsuit against the sport's governing bodies, accusing them of anti-competitive practices and a disregard for player welfare.
The PTPA, an independent players' union co-founded by Novak Djokovic in 2019, said on Tuesday that after years of good-faith efforts to reform professional tennis, it had been forced to take legal action to end ""monopolistic control"" of the sport.
In a statement, it said that along with more than a dozen players, the PTPA had filed papers in a New York court against the ATP Tour, the WTA Tour, the International Tennis Federation (ITF) and the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA).
Among those players with their names attached to the lawsuit is Nick Kyrgios, as well as Romania's Sorana Cîrstea, Russia-born French player Varvara Gracheva and Americans Reilly Opelka, Tennys Sandgren and Nicole Melichar-Martinez.
Djokovic is not named in the lawsuit.
PTPA executive director Ahmad Nassar said Djokovic was ""certainly very involved, very up to speed. He is still a sitting member of our executive committee at the PTPA … This is about much more than one player"".

""Beyond just the economics, we see … player welfare is completely disregarded in everything, from the tour schedule to anti-competitive practices, to abusing our rights around name, image, likeness,"" co-founder of the PTPA Vasek Pospisil, who is also listed as a plaintiff, said.
""Tennis is broken,"" Nassar said in a statement.
""Behind the glamorous veneer that the defendants promote, players are trapped in an unfair system that exploits their talent, suppresses their earnings and jeopardises their health and safety.
Tennis players are playing more often, in more locations around the world than ever before. This ""ridiculous"" schedule is looming as the sport's biggest threat.
""We have exhausted all options for reform through dialogue, and the governing bodies have left us no choice but to seek accountability through the courts. Fixing these systemic failures isn't about disrupting tennis, it's about saving it for the generations of players and fans to come.""
In response, the ATP accused the PTPA of choosing ""division and distraction"" and having no meaningful role in the sport.
""We strongly reject the premise of the PTPA's claims, believe the case to be entirely without merit, and will vigorously defend our position,"" the ATP said in a statement.
""ATP remains committed to working in the best interests of the game — towards continued growth, financial stability and the best possible future for players, tournaments, and fans.""
The WTA defended its record of growing women's tennis, describing the lawsuit as ""baseless"".
""Every decision taken at the WTA board level includes the input of players via their elected board representatives, and athletes receive substantial financial rewards and other benefits from participation in the WTA,"" the organisation said.

Describing the various governing bodies as ""a cartel"", the PTPA, which has also begun legal action in Britain and the EU, accuses them of paying ""artificially low compensation to professional tennis players"" and imposing a ""draconian"" ranking system that forces them to compete in certain tournaments.
The lawsuit calls the schedule unsustainable, says players are made to play in extreme heat and often in the early hours of the morning, that tennis balls chosen by the tournaments are a factor in chronic injuries and that players' privacy rights are being abused by random drug tests.
ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.
Prior to filing the lawsuit, the PTPA said it met with more than 250 players across the tours, including the majority of the men's and women's top 20.
""The overwhelmingly positive player feedback was a resounding confirmation — change is needed now, and players are united in their fight for reform,"" the statement said.
Serbia's 24-time grand slam champion Djokovic has been a fierce advocate for change to the organisation of tennis, insisting that the revenues generated by the sport were not fairly shared with players.
""Women and men who are around 200 and lower-ranked in the world, they are struggling a lot,"" he said in a CBS 60 Minutes interview in 2023.
""They can't afford a coach, they can't afford travels, they skip tournaments, many of them leave tennis who are super talented and maybe capable of reaching great heights.""
The ITIA, which manages the sport's anti-doping and anti-corruption programmes, responded, saying: ""Any credible international sport requires robust anti-doping and anti-corruption programmes, and we are proud of our role in contributing to a clean and fair sport.""

Ex-Australian rugby captain Rocky Elsom handed two-year jail term in France for misusing corporate assets,Ex-Wallabies captain reportedly facing international arrest warrant,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-15/ex-australian-ruby-captain-rocky-elsom-given-jail-sentence/105055358,"Former Australia rugby captain Rocky Elsom has been handed a two-year jail sentence in France after misusing corporate funds during his time as club president of Narbonne.
French authorities have been forced to issue a warrant for his arrest after the 42-year-old did not show up in court on Friday, local time.
He was also fined 100,000 euros ($172, 200) with half the sum suspended.
Elsom was president of southern French club Narbonne from 2015-16.
He went on trial for embezzling club funds by making unjustified expenditures to pay a coach or a general manager who was living in Australia at the time.
He was acquitted on charges of forgery and use of forgery but was ordered to pay 230,000 euros in compensation to the club's liquidator.
His lawyer Yann Le Bras appealed.
Rocky Elsom developed a reputation as a stand-out flanker during his career playing for Australia.

During a trial last month, the prosecutor requested a three-year prison sentence and a fine of 630,000 euros.
Elsom's lawyer had pleaded for an acquittal.
In a previous trial in October last year, Elsom was sentenced to five years in prison but did not attend the hearing.
He has been the subject of an international arrest warrant since that conviction.
As allowed by French law, Elsom requested to be retried with legal representation, but he did not appear in court last month.
French authorities said that his whereabouts were unknown before issuing the warrant.
Elsom played 75 times for Australia from 2005-11.
He was named man of the match when he won the 2009 European Cup with Dublin-based Irish club Leinster alongside Ireland greats Johnny Sexton and Brian O'Driscoll.
He had been living in Ireland since August 2024 and fled the country after an international arrest warrant was issued against him.
He denied any wrongdoing and said that under his leadership Narbonne was in a healthy position.
French media is reporting an international arrest warrant has been issued for Rocky Elsom — who captained the Wallabies between 2009 and 2011 — over his conduct as president of rugby union club Narbonne.
""(Narbonne) achieved solid profits, had good sporting results, and remained in Pro D2 (the second tier of French rugby) until 2016 and beyond,"" he said in a statement in October last year.
""It seems that I have been targeted as a scapegoat for the future mismanagement of this famous rugby club.""
Narbonne won the French Championship twice in 1936 and 1979 and finished runner-up three times. The club went into liquidation in 2018 and now competes in the third-tier Fédérale league.
Elsom had been working as a coach at a school in Dublin around the time of his arrest warrant.
He said in an interview four months ago on YouTube that he left immediately with only a single backpack when he found out that Ireland was legally obliged to extradite him to France.
When he gave the interview to Mark Bouris from a hidden location, he said he had not been informed there was a public trial in October.
""This is a really important part of it. I didn't know a court case was on and there was no possible way for me to know,"" he said.

Collingwood pips Footscray as Steele Sidebottom and Magpies break Bulldogs hearts on centenary night,"Thu, 20 Mar6080→",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-21/afl-round-two-footscray-bulldogs-vs-collingwood-live-blog/105083300,"Collingwood has crashed Footscray's 100-year party, claiming a thrilling six-point victory at the MCG to land its second win on the bounce.
The Bulldogs, fuelled by emotion and star turns from famous Footscray names in Sam Darcy and Tom Liberatore, jumped to an early 22-point lead, before Collingwood got into the game.
Adopting their old name for the evening, the Bulldogs hung in until Steele Sidebottom's late snap sealed a 10.16 (76) to 10.10 (70) win.

""Credit to the Bulldogs, I thought they played really, really well,"" Magpies coach Craig McRae said.
""Got a lot of their best players out and they just fought right to the last bit, which challenged us.
""It's just nice to have a new version of us but still have those tight wins and know what to do in those tight situations.""
The crowd of 78,027 was an all-time home attendance record for the Bulldogs, celebrating a century in the VFL/AFL.
Defender Reef McInnes was substituted inside the opening 10 minutes with a suspected ruptured anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee.

Mason Cox came off in the fourth quarter after Rory Lobb caught him flush in the face with a late spoil.
Collingwood midfielder Jack Crisp could come under match review officer scrutiny for a first-quarter sling tackle on Bulldog Rhylee West.
Nick Daicos (39 disposals) was magnificent, while Pendlebury (26 touches) and Josh Daicos (25) were busy.
With Marcus Bontempelli, Adam Treloar, Cody Weightman, Jamarra Ugle-Hagan and Liam Jones sidelined, it was another gallant effort from Luke Beveridge's Bulldogs.
Look back at how the action unfolded in our live blog.

Can you feel the love at the MCG? It's been an emotional night, but most importantly we got a game of footy befitting the occasion.
If we get many better games than this year, we'll be lucky footy fans indeed. Thanks for keeping me company tonight, and I look forward to seeing you tomorrow arvo as we get Saturday's action up and running. See you then!
By Dean Bilton
Based on tonight’s performance do you think Collingwood will feature in September?
- Mick
Three weeks ago, Collingwood was my tip for the flag.
I'm not sure how comfortable I am with that pick at the moment, but I would certainly be very surprised if they didn't figure in September, and the Pies are the sort of team that can catch fire for a month and blow the league away. Might be all about timing.
By Dean Bilton
For the 308th time in the AFL, Steele Sidebottom and Scott Pendlebury leave the field together. Importantly for them, they do so as winners.
These two actually switched jerseys after the game too, which I'm not sure I've ever seen two teammates do before. SP22 just doesn't look right.
Pendlebury chatted to Fox Footy to talk through their relationship.
""It was nice to see Steele kick the sealer.
""I'm the nerd. I think everyone knows that, but as Sidey says I've loosened up a bit in the last few years.
""It was a really enjoyable contest, and we found ourselves on the right side of the result.
""Any time we can run in numbers and try to get the ball past their zone and attack their last line, it looked dangerous for us.""
By Dean Bilton
I'm not sure how Bulldogs fans will be feeling tonight, but I hope pride is underpinning all of it. The Dogs are missing a handful of genuine star players, not least their captain Marcus Bontempelli, but tonight found other ways to take it up to another very good team.
Not sure there's much else I can say about Sam Darcy. He'll be the best player in the league within two or three years, there is not way any other human being can stop him when he's in full flight. I thought Ed Richards was really good, Joel Freijah too, and Rory Lobb played an excellent game in defence (until he left one on Mason Cox).
Buku Khamis was good, Sam Davidson was good, Ryley Sanders and Harvey Gallagher were decent. It's going to be a slog for a few more weeks while the injury list remains long, but if these Dogs can hang in there until the guns come back the future is bright.
By Dean Bilton
In case there was every any doubt (there wasn't), Steele Sidebottom has still got it. This here was the match-winning goal.
By Dean Bilton
It's a seismic Collingwood win, the kind the Magpies built their rise to the 2023 premiership around. Full of guts, full of class and with those same champion players stepping up with the game on the line.
Steele Sidebottom is the match-winner, Nick Daicos and Scott Pendlebury were tremendous. It took them right until the final despairing moments, but the Magpies emerged victorious.
It's going to be so tough for the Bulldogs to swallow, carrying with them all the history of Footscray and the collective will of every player and person who made the club what it is today. It wasn't to be, but not through any lack of spirit or quality. With so many stars on the sidelines, another in Sam Darcy soared higher than anyone else on the field tonight.
The Dogs were brave, the Magpies were too good. It was a truly wonderful game of football, a joy to watch.
By Dean Bilton
The Pies have survived one attack, but can the Dogs force one more? Now or never.
By Dean Bilton
The ball is chipped around as the Magpies take some time off the clock.
Dogs need to win and take off. Maybe one last chance for Footscray.
By Dean Bilton
The draw is a live result now as a Dogs behind makes it a six-point margin. Two minutes to play.
By Dean Bilton
He had a moment he'd like to forget a few moments ago, but all is forgiven now as the veteran bobs up in a forward 50 stoppage to gather and snap an enormous Collingwood goal.
It's seven points now for the Pies with only 3:25 on the clock. Is that that?
By Dean Bilton
Every look on goal going to be critical now, and that one has gone begging for Jordan De Goey. From 30 out on a tight angle he misses to the near side.
One point margin, Collingwood leads.
By Dean Bilton
Oh boy, you haven't heard a bigger Bulldogs roar since Tom Boyd dobbed one from just about the same spot nine years ago!
Steele Sidebottom heard the traffic coming and bailed out of the contest in a moment he will never want to see again, and from that Freijah took off. He scythed through the centre square, got to the top of the 50 and nailed it.
It's a tie game. It feels like September in the middle of March.
By Dean Bilton
First the spoil with the flight to deny Dan McStay the mark, and then the full-length dive to get a fingernail on McStay's kick off the ground.
That is inspirational from the Bulldogs defender. They are a team possessed, but still six points down and under attack.
By Dean Bilton
I think that was a genuine attempt at a spoil on the ball as Cox marked, but Lobb has absolutely flushed Cox in the jaw with as clean a jab as you will ever see.
Accidental or not, that is nasty. Cox is bleeding and off the field, but hopefully that is the full extent of it.
By Dean Bilton
It's Darcy, West and Liberatore, leading the Bulldogs like it's the 1990s all over again!
Sam Davidson was so composed in the centre to get the ball forward, then those three famous names combined to get Libba a telling snap on goal.
They're coming! The Bulldogs are on the charge at the MCG!
By Dean Bilton
He's their only way home, but with the Bulldogs fighting like hell just to stay alive in this one, Sam Darcy might yet prove a matchwinner.
The ball movement was laboured from the Dogs that time, eventually ending in a pretty speculative kick forward in Darcy's general direction. That's all it takes right now, he can mark anything. He's a phenom.
By Dean Bilton
There is the first goal of the quarter, and it comes for Collingwood in blistering fashion.
A turnover at half-forward proved devastating for the Bulldogs, as Mason Cox set up a chip-and-chase opportunity for Hill into an open 50. Davidson put everything he had into the chase but couldn't make up an inch.
Hill dribbles through the goal and the Pies lead by 14.
By Dean Bilton
We're off and running for the final term of what has been an engrossing game, about as good as we've seen so far this season.
First goal is critical. The Bulldogs have subbed Artie Jones out for Oskar Baker.
By Dean Bilton
That was Collingwood's quarter, but not to the extent that game has been taken away from Footscray. For that reason you'd have to thing the Bulldogs are pretty happy going into the last turn.
But the Pies did look to have more running in that quarter which is cause for Bulldogs concern. As the game opens up, Collingwood is finding an advantage. But if it remains a contested, straight-line, keep it in the air clash in the last then the Dogs have the weapons to run over the top.
Impossible to tip from here. Big last quarter awaits.",ABC News,sports
Why 'cricket equals life' for technicolour commentator Bharat Sundaresan,Leisa Scott,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-02-23/why-cricket-equals-life-for-commentator-bharat-sundaresan/104695086,"There's a reason cricket commentator Bharat Sundaresan lives his life with gusto, donning technicolour outfits paired with painted fingernails and a radiant smile.
He knows the high-profile, successful life he has now in Australia, the period he calls his ""second innings,"" came close to being a duck.
He could be dead.
Bharat says he ""owes a lot"" to cricket. (Australian Story: Erin Semmler)
He could have been hauled out in a body bag that day he overdosed on party drugs in his chaotic hometown of Mumbai, just as the then 21-year-old was about to embark on the journey to becoming an internationally renowned cricket journalist.
""People often ask me, 'Why do you smile all the time, why are you happy all the time?',"" Bharat, now 39, tells Australian Story. ""And I'm like, 'Dude, every morning I wake up is one more day than I deserve to live'.""
""The more colour the better"": Bharat says living in Australia has helped him finally feel comfortable in his own skin. (Australian Story: Erin Semmler)
Bharat has built a beautiful life in the Adelaide Hills with his wife, Isha, and two spoilt dogs, Olivia and Alfred. (Australian Story: Erin Semmler)
It was his farewell party before he left Mumbai for Chennai, on the opposite coast of India. For three years, he'd been drifting, hanging out with his heavy-metal band mates as they kidded themselves they were practising for gigs. The truth was, Bharat was getting high most days, a crutch for the confusion in his life.
Bharat felt like an outsider in India. He baulked at the rules, the divisions imposed by the caste-based society, the expected conformity.
He'd grow his sleek, black hair long until his brother, with whom he had a volatile relationship, marched him to the barber to have it sheared off.
He liked colourful clothes but his parents thought them flashy. ""My parents would ask, 'Why do you want to be different?' And I would try to tell them, 'I'm not trying to be different. I'm just trying to be myself'.""
Chennai would be his escape. He'd been accepted into a journalism course, a job he knew little about but someone said he might be able to write about cricket — the one constant in Bharat's muddled life — and that was reason enough.
Bharat ""emerged a whole new person"" after his near-death experience. (Australian Story: Erin Semmler)
On the night of his farewell, he partied hard, popping a medley of pills like he'd done many times before.
This time, things went weird. His hands no longer obeyed him, as if taken over by some outside force. He felt like he was sinking. His heartbeat slowed and through the haze, Bharat realised he'd overdosed.
""And all I remember thinking is, 'That's it, I'm going to die a loser',"" Bharat says.
June 11, 2007, is etched in Bharat's mind, the day he swore off drugs after pulling through the near-death experience. ""This new person … emerged out of it; completely different, completely at peace with himself,"" he says.
He'd graduate, get married, get a job with The Indian Express as a cricket writer, break some big stories. But his second innings really kicked off after moving to Australia in late 2018, with the unflinching support of his wife, Isha Chatterjee.
""Australia feels so close to my heart,"" Bharat says. ""It's allowed me to find something that I never could find in India, which is me. I found myself in this country. I owe a lot to Australia.""

Today, Bharat is one of the world's most recognisable and well-regarded cricket writers and commentators. Australian Test captain, Pat Cummins, says he's drawn to Bharat not only because of his deep love of cricket but his inquisitiveness about how the world works.
Test batsman, Marnus Labuschagne, admires Bharat's intense study of cricket. ""He always goes that level above trying to find out more about the game rather than reporting on results,"" Labuschagne says.

Broadcaster and former India head coach, Ravi Shastri, says he is an ""absolute professional"".
""He's got the trust of the Australian cricket team as well. He's watching coaches. He's watching support staff. He's watching techniques, rhythm … and he writes beautifully.""
Bharat is renowned for spending hours at the practice nets, watching every step, every telltale move of the shoulder of the Australian cricketers. You can't miss him — he'll be the long-haired dude in the multicoloured outfit, sometimes matching, often not.
And unless he's being challenged by an overzealous — or racist — security guard about his right to be on the grounds, he'll be smiling.
The first thing Bharat remembers is cricket. He was five and watching a televised test match between India and West Indies as a blistering fast bowler from Jamaica hurtled down the field.
""Two things happen in that moment,"" Bharat says. ""I was hooked onto cricket … and I became a lifelong West Indies nut.""

By the time he was seven, he was ""The Stats Guru"", the local kid who could be called upon to rattle off who scored what, when and where. If he was ill, he'd give his mother updates in cricket terminology. ""Oh, we're seven wickets down,"" he'd say from his sick bed.
Bharat (pictured with his brother) would tell his parents he wasn't trying to be ""different"" he was ""just trying to be myself"". (Supplied: Bharat Sundaresan)
Cricket was one way the extroverted kid with a penchant for the dramatic could blend in. He loves India's passion for the game — but bristles at calling it a religion.
""Religion divides people in India,"" he says. ""Cricket is what unites people.""
And it saved his life, he says, the lifeline that pulled him through after the overdose.
""Cricket is as much a part of me as I think anything in life … Because it did save my life. It kept me alive,"" Bharat says.
His other lifeline is his wife, Isha Chatterjee. The rise and rise of Bharat — from fledgling journalist to international cricket correspondent, broadcaster and author — cannot be separated from Chatterjee.
They met on the first day of college. He was captivated. She was freaked out. ""Bharat walks up to me,"" recalls Isha, ""and he said: 'I think you're the most beautiful woman I have ever met. And I was just like, 'Oh, creep alert!'.""
Bharat says the relationship developed ""organically"". (Supplied: Bharat Sundaresan)
But they became friends, a friendship that blossomed when both scored their first jobs in journalism in Mumbai (or Bombay as Bharat still refers to it as). Fate intervened when Isha's lodgings fell through and Bharat suggested she board at his home. Over time, they became a couple.
""It's not the most romantic of stories,"" Bharat says. ""[Our relationship] happened so organically that we don't even have a starting date.""
They're different. Isha, who left journalism to become a special needs teacher and artist, is an introvert, more at home alone, working in her studio than in large groups. Bharat is loud, extroverted and makes friends easily.
""He'll go make friends with a door,"" Isha says, deadpan.
But Isha also rebelled against the expectations of Indian society. ""We always got the finger wag because we just always questioned,"" Isha says. ""We always wanted to be who we want to be and wanted to break those norms, wanted to explore things.""
Isha says it's been a joy to watch her husband flourish in Australia. (Supplied: Bharat Sundaresan)
It was Isha who led the way to Australia. They hatched a plan: she'd head over first to study a master's in special education and Bharat would follow when he could make it work.
Isha landed in Adelaide in February 2017, walked out the airport and thought, ""Oh my god, what have I done?"". She was homesick, lonely and ""wanted a hug"". In two years, the couple saw each other for just two weeks, when Bharat visited.
But come 2018, Bharat became the first Indian to be a foreign correspondent on Australian cricket after being offered a job with the leading Indian cricket website, Cricbuzz, which boasts more than 150 million mobile app downloads.
Bharat says Isha made it all possible. ""I always tell people it was the easiest move ever,"" he says. ""I had a wife who still wanted me to come and live with her. She had a house she was renting. She bought a car.""
Together, they've made the Adelaide Hills and Australia home. Isha encourages her husband's colourful style, even sharing her clothes — the bright ones — with him.
""It’s not a case of falling in love 12 years ago, it’s about falling in love every day for the last 12 years,"" Bharat  says of the relationship. (Australian Story: Erin Semmler)
She's the one sending him design ideas for his painted fingernails. It's been a joy, says Isha, to watch her husband flourish.
""I always knew Bharat was very special,"" she says. ""Moving to Australia has just given him the freedom to be himself. He's always been a great journalist but here, he's just found himself.
Bharat loves living in his community in the Adelaide hills. (Australian Story: Erin Semmler)
It was Bharat's fifth summer working as a cricket journalist in Australia when a security guard challenged him as he entered the Melbourne Cricket Ground.
It wasn't the first time. The accredited journalist had been stopped at other major ovals by guards, buffeted with a variety of snide and subtly racist remarks.
This time, Bharat didn't shrug it off with a joke. He snapped back, then fired off a tweet, telling security guards that at some point, they had to stop questioning his credentials and whether they could trust him.
The tweet went viral. Then, the Sydney Morning Herald asked him to write about his experiences of racism — the times he's been called a terrorist, the way people cross the road when they see him — and the debate took off.
Bharat is glad he wrote it. He says the reaction was largely supportive — people stopped him in the street to thank him, or apologise, and the cricket fraternity, including high-profile former and current players, rose to hug him and shake his hand at the MCG.
There was blowback, too, but Bharat argues he was not trying to bag Australia but to say, ""Come on Australia, you can do better"".
""I realised that, especially now that I have a voice, what's the point of having a voice if I'm not going to use it,"" he says. ""I poured my heart out into it.""
Because his heart is now with Australia. He'll always hold India close, but Australia is home now, where Bharat can be himself, where he belongs.
Bharat has built a rapport with fellow journalists and cricketers alike including names like Pat Cummins and Marnus Labuschagne. (Australian Story: Erin Semmler)
Bharat's approach to his work is to, ""Do a job, put smiles on faces and go back home"". (Australian Story: Erin Semmler)
And in January, he started the process of making that official. Bharat has taken his Australian citizenship test, while Isha has taken the pledge to become an Australian citizen, something the couple called ""one of the happiest days of our lives"".
""This country has done so much, so many wonders for us,"" Bharat says. ""Does it have its issues? Which country doesn't have its issues?! I want to not just be Australian just for being an Australian. I think I can make a difference.""
Bharat, who loves spending time with his nieces, said ""Australia is my forever home"". (Australian Story: Erin Semmler)

McReight injury presents Wallabies with 'what if' scenario ahead of Lions tour,Lions watch: France win Six Nations,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-17/super-rugby-pacific-round-5-reds-waratahs-brumbies-force/105058296,"The Queensland Reds ended the NSW Waratahs' unbeaten streak with a 35—15 victory in Brisbane to sit third on the Super Rugby Pacific standings.
The Brumbies are one position behind following their 38—21 defeat of Fijian Drua in Canberra, while the Western Force went down 55—33 to the Crusaders in Christchurch.
As players continue to jostle for berths in Joe Schmidt's Wallabies squad to face the British and Irish Lions, here are some of the talking points from round five of Super Rugby Pacific.
It appears the Wallabies' worst fears won't be realised, with Fraser McReight's shoulder injury not considered a long-term concern at this stage.
McReight finished the Reds' match against the Waratahs on the sidelines wearing a sling after sustaining an AC joint injury when scoring a try in the second half.
He was set to be rested from the Reds' next match against the Highlanders in Dunedin on Saturday, although it's uncertain if he will be available to play the Force in Brisbane the following weekend.
With the Lions series approaching, Wallabies fans have reason to breathe a sigh of relief, but it begs the question: how would Schmidt cover for McReight at openside flanker if it had been a season-ending injury?
It's a 'what if 'scenario ABC Sport touched upon earlier this season, but worth re-visiting in case McReight's shoulder injury does end up becoming a lingering issue.
McReight is among the few Wallabies who could be considered one of the best in the world for their positions.
He is a menace at defensive breakdowns and a valuable link player in attack.
Carlo Tizzano has been outstanding for the Force this season and would be the closest 'like for like' replacement for McReight.

Brumbies duo Rory Scott and Luke Reimer are also capable back-ups.
Scott has started at seven and Reimer used from the bench for the Brumbies successfully in their past two matches, which may give Schmidt an idea about how to shape his match-day squad.
The Waratahs' Charlie Gamble is another openside flanker who has impressed so far in Super Rugby Pacific.
Christchurch-born Gamble fits the mould of a traditional Australian 'jackal', playing hard over the ball at the breakdown with a massive amount of energy.
Despite the Waratahs' loss, Gamble put in a solid shift against the Reds and his 'hustle' shouldn't go unnoticed.
The Reds earned bragging rights and retained the Bob Templeton Cup with their convincing win over the Waratahs.
Gone are the days when Reds-Waratahs matches served as virtual Wallabies selection trials, with the Australian rugby landscape having expanded in the professional era.
ABC Sport will live blog the Wallabies vs British and Irish Lions series in July and August
But Saturday night's encounter gave several Reds players, who would be considered fringe candidates to make the Wallabies match-day squad, the opportunity to show their wares against a domestic opponent.
Blindside flanker Seru Uru and lock Josh Canham gave strong performances, as did outside centre Filipo Daugunu, although his best chance of Test selection will be as a winger.

Among the Reds' established Wallabies, Harry Wilson and Tate McDermott didn't leap off the page, nor did they tarnish their reputations.
Wilson made 22 tackles and crossed the chalk when he bumped off Joey Walton close to the line, but the Wallabies captain needs more impact with his ball carries in attack.
He also coughed up possession three times in contact, an area of his game that needs attention ahead of the Reds facing the Highlanders.
If fit, Len Ikitau should be one of the first selected when the Wallabies squad is chosen for the opening Lions Test in July.
The three tries he scored against the Drua on Friday night illustrated some of his key strengths, such as physicality in contact and an instinctive attacking game.

Ikitau knows when to run the ball himself and can be damaging in close-range situations, with Brumbies coach Stephen Larkham describing his charge as ""pretty much unstoppable"".
The squad for the upcoming Lions tour of Australia is looking clearer after a wild night of results in the Six Nations.
His support play is excellent, as he showed when he touched down for his third try in the second half.
On the defensive side of the ball, Ikitau is the Brumbies' backline anchor and it wasn't surprising to hear Larkham showering further praise on the 39-Test international after the match.
""I regard Len as the best defensive outside centre in the world,"" Larkham told the assembled media in Canberra.
The reference to ""outside centre"" is interesting, perhaps suggesting Larkham believes Ikitau should be picked for the Wallabies in his preferred position.
Ikitau was used at inside centre to accommodate Joseph-Aukuso Suaalii in the number 13 jersey in three of the Wallabies' four Tests on last year's spring tour.
With the sidelined Suaalii (toe injury) running out of time to press his claims for the Wallabies' fullback role, Ikitau may again play inside centre against the Lions.
Noah Lolesio made his return for the Brumbies against the Drua after missing three matches due to concussion.
As expected, Lolesio was rusty at fly half following a month on the sidelines, although he still showed glimpses of his ability to direct the Brumbies attack.
He re-joins the race to play 10 for the Wallabies, a role he held down in 11 of their 13 Tests last year.

The Force's Ben Donaldson has been the best Australian fly half this season and Tom Lynagh continues to show promise for the Reds, but neither is kicking down the door of Wallabies selectors.
Another highly touted contender, Tane Edmed, has been relegated to bench duties behind Lawson Creighton for the Waratahs after underwhelming displays in his two starts against the Highlanders and Drua.
Lolesio has been an inconsistent performer at Test level since debuting in 2020, however Schmidt clearly backs his game management skills, even if a sizeable number of Wallabies supporters don't share the faith.
The Super Rugby Pacific season has a long way to go, giving Lolesio the opportunity to turn some doubters into believers.
The possibility of James O'Connor returning to the Wallabies is remote, but his effort off the bench for the Crusaders against the Force showed the value of his experience.
O'Connor replaced Taha Kemara at fly half in the 50th minute when the Crusaders — leading 27—21 — had yet to put the Force to the sword.
He made an early impact with a clever 'show and go' on a second man play, before delivering a well-executed wide ball to Will Jordan in the lead-up to one of Macca Springer's five tries.

The shape he brought to the Crusaders' attack was highlighted by retired All Blacks scrum half, Justin Marshall.
""He (O'Connor) plays more at the line, a lot flatter than what Taha Kemara does, and that allows the ability for him to bring defenders in so they can't push out off him … if he's deep, they can,"" Marshall said in commentary on New Zealand's Sky Network.
""I just think he's certainly allowing them (Crusaders) to attack in a different way when he's on the field, engaging defenders as a first receiver.""
This column has previously suggested it would be a significant call if Schmidt included O'Connor in his squad for the Lions series.
It's a long shot, but the 34-year-old remains a bench option for the Wallabies, given his versatility to cover almost every backline position.
His vast Test experience and previous appearances against the Lions would also be of benefit in a mentoring role to whoever starts at fly half.",ABC News,sports
Cooma Titans cricket team brings 'infectious' spirit to Snowy Mountains,Floss Adams,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-21/cooma-titans-cricket-team-country-tournament-revival/105061526,"Most cricket bats and balls lie dormant during the biting winter in New South Wales' Snowy Mountains.
But that is not the case for a group of dedicated cricket teams who continue playing in the cold off-season in Cooma.
""Even when it was minus three, minus four [degrees Celsius] you could walk past one of the ovals in town and they were playing cricket,"" said the president of the Monaro District Cricket Association, Nathan Thompson.
The source of that ""infectious"" enthusiasm can be found in the roots of the alpine region's newest team, made up of mostly Indian and Pakistani cricketers.
Captain of the Cooma Titans and club president Mirza ""Zee"" Zeeshan said he is ""crazy about cricket"", but that was completely normal in his birth country of Pakistan.
""It's enormous. Everybody loves cricket,"" he said.

During his first week living in the Cooma area Mr Zeeshan's passion for cricket was reinvigorated when he watched a local game being played.
""It wakes up a lot of things from the past,"" he said.
Alongside hundreds of other migrant worker families Mr Zeeshan and his family moved to the Snowy Mountains to work for Snowy 2.0, the project expanding the Snowy Hydro scheme.
There are currently 45 cultural backgrounds represented in the Snowy 2.0 workforce.
""People are coming from around the world and that's why we have a lot of players registered here,"" he said.

According to Nathan Thompson, prior to the Cooma Titans fielding junior and senior sides this season it had been decades since a new team joined the ranks.
""When you chat to past players you hear of these great times in the 1960s and 1970s where all towns, villages, and localities had teams. Unfortunately that's not the case at the moment,"" he said.
Seven new cricket clubs, including the Cooma Titans, formed in NSW this season according to Cricket NSW.
The 2023/'24 Cricket Australia census acknowledged the ""challenges all sports now face in ensuring participants continue to play sport for longer"", and said it had ""made retention initiatives a major priority"".
Nathan Thompson says there has been a rise in interest in the sport in the Snowy Mountains. (ABC South East NSW: Floss Adams)
""To get an extra team in the competition is quite unusual in country areas,"" Mr Thompson said.
Mr Thompson said the senior side was ""excellent"" and had become ""hard to beat"".
""They play a very attacking style,"" Mr Thompson said.
""Some of their batters are very big hitters and they can hit the ball a long way.""
""Their families come down and watch. They've probably got one of the larger, if not the largest supporter base in the competition.""

The local competition has helped the tight-knit team find a sense of community in the town that is often frequented by workers who only stay a few years for the Snowy scheme.
""We are all friends and our families know each other,"" Mr Abbasi said.
""There's not much to do [in Cooma] but if you're playing a sport that connects you to living here … that makes you more comfortable.""
Mirza Zeeshan, who was on a path to play professionally when he was younger in Pakistan, echoed those sentiments.
The Cooma Titans say they are open to more people joining the team in coming seasons. (ABC South East NSW: Floss Adams)
""Every town you visit [for matches] and you start to talk with people you start to learn. It's amazing,' he said.
And while they are in their early days, Mr Zeeshan had high hopes for the future of the Cooma Titans team and country cricket.
""And I hope we come out on top this season.""",ABC News,sports
Goalkeeper Lydia Williams and AFL captain Bob Murphy reveal how they overcame injury to reach new heights,"Thu, 20 Mar6080→",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-21/lydia-williams-matildas-bob-murphy-western-bulldogs-injuries/104981236,"We often think of professional athletes as unbreakable — after all, they're continually pushing the boundaries of what a body can do.
But in an industry obsessed with strength and speed, an injury can jeopardise an athlete's entire career, not to mention their mental health.
Soccer star Lydia Williams and AFL veteran Bob Murphy joined ABC Radio National's The Minefield to discuss how injuries forced them to embrace vulnerability and put their faith in their teammates.
Goalkeeper Lydia Williams spent the first years of her career feeling invincible.
Scouted by a coach in Canberra at 15, she made her debut in national women's soccer at 17 and established herself as a star goalkeeper for Canberra United and the Matildas.

Then in 2012, 24-year-old Williams was thrilled to spend a season in Sweden playing for a local club. But she played just three games before she tore her anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and was sent home for reconstructive surgery.
It was a harsh blow, delivered just as she felt she was rising in the sporting world.
""I was at the top of my game in Australia and I wanted to go overseas to prove myself and improve even more. And here I [was] facing a really major injury,"" Williams says.
The recovery was long and gruelling, with months spent under careful supervision from physiotherapists. She feared her physicality would change, as the surgery required removing tendons from her hamstrings to support her injured knee.
""[I thought], 'How is this possible that I have to relearn everything? Is my technique going to change when they reconstruct that ligament?'"" she says.
The history of Australia’s relationship to soccer tracks our transition from a monocultural society to a multicultural society.
When she returned to the game, she found the movements she had practised in rehab were different on the pitch. She no longer trusted her body, and her injury haunted her.
""I was playing on that field every day, so all of a sudden it was like revisited trauma,"" she recalls.
""[To] actually trust in that movement, where you're not thinking about it, that was the biggest barrier.""
Slowly, she rebuilt her strength and confidence. But just two years after her knee reconstruction, she was injured again.
This time, Williams was playing for the Western New York Flash in the National Women's Soccer League in the US when she tore her ACL and the meniscus in the same knee.
She remembers calling her team, her coach and her doctor from the sidelines, crying. But an experienced teammate — ""one of the most prolific players in the world"" — approached her with some advice.
""[She said], 'Lydia, you cry tonight, go get a drink, do whatever you need to do. Tomorrow, when you wake up, you're working. You're going back and you're going to make the World Cup',"" Williams recalls.
That goal led her through the recovery from her second knee reconstruction with a renewed sense of purpose and drive.
""Those heartbreaking emotions of feeling down and disappointed and angry were turned into action, words, a plan, progress,"" she says.

She had to completely trust the medical staff around her.
""My whole life has been about control and what I need to do to perform. But I've also learned throughout this that sometimes, you just have to put trust in other people,"" she says.
""It's a real struggle, giving your body [over] to someone else.""
She didn't just attend the World Cup in Canada in 2015. She also made a career-defining save that helped the Matildas win their first-ever World Cup knockout match.
""It was an amazing feat from everybody. It wasn't just one person, everyone had a common goal, everyone worked extremely hard,"" she says.
""And for me, it was a bit of a [middle] finger to all the injured knees that I've had, just to be like, 'I can do it … I'm better than before I got injured'.""

For Bob Murphy, an injury led to one of the most profound and moving moments of his professional life.
It was 2016 and the Western Bulldogs skipper had been playing for 17 years. As the oldest player — and the captain since 2015 — he felt a sense of responsibility for the ailing club.
By 2016, Murphy had spent half his life at the club and feared for its future. (AAP: Tracey Nearmy)
""We were going about as badly as a football club can go,"" he says.
""There was a deep sense of shame I felt as the elder of the footy team at the time.""
Their last captain, star player Ryan Griffen, had walked away; they'd had two disastrous seasons; and the club was facing financial strife. As Murphy puts it, ""the bruises were fresh"".
Then the season began. But after just three rounds, a ruptured ACL ended Murphy's run prematurely.
""I was almost certain that that was it, that was me finished,"" he recalls.
""I was 34 at the time, so on borrowed time anyway.""

With several more players sustaining injuries, another losing season seemed likely.
But the Bulldogs sailed through game after game until finally, they won the 2016 Grand Final and ended the club's 62-year premiership drought.
Murphy watched from the stands, ecstatic.
""There was a feeling and a warmth and a noise in a stadium that I've never felt before or since. It was quite extraordinary,"" he says.
Then, coach Luke Beveridge called Murphy to the podium and, as the crowd roared, took the medal he'd just been awarded and placed it around Murphy's neck.
""This is yours, mate. You deserve this more than anyone,"" he said.
Murphy describes the complicated wave of emotions that overcame him.
""[I felt] the pride and euphoria and joy of being a part of the club, knowing [its] story intimately, feeling it in my marrow,"" he says.
""But also the pain and heartbreak of not being in the footy boots — the euphoria had warts, that's how I would describe it.
""Both of those things smashed into each other, and it was almost too much to handle. I did feel weak in the legs.""
The emotional scene of the AFL premiership would stay with Murphy for years to come. (AAP: Julian Smith )
It was also ""a very personal thing played out in front of the masses"", he says.
""Luke was just telling me it was OK … That was between him and me.""
That feeling of connection outweighed his sense of victory.
""I think a lot of people miss the point. They ask about the medal, [like] 'do you feel like you're a premiership player?'"" he says.
Despite that, as the premiership buzz wore off, Murphy began to doubt himself. He returned to play the 2017 season as Bulldogs captain, but when pre-season training began, he found himself ""wracked with an inferiority complex"".
""[I thought], 'I am not a premiership player, how do I lead these guys?,"" he says.
In this special series, join Scott Stephens and Waleed Aly on ABC Radio National's The Minefield as they explore profound moral dilemmas with some of Australia's top athletes.
He also felt intense jealousy of his teammates who had played in that historic game.
""There is a notion, I think, for athletes and footballers and myself that, if that happened, everything would be complete. Life would reach this place of Nirvana, where there are no stubbed toes and you never run out of petrol,"" he says.
""I cornered [a teammate] sometime after the premiership and said, 'Just tell me, be straight with me, what's the feeling like?'
""And he said, 'Look, it was an incredible day. There were some wonderful times in the weeks after it, and then life moved on'.""
Murphy played his last game, against the Hawthorn Hawks, at the end of the 2017 season. At the end of the game, Murphy and two other retiring players were carried from the stadium through a guard of honour.
Since then, he has worked in media and in leadership roles with the Bulldogs and other clubs.
Now, ""with time and age"", Murphy looks back at his career — and the Grand Final he couldn't play — with fondness.

""I just see myself as one of the leaders, one of the elders at that time. Not a premiership player, but I was there, and I helped. That's enough.""
And when in doubt, he returns to the field where that Grand Final took place.
""Just to experience the smell of the grass on the MCG on an autumn evening — it doesn't get much better than that. And I was lucky to do it for so long.""",ABC News,sports
Brandon Smith joining South Sydney Rabbitohs from Sydney Roosters,"Thu, 20 Mar3024→",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-19/brandon-smith-joining-rabbitohs-from-sydney-roosters/105073070,"Brandon Smith will finally take up the chance to play under Wayne Bennett, with the former Kiwi hooker signing a two-year deal to join South Sydney.
Three years after backflipping on Bennett at the Dolphins, Smith has put pen to paper to work under the master coach at the Rabbitohs.
The hooker's move will at this stage happen next year, but the door remains open for an earlier switch from the Sydney Roosters if the two clubs can reach a deal.
A free-agent since last November, Smith was told during the summer he would not remain at the Roosters beyond the end of this year.
ABC Sport is live blogging every round of the AFL and NRL seasons in 2025.
While it had initially looked possible he could head to North Queensland in a swap with Reece Robson, Souths had recently become the more likely option.
Smith had joked last week that he may struggle to convince Bennett to sign him, after he met with the Dolphins in 2021 before eventually moving to the Tricolours.
But Bennett had been quick to put any history to the side, with the Rabbitohs in the market for a marquee hooker after releasing Damien Cook last year.
""I wanted him at the Dolphins and nothing's changed,"" Bennett said last week.
""He's just 100 per cent. Like Cam Murray and those players, they just give their absolute best every time they get on the footy field.
""They don't always get it right, but you know that the one thing they're doing is just competing for everything and they're giving their best for the side.""
Smith is sidelined until at least June after he ruptured his ACL late last year, and any early move would be unlikely before he returns to the field.
Souths chief executive Blake Solly admitted earlier this week the club had limited salary-cap space for 2025, potentially making an early move difficult.
While there may be some willingness for the move to occur early, Roosters captain James Tedesco also cautioned against it earlier this week.
""Hopefully we can have him for the rest of the year, because if he can come back he can really add some value to us,"" Tedesco said on Channel Nine.
""If Connor [Watson] can go [from fill-in hooker] to the lock role, that just adds value to our team.
ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.
""He can turn a game … hopefully he doesn't go to the Bunnies this year.
""He can create ruck speed, he can create that from running or short passes.""
Smith has endured a difficult run at the Roosters, adjusting to a play style that has previously preferred service-first dummy-halves that don't run the ball.
He has also endured several injuries during his time at the club, as well as being sat out for a game last year when he did not arrive to training on time.
His move will raise questions over the future of South Sydney's current No.9 Peter Mamouzelos, who is contracted until the end of 2027.

Australia defeat New Zealand by eight wickets to claim 1-0 lead in T20 series,Star Cats recruit ruled out of Saints clash as Power thump Tigers,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-21/australia-defeat-new-zealand-by-eight-wickets-in-first-t20/105080412,"Beth Mooney has celebrated her 200th international by powering Australia to an eight-wicket thumping of New Zealand in the first T20 in Auckland.
The left-handed opener smashed an unbeaten 75 as Australia made it to the target of 138 with 39 balls to spare.
Mooney and fellow opener Georgia Voll (50) blasted Australia to 0-77 from just six overs to stun the reigning T20 world champions at Eden Park on Friday.
ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.
The win has given Australia a 1-0 lead in the three-match series. The second game will be played on Sunday.
New Zealand were rattled by the ferocity of the batting, making a series of uncharacteristic mistakes in the field that made the result a formality.
It was Australia's highest opening partnership in a T20 against New Zealand.
Voll fell just 15 runs away from the target as Phoebe Litchfield also was dismissed, before Ellyse Perry helped Mooney steer Australia home.
The Aussies finished the job without star all-rounder Ashleigh Gardner, who was sent for scans on an injured finger.
Mooney's performance in her milestone match was fitting because she has been a constant, but often underrated, member of the all-conquering Australian side for almost a decade.
After electing to bat first, the White Ferns posted 2-137 on the back of an unbeaten 90-run partnership between Amelia Kerr (51 not out) and Sophie Devine (39 not out).
In her first international back after taking a mental break in December, star veteran Devine impressed at the crease with Kerr.
Stand-in captain Tahlia McGrath and quick Darcie Brown took Australia's only wickets.
Apart from being without injured captain Alyssa Healy, Australia picked a full-strength XI for the first of three games.
The White Ferns are the reigning T20 world champions after pulling off a surprise win at last October's tournament.
Australia, who had won the previous three T20 World Cups, were eliminated in the semifinals and were desperate to reassert their dominance.
Star bowler King, player of the series in the recent Ashes thumping of England, was left out in preference of fellow leg spinner Georgia Wareham.

A-League player Josh Cavallo reveals death threats he receives since coming out as gay,JBy Josephine Lim,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-19/soccer-josh-cavallo-death-threats/105069390,"Adelaide United defender Josh Cavallo, Australia's first openly gay male professional footballer, says he still receives daily death threats since coming out more than three years ago.
Speaking to FIFPRO's Footballers Unfiltered podcast with former English footballer Joe Hart, Cavallo shared how coming out when he was 21 years old brought a swell of toxicity and negativity into his life.
The player publicly announced he was gay in October 2021, becoming the first footballer to open up about his sexuality while playing in the A-League Men's competition.
Almost four years on, the 25-year-old said while coming out publicly was ""the best move and decision"" he had made, there had been ""mountains of downside"" that many did not realise.
""Why hasn't this happened in football? Why has no-one ever come out to be themselves and be successful and play?"" he told the podcast.
""And I understand that now looking back — all the negativity, all the things that come your way, there's multiple, multiple, multiple death threats that come my way daily still and it's quite sad to see.""
Josh Cavallo says he is proud of his representation in the LGBTQ+ community. (Supplied: Adelaide United)
Cavallo said he did not expect the level of toxicity on social media when he first came out publicly.
""It's a constant thing for me, unfortunately — I step onto the field or I get injured or something happens in my football, it's all got to do [with] my sexuality.
""I still think we're a very, very long way from being accepted in this space, unfortunately.""
He told ABC that despite being on the receiving end of abuse, he still had positive experiences meeting people who were inspired and encouraged by his advocacy.
""In my everyday life, I'd be at the local shops, I'd be at the local cafe and a little child would come up to me and know who I am and speak to me and say how I guided them and how I give them the courage to come out at school,"" he said.
""On the other side … opening my social media this morning, it was quite disturbing reading the comments that got sent my way.""
Proud 2 Play, a grassroots non-for-profit organisation that aims to create safe and welcoming sporting spaces for queer and gender diverse people, said experiences like Cavallo's were all too familiar.
Community development officer Kade Matthews said the level of abuse was ""not surprising to me at all"", but said it reflected ""systematic problems"" that were not confined to elite level.
""The problem that we're trying to address isn't actually at this top level with random people on the internet, it's the whole culture that we've got around sport,"" he said.
""The mentality of banter and 'friendly jokes' … is really harmful and we've just got to reframe how we look at our teammates with respect.""
But Mr Matthews said that changing the culture was not about ""fundamentally"" changing sport itself.
""The homophobic language by fans of AFL and rugby and other sports, by players, by coaches, isn't taught at the national league level — it's happening in under-10s, under-12s, under-15s.
""That's where we've really got to change space and make those welcoming environments feed all the way up.
""Just having it at the top-level club isn't enough, just having it in under-10s isn't enough. We need to do the whole lot.""
SA Premier Peter Malinauskas said it was ""awful to hear"" of the daily vitriol aimed at Cavallo.
""To hear news of these death threats is really awful, I mean beyond awful — it's unacceptable,"" he said.
""It speaks to a degree of cowardice that we know that exists in the community but here in South Australia I'm very proud of the fact that it of course represents the smallest of minorities of people.""
Mr Malinauskas said Cavallo deserved ""a lot of credit for his courage"".
""Speaking out the way he has, I think he deserves recognition for that,"" he said.
The footballer said before coming out, he felt isolated, would think up cover stories and would not hang out with his teammates in fear of being ""caught out in my lies"".
""There was a 24/7 act on top of trying to be the best athlete you can possibly be every day for football,"" he said.
Cavallo said telling his coach and assistant coach, and later his teammates, felt ""like 15 kilos of weight has been lifted off my shoulders"".
He said when Adelaide United released an emotional video of his announcement in 2021, the post ""changed perspectives around the world and definitely took the world of football for a shock"".
""It's obviously moved mountains of people and influenced a lot of people and made so much progression within the game and I wouldn't trade it for anything,"" he said.
Adelaide United said on Wednesday it was aware of the ""ongoing abuse"" Cavallo had been receiving on social media, and that the club stood ""firmly in support of him"".
""We will continue to support Josh both on and off the pitch, ensuring he has everything he needs to feel safe and valued as a member of our Reds family,"" the club said in a statement.
""That's why we are committed to ongoing education and visibility initiatives, such as Pride celebrations in the A-Leagues, to drive meaningful change and promote inclusivity in football.
""Josh continues to illustrate his courage, and we have no doubt by continuing to tell his story he is positively impacting the lives of many across the community, which we as a club are incredibly proud of.""
In 2022, A-League club Melbourne Victory was handed a $5,000 fine over homophobic abuse from fans directed at Cavallo.
At the time, Football Australia said the Victory had promptly denounced its fans' behaviour and the $5,000 would be used to ""further invest in LGBTQ+ awareness and education initiatives in football"".
Cavallo said he was proud to be his ""authentic self"" while playing top-tier football.
""I think football has a space for people like me and I'm really proud to be wearing the flag and really proud to be the representation of LGBTQ+ community,"" he said.",ABC News,sports
Melbourne Storm beat Penrith Panthers after Nathan Cleary concussed in NRL grand final rematch,"Thu, 20 Mar3024→",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-20/nrl-live-blog-melbourne-storm-vs-penrith-panthers/105071988,"The Melbourne Storm have won a war of attrition against the Penrith Panthers, who had to battle through most of their NRL grand final rematch without superstar halfback Nathan Cleary.
The Storm left AAMI Park with the competition points after a 30-24 victory, but the gutsy Panthers deserved plenty of applause for pushing the home side to the final whistle.
Already missing injured Test fullback Dylan Edwards, Penrith lost Cleary after just seven minutes when he came off second best against opposite number Jahrome Hughes when the pair collided off the ball.
There was a scramble of bodies after Melbourne fullback Ryan Papenhuyzen put a kick through and Cleary jumped backwards into Hughes before landing heavily, with a concussion ending his night.

With Cleary in the sheds, Storm coach Craig Bellamy admitted some of his players may have relaxed a little too much after the lead kicked out to 14-0 on the back of tries to Grant Anderson and Eli Katoa and a penalty goal in the first 20 minutes.
""Not sure if we got a little bit complacent or we got a little bit lazy,"" he said in the post-match media conference.
""I think some of the players probably thought, in the back of your mind that voice is telling you 'it's going to be OK today'. You just can't do that with them, doesn't matter who they've got in their side.""
The Panthers have now lost consecutive matches in their premiership defence. (Getty Images: Daniel Pockett)
Despite the result, Panthers coach Ivan Cleary said he was ""proud"" of his side's performance.
""There's lots of things that we sort of didn't help ourselves throughout the game,"" he said.
""There's clearly a lack of cohesion at times, which is understandable.
""But I thought from a cultural point of view, I thought they were very brave.
""I thought the boys couldn't have tried any harder.""
Melbourne also had casualties in centre Nick Meaney, suffering a suspected broken jaw after a head clash with teammate Nelson Asofa-Solomona, while winger Anderson limped off with a knee injury and Cameron Munster was put on report for a hip drop on Liam Martin.

What a strange and hectic evening of rugby league.
I can't say I know much more about the Storm's quality after that than I did before the game, but I do know the Panthers will never stop coming at you, no matter who is on the park.
Let's cross our fingers for quick recoveries for Nathan Cleary, Nick Meaney and Grant Anderson.
I'll be back on the blog tomorrow for Warriors vs Roosters and Broncos vs Cowboys.
Until then, have a lovely night.
By Jon Healy
The Storm coach is alongside Harry Grant in the media conference.
He says he's ""not overly"" happy.
""Not sure if we got a little bit complacent or we got a little bit lazy,"" he says, disappointed after an impressive first 20 minutes.
""I think some of the players probably thought, in the back of your mind that voice is telling you 'it's going to be OK today'. You just can't do that with them, doesn't matter who they've got in their side.""
Bellamy cops some of the blame for taking the two points to go up 14-0, as if that could have instilled some complacency, but gee I think that's rough. This bloke has really mellowed in the past few years.
Captain Grant basically acknowledges the team probably relaxed a little, but credits the determination of the young Panthers line-up.
""There's plenty to work on, which is good. Gives us plenty to work on going forward,"" Grant says.
By Jon Healy
Ivan Cleary and Isaah Yeo are in the hot seat.
""They were very brave, just never stopped,"" Cleary says of his team.
""The boys couldn't have tried any harder.""
After trotting out youngsters Casey McLean, Blaize Talagi and Jack Cole, plus inexperienced players like Tom Jenkins at the back, Cleary says 2025 shapes as a unique challenge for the depth of the team.
""We've obviously lost a few key players but we've done that before. Our depth has gotten younger, that's for sure.""
Yeo says  the team and particularly those younger players ""will take a lot from"" tonight's game.
Cleary says the difference came down to the Storm's key players executing big moments.
By Jon Healy
It seems like a lifetime ago that Grant Anderson and Eli Katoa powered the Storm to an early 14-0 lead.
In amongst that, Nathan Cleary was concussed in a strange off-ball collision with opposite number Jahrome Hughes in the eight minute, bringing boom youngster Blaize Talagi onto the field for his first NRL minutes as a Panther.
Jack Cole and Tom Jenkins stood tall in place of Nathan Cleary and Dylan Edwards but both, as well as Talagi, had a few crucial rookie errors. Cole and Jenkins knocked on at inopportune times, and Talagi looked generally shaky, including dying with the ball in his hands on the last play.
Nelson Asofa-Solomona charged onto the field for the first time in 2025 after a suspension that cost him a spot in last year's grand final and immediately made a mess of things. He flew out of the line trying to put a shot on Liam Henry but could only manufacture a brutal head clash with teammate Nick Meaney, leaving Meaney with a broken jaw. NAS also made a couple of costly errors.
Cameron Munster went on report for a hip-drop tackle on Liam Martin and later, after creating what should have been the game-sealing try, gave away a penalty by getting too aggro in Martin's face and potentially costing his team victory in the final minutes.
Grant Anderson also copped a nasty knee injury and while he returned to the game, he certainly didn't look too healthy on that right knee.
By Jon Healy
Cameron Munster says it was an ""erratic"" outing from the Storm and said he would want a few moments back.
He's clearly referring to his last-minute penalty for getting up in the grill of Liam Martin and potentially costing the Storm the game.
""It was an up-and-down performance from myself. Liam got the best of me there,"" he tells Channel Nine.
""I've just gotta be a bit more smarter.""
Shortly after saying that, during a conversation about his physique, he jokes he's ""on the peptides"".
Munny, brother.
By Jon Healy
I don't know where to start with that match, because it was utterly bizarre.
After Melbourne's two tries to start the game, and Nathan Cleary's concussion in the eighth minute, I thought this was going to be a real blowout. But things got wild after that.
The Storm took their eye off the ball and the Panthers simply refused to go away with impressive performances from usual suspects like Isaah Yeo and Liam Martin, but huge performances filling in from Jack Cole and Tom Jenkins.
The Storm spine was once again immense (save for one last-minute brainfade from Cameron Munster) and came up with clutch plays to hold off the Penrith fightback.
I'd expect, despite the loss, Ivan Cleary will be much happier than opposing coach Craig Bellamy after that game.
By Jon Healy
This will be the last set.
Talagi is monstered and the Storm survive!
By Jon Healy
Harry Grant applies the pressure from the inside and forces a handling error from Jack Cole on the left-side shift.
How cruel that this game could be decided by errors from Jenkins and Cole.
By Jon Healy
The Storm aim up in defence and force the error from Liam Martin, then Cameron Munster flies up and shoves him in the back, forcing Adam Gee to flip it and penalise the Storm. Absolutely bone-headed stuff from Munster.
By Jon Healy
Paul Alamoti hooks his kick and Melbourne leads by a converted try.
Meanwhile, Grant Anderson hobbles back onto the right wing.
By Jon Healy
The slick surface and slicker hands is making Penrith unstoppable.
The Panthers go right, then left, then right, then left and eventually Brian To'o crashes through Ryan Papenhuyzen for another clutch try.
By Jon Healy
There's five minutes left, so Penrith needs to score here to keep it alive. Would you bet against them the way tonight has transpired?
By Jon Healy
Tui Kamikamica attracts four defenders out on the left and every member of the Storm's superstar spine feature as the ball comes back to the right.
Cameron Munster pokes in the kick off his wrong foot and Ryan Papenhuyzen dives in.
That's straight off the error by Tom Jenkins. Brutal for the young fullback who's done so much right tonight.
By Jon Healy
The development squad member has had a near-perfect night at fullback, but he's dropped it on the third tackle 20 metres from his tryline with this game in the balance.
It looked like Mitch Kenny was in two minds who to pass to and Scott Sorensen pulled back at the last second.
By Jon Healy
The Panthers were on the wrong side of a miraculous against-the-odds win last week. Could they flip the script tonight?
By Jon Healy
Absolutely phenomenal hands from the Panthers as they go the width of the field. Isaah Yeo and Lindsay Smith slick as you like, and Cole, Talagi and McLean sum it up out wide to send To'o in on the left.
By Jon Healy
Ryan Papenhuyzen cleans up a grubber on the tryline but it comes loose as he slides along the turf. The Storm weather the attack on the right thanks to a stunning Jack Howarth tackle on a flying Liam Martin, but it's a penalty. I'm honestly not sure what for.
By Jon Healy
Liam Martin gives away a penalty and the Storm spine comes together for a conference. They build into shape and spin it left, but Ryan Papenhuyzen knocks on cold in the face of some solid defence.
I have to say, the right side of Penrith (Martin, Cole, Tago and Alamoti) has done a great job on both sides of the ball in trying circumstances tonight.
By Jon Healy
The panthers spin it early and Paul Alamoti dismisses Cameron Munster and Harry Grant before being dragged down at the last by Ryan Papenhuyzen.

How Geelong champ Steve Johnson revolutionised kicking at goal in the AFL,"Thu, 20 Mar6080→",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-14/the-sporting-innovators-steve-johnson-and-the-afl-j-curve/104978952,"There are some innovations that come out of nowhere — an idea that seemingly pops out of the ether and emerges as an entirely new creation.
Then there are those innovations which require someone who sees something that already exists and adapts it so that it takes on an entirely new life.
Steve Johnson's round the corner snap — or the J-Curve as it came to be known — is one of the latter.
The kick is used for shots at goal from acute angles. A player kicking around their body with their right foot can effectively open up the goal angle by imparting forward and side spin on the ball, making it curve in the air from right to left.
For all the innovations and evolution of Australian Rules Football, the most basic skill of the game, kicking, has changed little over the past half-century.
By the 1970s, the standard kicks of previous eras — the drop kick and flat punt — were on their way out and the place kick shot for goal was long gone.
It's impossible to say who invented the drop punt, though certainly by the 1930s it was being used by legends of the game such as Richmond's Jack Dyer.
But as early as the 1910s, Collingwood players were using a stab punt which is essentially the same kick — albeit with a shorter follow through — for short and fast passing.
For 50 years, the drop punt has been the ubiquitous kick of Australian Rules football for obvious reasons: the back-spin imparted on the ball makes it long and accurate, while the method of kicking has less margin for error than a drop kick.
The torpedo punt is still pulled out occasionally when a player is going for extra distance, but unlike the reliable drop punt, it's a difficult kick to execute repeatedly.
The banana kick shot for goal is seen less often as players become more proficient with kicking snap shots on their non-dominant foot.
The snap shot around the corner kick has been the biggest change to the kicking landscape in Australian Rules since the drop punt became the dominant kicking method of the game.
And it's all thanks to one man.

Johnson was one of the great showmen of the AFL in the first two decades of the century.
He was often described as mercurial, but that term denies his consistent brilliance.
Over 253 games for Geelong — including three premierships and the 2007 Norm Smith Medal — and 40 games for GWS, Johnson established himself as a legend of the game in the midfield and the forward line.
In 2011 he became the last player in the AFL to average more than 20 disposals and two goals in a season — something he also did in 2008 — which attested to his ability to win a game off his boot.
Over his career, Johnson kicked five or more goals 17 times and so many of his 516 goals were slotted with his unique J-Curve.
The round the corner snap kick has always been a part of Australian Rules.
Kicking across the body is the obvious go-to if a player is moving parallel or away from the goals or a teammate, and because of pressure is unable to straighten up.
But prior to Johnson's innovation, it was only ever really used in general play, or if a player taking a shot for goal played on to open up the angle.
Blair Campbell was doing it for Richmond as early as 1968.
Richmond's Blair Campbell uses a snap shot in 1968.
Johnson's genius was to recognise that the snap was a more accurate method for set-shot kicks for goal from acute angles.
What is extraordinary is that insight came when he was just 10-years-old, inspired by his idol, the Collingwood legend Peter Daicos.
""He was the king of the trick kicks when he was playing in the 80s and 90s,"" Johnson told ABC sport.
""I would spend a lot of my time practising the dribble kicks, practising kicking drop punts into my basketball ring out the back of my house and kicking snap kicks at the basketball ring as well.""
And when Johnson went to the footy in his home town of Wangaratta, he'd always kick the snap.
""It kind of originated from me being a young kid practising kicking at goal from the boundary line on the local footy ground,"" he said.
""When you go to have shots at quarter time or half time at the local footy, very rarely do you see kids going to have shots from 20m out, directly in front.
Johnson tussles with future West Coast forward Quinten Lynch during the under-18 National Championships in 2001. Johnson said he had developed his innovative kick at a young age. (Getty Images: ALLSPORT/Darren McNamara)
""I was no different — I'd go straight to the boundary. But when I was taking my shots from the boundary, I'd never set up as if I was gonna kick a drop punt.
""I would just set up to kick a snap, side-on with the goals.""
For those advocates of Malcolm Gladwell's 10,000 hours rule, Johnson could be a prime candidate for the argument.
""I got very good at it because I had a football in my hands, you know, every spare minute of the day, basically,"" he said.
""That's what I did: I went to footy training; I went to the local footy on the weekends and at school I did the same — I was kicking goals at lunchtime.
""So, I got very good at kicking snap shots, and I had a really good technique.
Johnson said he wasn't thinking a great deal about what he was doing, rather, he said it was just instinctively right thing to do.
That was until it dawned on him that his set snap shot for goal from a standing start was actually more reliable than kicking a drop punt from the boundary.
Johnson said the beauty of the kick was its predictability, and as he became better with his thousands of hours of practice, its accuracy.
""I'd probably thought about it a little bit more and thought about 'what is the percentage play?'"" he said.
""I knew that basically anywhere inside the boundary line, if I was taking a snap and I'd set up right, I'd kick it nine times out of 10.
""Whereas if I went with a drop punt, it's probably a five out of 10.""
Jimmy Bartel kicks a goal in the 2011 grand final with Steve Johnson's innovative kick.
He said the reason the snap was more predictable is because it was a more forgiving kick than the drop punt.
""You can drop the ball a little bit lower and basically hit the spot on the ball that you want almost perfectly every time,"" he said.
""And you're actually hitting a more forgivable spot on the ball as well because you're kicking more of the belly of the ball, even though it's underneath it.
""You can also put bend on the football, so get it spinning and put some bend on the footy.""
He honed his technique over the years so that it was consistent on both his right and left foot.
The key was to hold the ball underneath with his guiding hand (the hand on the same side as his kicking foot) which gave him more control as he dropped the ball, allowing him to place it closer to his foot.

The football would be held at an angle pointing back towards his left hip, while he would align his body at a 90 degree angle to the goals, take two steps out and kick.
""I've just got to drop the ball, like in the same spot and kick up on it, and the ball will swing back into the goals,"" he said.
And it turns out he had a physiological quirk that worked to his advantage.
""I was born with one leg slightly longer than the other, I needed a lot of adjusting and chiropractic work as a young kid because my femur, the way my legs come into my hips, they come in on a on an angle,"" Johnson said.
""And so, if I take my leg back, my leg goes back on a slight angle as well, it doesn't go straight back.
""So, the way my rotation works to kick the football, it's better for me to kick across the body. My body actually suits the snap kick probably more so than just about anyone.""
The kick had been perfected. All that remained was an opportunity to try it out in an AFL game.
Despite his proficiency with the snap kick, Johnson didn't use it in an AFL for the first few years of his career out of fear that he could be criticised if he tried it and missed.
But eventually his confidence in his ability to execute the kick overcame the doubts during a game against Carlton at Docklands several years into his career.
It is likely it was the round eight game in 2005 — Johnson's fourth year in the AFL — when he found himself with a set shot opportunity in the left forward pocket.

""I think it was just the perfect spot for me to kick it from. It was 30m out; it was on a reasonably tight angle without being on the boundary,"" he said.
""It was certainly a spot where most players would have kicked the drop punt and been happy being close to kicking it.""
Should he kick a drop punt knowing it was a 50-50 chance, but safe in the knowledge he wouldn't be criticised if he missed?
""Or do I go for this knowing it's a nine out of 10? But if I miss…. yeah, the world might come down on me,"" he said.
He decided to go for it.
""So, I've gone back to the mark and then I've come back forward, looked at the guy on the mark and turned side on with the goal and the man on the mark,"" Johnson said.
Johnson went through his routine, kicked the goal and followed it up minutes later with another set snap shot on his left foot from the opposite pocket.
It was arguably the first time anyone had ever set up to take a shot for goal without directly facing the posts in the 150 year history of the VFL/AFL.
The set snap shot is so common now that we forget how foreign it looked when Johnson took his first kicks at goal while deliberately setting up at right angles to his target.
""I remember there was a there was a little bit said about it (after the game). But there would have been a lot more said about it had I missed,"" he said.
""I was taking a punt and doing something different. As I said (I) could be looking like, you know, 'this kid's got a bit of high confidence levels, a high opinion of himself and he's trying to do something to look like he's showing off'.
""But that certainly wasn't the case. This had been something, 10,15 years in the making and I was doing what I believed was the percentage play.""
Johnson's belief didn't stop criticism from the detractors — particularly as other players began to use the snap kick for set shots.
""When it started catching on and players started doing it, not everyone had done the repetitions, not everyone had honed-in on what their technique needs to look like,"" he said.
""I was watching what they (the commentators) were watching and almost going, 'you know what, he's kind of got a point because that player is not doing it right'.
""If they knew how to do it right, you'd be able to change the views of these professionals that you were stuck in in their era.""
Johnson said he can predict whether or not a player will successfully kick a snap shot by the way they set up and how they're holding the ball.
""A lot of players, if you see them set up with the ball horizontal, you know that they're probably gonna miss to the right of the goals, because that ball will float out a little bit before they make contact with it,"" he said.
Similarly, he said he sometimes sees players adjust their angle to the goal, which means they will likely miss to the narrow side.
""Whereas I know with how I hold the ball and being at 90 degrees, I've just got to drop the ball, like in the same spot and kick up on it, and the ball will swing back into the goals,"" he said.
""But if they step to the left, the 90 degrees for them is probably left point post and so they have to guess somewhere between the point of the ball which we're trying to hit the bottom of and the belly of the ball and that's really hard to execute.""
The kick — and technique — slowly took over as the preferred shot for goal from acute angles, starting with his Geelong teammates.
""It become something that I got really good at and then you know, clearly, we were having goal kicking comps after training and the other guys were starting to set up exactly the same way and practise it,"" he said.
""Over the years, (I) certainly taught a lot of lot of players what I try to do technique wise, to make sure you know you can execute it.
""Someone like Paul Chapman was an excellent snap kick. Tom Hawkins was the same, James Podsiadly, you know, obviously all teammates in the forward line with me.

""And then I went to GWS and tried to share a bit of knowledge with those guys and Toby Greene became a great snap, Jeremy Cameron became a great snap.
""Now, they might have become great snap kicks anyway, but I certainly helped refine their techniques.""
He said the best current exponent of the snap kick is Hawthorn's Luke Breust.
As to who coined the phrase ""the J-Curve"", Johnson thinks it was the legendary commentator, Dennis Cometti.
""One day in commentary he said: 'here he is: Stevie Johnson's gone with the J-curve',"" he said.
Two men, from opposite ends of the world, within the space of two years both dared to change cricket, by hitting the ball where most thought it could not be hit.
He said he had a sense of pride that something he started is now an accepted part of the game.
""I was the first one to do that, so when I see that, yeah, it kinda makes you feel I guess a little bit special,"" he said.
""Only because like I'm a footy tragic and I didn't set out to try to do something completely different that changed the game.
""I've just done something that because I had a footy in my hands probably more than any kid in history, I developed something which has now become normal.
""So, the pride would be in having a bit of a legacy in the game you love.""
It took 50 years for Johnson's intuitive spark to create a new form of kick in Australian Rules, which raises the question of whether there are any more innovations that could come into the game.
""Yes,"" Johnson said without hesitation,
""There's another kick. Yeah.""
He calls it the ""sliced banana"".
But that's another story.

"Kyneton women's side leave football club after claims of 'horrible, volatile environment'","Thu, 20 Mar6080→",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-02-18/kyneton-womens-team-widespread-mistreatment-across-state/104945784,"Kyneton Football and Netball Club's women's team made the decision to break away from the club in the wake of what players describe as a ""horrible, volatile environment"", while the club maintains it has always been as inclusive as possible.
Player and president of the newly formed Kyneton Women's Eagles Football Club Natalie Korinfsky said the group of 35 women's players decided to make a stand and go out on their own after claims of inequitable treatment and disrespect from the club had left them ""completely distressed"".
A group of female footballers has split from the Kyneton Football Netball Club due to concerns about gender equity.
This comes as players spoken to by ABC Sport from other clubs around the state claim poor treatment, inequitable access to resources and a lack of support from their football clubs.
It follows research by the Victorian government, which uncovered almost a third of women who play community sport in Victoria had considered leaving their club due to inequitable treatment.
""All we want to do is play football and be treated with respect, and if you don't have those fundamentals, it's impossible to stay in those environments,"" Korinfsky told ABC Sport.
""You just think, how can you stay at a club that is like this?""
Korinfsky said there was an underlying culture at the club which often made the women's team feel unwelcome or unsupported. For example, a 'pride' sticker which was put up in the club rooms by the women's team for their 'Pride Cup' game was ripped down.
""Now we don't know who ripped it down, but that is the sentiment that is kind of running through the club,"" Korinfsky said.

Korinfsky also said the women's team would often come into the club rooms after the men had played and find blood, spit and faeces in the bathroom, which they would have to clean up. ABC Sport have seen images of this.
However, the catalyst for them finally deciding to break away was when the women's team played in the grand final last year against Macedon, down the road in Woodend, while the club held their annual raffle draw at their home ground at the same time. This made it impossible for committee members or other people involved in the club to go along and support the women's team.
""That pretty much broke the heart of most of our players,"" Korinfsky said.
Co-captain Belinda Hateley said despite the success of the women's team, hardly anyone from KFNC turned up to support them in either the 2023 or 2024 grand finals.
""If it was a men's team, there's no way that they would have had a raffle on at the same time,"" Hateley said.
""That's incomprehensible. That would be insane if they did that. So we've sort of just always felt that we're not that important.""

KFNC said they were never informed of any misconduct against any member of the senior women's leadership group, individual players or guests of the club.
""It's disappointing to now be accused of these allegations in the media,"" a statement provided to ABC Sport said.
""The club has always addressed any player welfare concerns that were communicated to the committee. We strive to be as inclusive as possible and have always addressed things when they are raised.""
The statement went on to say the club was strong supporters of women's football and was committed to fielding a senior women's team and continuing the pathway and enjoyment of their youth girls football team.
""Unfortunately, recent actions by the members of the Kyneton Womens Sports Club ('KWSC') suggest there is some form of vendetta against the club. There has been a relentless smear campaign causing significant reputational damage to KFNC,"" the statement read, which added the 'unsafe' narrative directed at the club was ""deeply offensive and insulting"".
Kyneton's women's coach Phil Hawkes, who has been involved in the coaching and administration side of football for more than 20 years, said he was not surprised that practically all the women's players walked, but he thought it might have taken the club off guard.
""They [KFNC] thought only a few might leave,"" Hawkes said.
""So I think that part of it was a big shock that everybody left and said, 'No, we've had enough of this'.
""The resources not being shared as maybe they could have been, or should have been, the lack of support from the committee and the rest of the club in general.""
Korinfsky said five other women's teams had contacted them since they split from KFNC, with the teams facing similar behavioural issues at their clubs.

Jane,* a player from North East Victoria who wished to remain anonymous due to fear of backlash from her club's board, said their women's team were often on the receiving end of poor treatment from the club, which made it an ""uncomfortable space"" to be.
""We've had members go along to supposedly whole club preseason events and had some pretty dispiriting comments made about them,"" Jane said.
This included homophobic rhetoric, such as the master of ceremonies making comments about how the female footballers were only there to pick up netballers, she said.
In the Change Our Game State of Play Survey, almost a third (28 per cent) of women who played community sport said they had considered leaving their club due to inequitable treatment.
In the report released July 2023, of the 670 Victorians canvassed, more than half reported gendered discrimination in community sport and 55 per cent said they had experienced or seen sexist language and jokes.

It also found women were 2.5 times more likely to report feeling unwelcome at their sporting club compared to men and 90 per cent of women said gender inequality was still an issue in sport that needs to be fixed.
""I'm not going pull the not all men line, but of course, some of the younger players in the boys and men's programs are probably fine with the fact that there's female football,"" Jane said.
""I think most of the problems stem from the old boys, the ones that played in the 70s that have been hanging around the club ever since. So some of them are great club volunteers in the men's program, but just have views that haven't changed much [regarding women in sport].""
A common issue amongst women's players spoken to for this story was inequitable allocation of resources, including access to grounds and facilities, which government grants aim to fix.
As of July last year, funding from the Victorian government for community sport infrastructure has required local governments to have a gender equitable access and use policy or equivalent in place, and for progress regarding those policies to be shown over time.
Sarah Styles, director of the Office for Women in Sport and Recreation (OWSR), said the government implemented the Fair Access Policy Roadmap to support local councils and facility managers ""to fairly allocate sporting grounds, courts, change rooms and other facilities, and provide safe, supportive and enjoyable environments for women and girls' teams.""

Ros Spence, the Minister for Community Sport, added that the road map exists to hold councils to account ""so all women and girls have the opportunities and facilities they deserve"", as the government worked to level the playing field for women and girls in sport.
However, Jane said while these policies sound great, implementation in communities is tricky. During preseason at her club, the men's side booked the main training oval every night of the week, rendering it unavailable for the women's side to use, which ""completely flies in the face of fair access policies"".
Korinfsky said the Kyneton women's team didn't get ""fair access to the ground"" and had training sessions often put on ""crappy nights of the week"", and were forced to train on Mondays when they had games on Sunday ""because the boys always had priority"".
Similarly, Sarah**, a 32-year-old woman from Bendigo who wished to remain anonymous due to fear of ramifications from her club, said when her club's main oval had been shared between the men's and women's teams, they would have issues of the men's players running through the women's drills.
""We're in a small 50m arc of the oval and they've got the other three quarters and we're still being intruded on,"" Sarah said.
""It can be intimidating and it's really frustrating … We have a number of staunch women on our team who will feel comfortable in saying, 'Hey, you know, mind your manners, watch yourself' but it's kind of laughed upon. It's not really taken seriously.""

Since 2014, the government has invested around $750 million to support more than 1,460 female friendly community sport and recreation projects. According to the OWSR, as part of the acquittal process for a grant, the grant recipient needs to share specific detail and evidence of how funds were expended.
However, Jane said it had become apparent in the last year that her club was happy to spruik its female football credentials when it meant getting major grants, but they had no intention of honouring any increase in participation or access to resources for female football.
""There are some very savvy grant writers at the club who have discovered that you can leverage your female football program to benefit your men's program,"" Jane said.
It's not just grant money that players are concerned doesn't go directly into their programs either. Many felt money was brought in by the women's team through sponsors or fundraising efforts, but went back into the club as a whole to use at their discretion.
This left them with little to no decision-making power over how they were run.
At Jane's club, she said the only interaction between the women's team and the board, who ruled the finances, was when the female program would ""have to hold our hat begging"" to buy footballs or get access to resources.

A sticking point was that the women's team had sourced sponsors for their program which the club then called ""whole club sponsors"", with the money not used for the female program.
""So we're sort of at a bit of a stand-off in terms of, do we go out and seek more sponsorship or don't we, because we know that we're not going to get access to it, even if we do,"" Jane said.
""We don't feel like we're doing the right thing by businesses and organisations that want to sponsor female football as we can't guarantee to them that their money is going to be put into female football.""
The Kyneton Women's Team are now in search of a home, after being rejected by three local leagues.
The Ballarat Football Netball League and AFL Central Victoria both said the new club had missed a December deadline to join their leagues and the Riddell District Football Netball League denied their application for a standalone team.
ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.
The RDFNL said the KWFC application was rejected because of the failure to meet the RDFNL Statement of Rules criteria and the deadline for new clubs under the AFL Victoria rules and workshopped five different solutions for the women's only club.
""It's impossible to get out of them [football clubs] because we can't get into a league standing on our own,"" Korinfsky said.
""[But] we don't want to stay in a horrible, volatile environment where nobody will help us to manage the issues at hand.
""But then they won't let us leave either, or they suggest we just go to another club that has a similar set up, but doing this risks putting our team back in a similar environment and we just aren't prepared to do that again.
""I think they don't want us to set a precedent of women's teams forming their own clubs.""

Korinfsky added the need to separate also came down to women's football teams being very different beasts to male ones.
""I think that they have to be looked at with a different approach,"" said Korinfsky, adding that all they wanted was a safe place to play football.
""It's really around the systemic issues that prevent women accessing sport in a safe and equitable environment. We've got so much legislation, so many policies, we've got everybody talking the talk around this stuff, we've got AFL Victoria putting in action plans for women and girls to play sport, yet nobody's addressing these fundamental issues on the ground that are preventing women from being able to play sport in a safe environment.
""We believe we have the right to play sport in a safe, supportive and equitable environment, and that's what we're doing as a club, and we're just asking for a fair go.""

"Lions watch: Six Nations belongs to France, as England pummel Wales, Scotland falls away and Ireland don't turn up",SBy Simon Smale,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-16/six-nations-review-british-and-irish-lions-watch/105057556,"France is the Six Nations champion, and deservedly so, but Scotland once again showed that it has all the ingredients to challenge the best teams in the world with another battling display in Paris.
Scotland had its chances in the first half — and had Frenchman Peato Mauvaka been sent off for a flying headbutt in that first half, who knows what would have happened.
But the Scots were just missing that final spark to send them over the line, a lack of polish that cost them dear all tournament.
England did all they could to pile the pressure on France earlier in the day, handing Wales a desperate, record hammering in Cardiff.
Wales' performance had to be one of the most abject in an increasingly lengthy list of meek displays, surely terminating any fringe Lions players hopes of a call up for this summer's tour.
Ireland though barely managed to sneak past an always improving Italy, with plenty of their big names going missing in Rome.

How players respond in pressure-cooker environments will have been key to what Andy Farrell was looking for this week — and England answered that call best of all three visiting sides.
Cardiff has so often been a graveyard for English hopes and dreams, indeed 12 years ago, with both teams hunting the title, Wales hammered England 30-3 to steal the Six Nations crown and ensure that the vast majority of that year's Lions Test team would be Welsh.
Fast forward to today and England entered that febrile cauldron, simmering as usual in nationalistic fervour, and had those same baying fans drifting into the Cardiff evening to wallow in their nation's absolute humiliation after bullying the Welsh to their 17th-straight defeat.
Take your pick of England's stand outs. Maro Itoje? Tick. Will Stewart? Tick. Both Currys? Tick. Tick.
Fin Smith has turned into a genuine star. (Getty Images: The RFU Collection/Dan Mullan)
But let's talk about Fin Smith, a man who has grabbed hold of the England number 10 shirt and has done everything in his power to make sure he's wearing that same shirt for the Lions in the first Test in Brisbane.
Another assured performance featuring cross-field kicks, well-timed passes and general stewardship is making his case ever more convincing.
Finn Russell will no doubt be a consideration — he was superb as Scotland sniped and harried France throughout the first half — but Sam Prendergast is stagnating a little and showing his inexperience, while Jack Crowley did not do enough to grab his opportunity in Rome.
Then there's England's forgotten pair, surprise inclusion to England's team George Ford who was excellent, and Marcus Smith, who will not play 10 for England while Fin Smith is there despite his unmistakable talent.
Picking a back row for the first Lions Test may well be the hardest job in sport.
Everywhere you look there are players who are stepping up.
This week, as with most weeks, England's trio were irrepressible: Tom Curry, Ben Curry and Ben Earl were all brilliant, while Tom Willis and debutant Henry Pollock also were superb off the bench.

Scotland number eight Matt Fagerson and his Ireland counterpart Caelan Doris are also in sublime form and although Wales skipper Jac Morgan wasn't at his best against England — understandably tired from having to carry his nation for the previous four rounds no doubt — he is a solid performer and will do well for the Lions.
Rory Darge and Jamie Ritchie also both excelled in a brutal battle up front against France in Paris, although when l'equipe de bomb was introduced — France's version of the Springbok's bomb squad reserves entering the field en mass — they did fall off.
It's a position that carries a high attrition rate so perhaps we'll see most of the above at some stage during the Tests, but the biggest challenge for Andy Farrell will be the make up of that squad.
But given the avalanche of talent in this regard, plus the trend of picking a 7-1 bench, don't be surprised to see some of these players pop up in midfield late on in games in the situation arrises, just as Earl did at centre for the final half hour in Cardiff.
Pictures tell a thousand words, especially of thousand-yard stares.  (Supplied)
Let's leave this section short.
The clip of former Wales front row Adam Jones staring into space somewhere in the bowels of the Principality Stadium said it all.
At least it's all over now.

Having been battered by France last time out, Ireland needed a big response to end the tournament on a high — and they didn't provide it.
Italy's ill-discipline — they played 30 minutes of the match a player down due to yellow cards — is probably all that kept Ireland ahead.
Three missed conversions from Jack Crowley certainly didn't help, but Jamison Gibson-Park was subdued, centres Garry Ringrose and Robbie Henshaw were poor and even livewire flanker Josh van der Flier was strangely quiet.
James Lowe remains a beast and showed that on one wing, with Hugo Keenan perfectly adequate at fullback, while Mack Hansen showed what the Irish missed last week with some impressive runs.
Front row forwards Andrew Porter, Dan Sheehan and Tadhg Furlong were all fine as well.
Perhaps it was a case of it being relegated to the third choice game on this final Saturday of action, geographically far away from where all the action was taking place in northern Europe.
Perhaps it was just a symptom of knowing the Championship had all but gone and there was little, if anything to play for.
But that attitude won't win Lions Tours, where more players aren't selected for the Test team than not.

Scotland may have felt they were in with a chance of doing something really special in Paris, particularly when Tom Jordan crashed over to end a brilliant counterattack just before the break to give Scotland the lead.
But alas, as has been the case for Scotland all tournament, fine margins came back to hurt them.
In this case, the brilliant Blair Kinghorn was judged to have just hit the sideline before recycling the ball and the try was chalked off. France never looked back.
It's been the story of Scotland's tournament, playing some magical rugby only to either switch off and get caught on the counter, or just failing to find the line when they needed to.
A lack of cutting edge is hard to pin point — on paper this team is thrilling. For the first 40 minutes against France it was they who were lighting up Saint-Denis in their light-blue change strip, not the hosts.
With Finn Russell pulling the strings, Darcy Graham and Jordan roaring through midfield and the immense power of Duhan van der Merwe, this team should be putting teams to bed.

Carlos Alcaraz opts against supporting Novak Djokovic-led PTPA lawsuit,filed the lawsuit earlier this week,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-21/miami-open-carlos-alcaraz-novak-djokovic-ptpa-lawsuit/105079666,"World number three Carlos Alcaraz has distanced himself from the class-action lawsuit filed by the Professional Tennis Players' Association (PTPA) against the governing bodies of the sport.
The PTPA, an advocacy group established by Novak Djokovic and Vasek Pospisil, filed the lawsuit earlier this week.
It accused the ATP, WTA, International Tennis Federation and International Tennis Integrity Agency of anti-competitive practices.
Novak Djokovic's Professional Tennis Players' Association has sued the sport's governing bodies, with Australian Nick Kyrgios among the players attaching their name to the lawsuit.
The PTPA said the governing bodies were also disregarding player welfare and in one section of the 163-page document included a quote from four-time major champion Alcaraz, who had criticised the hectic tennis calendar last September.
""It was surprising for me, because no-one had told me about it,"" Alcaraz said at a Miami Open media conference.
""Yesterday I saw on social media that they put something I said in a press conference in the documents and I wasn't aware of it.
""I honestly don't support that letter because I wasn't aware of it.""
The ATP rejected the PTPA's claims and said the advocacy group was guilty of ""division and distraction"".
The WTA described the lawsuit as ""regrettable and misguided"".
Djokovic said he does not want the lawsuit to create a rift in tennis.
But he insisted the players' share of revenue needed to increase.
""I've never been a fan and supporter of division in our sport,"" Djokovic said.
""But I've always fought for better representation and influence of and positioning of the players globally in our sport, which I think is still not where I think it should be.""
Pospisil said the PTPA had spoken to more than 300 players and had significant support.
Nick Kyrgios, one of the 12 current and former players named as plaintiffs along with the PTPA in the US suit in New York, said it marked a ""special moment"".

Fremantle Dockers AFLW player Emma O'Driscoll on how ADHD shapes her,By Johanna McDiarmid,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-22/adhd-neurodivergence-sport-aflw-emma-o-driscoll-anxiety/105053164,"Growing up, AFLW player Emma O'Driscoll thought she had an anxiety disorder.
""I'd complain about feeling nervous all the time,"" the Fremantle Dockers defender tells ABC Sport.
""I'd get really worried about exams and I was always bad with time management.
""My time management still is very poor.""
It wasn't until the 24-year-old started playing elite sport that she decided to investigate further.
""I'd never sat down with a psychologist and tried to nut out this anxiety, especially when it was affecting my performance,"" O'Driscoll says.

The result of that investigation was an ADHD diagnosis.
""I did not have any idea that I would be considered someone with a neurodivergent brain,"" she says.
O'Driscoll has been on Fremantle's roster since 2020, and played more than 50 games.
She was recently named in the AFLW's All Australian team for the second year in a row.
""1,000 per cent I would not be the footballer I am without ADHD,"" she says.
""I use it as a strength, it's who I am as a person, it's part of me and it makes me play the way that I do.""
She describes her playing style as like a cat on a hot tin roof.
""I'm so wide eyed, I'm so locked in,"" she says.

""This energy is what makes me play my best footy and it's something that my teammates thrive off.
""I can zone in to where the ball is, to where my opponent is. The fact that I can provide energy and hype to the team is incredible.""
ADHD can be described as a neurological condition, to do with changes in the structure of the brain.
There are three subtypes, in which issues can range from trouble with attention, organisation and motivation, to impulsivity and hyperactivity.
Senior Clinical Psychologist Caroline Stevenson says women are often diagnosed with ADHD later in life.
""Women are more likely to have the inattentive subtype of ADHD,"" she says.
""If they have that, ADHD rarely occurs on its own, and a condition that goes with inattentive ADHD is anxiety.""
Inattentive ADHD is where there are difficulties with focus, attention and organisation. Dr Stevenson says it often goes unnoticed in girls.
""The boys get recognised because they tend to have behaviour problems, whereas the girls with [inattentive] ADHD, they don't.""
Many professional athletes have shared their ADHD diagnoses, with perhaps the most prominent being United States gymnast Simone Biles and swimmer Michael Phelps.
There has been little research when it comes to neurodiversity and elite sport, but one review published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine (BJSM) found ADHD affected 7 per cent to 8 per cent of elite athletes, compared to an estimated 2.5 per cent of the general adult population.
And in 2023, former AFLW player, psychologist and researcher Associate Professor Erin Hoare published a review with Deakin University, concluding there was some evidence to suggest an over-representation of neurodivergent people in elite sport.
The BJSM review found a reason for over-representation could be that children with ADHD may be drawn to sport, because physical activity can improve attention.
Dr Stevenson says sport can be a double-edged sword for those with ADHD.
""I think there's a lot of parents that put their kids into sport to burn up some of the energy,"" she says.
""There's an equal number of kids that I would say fail big time in group sport because they can't follow instructions, they're silly and the coaches get cross with them.
Sport can be a double-edged sword for kids, and which way it goes can depend on who's coaching them. (Getty Images)
""But then you get these extraordinarily special coaches that get these kids.""
Dr Stevenson says for some people with ADHD, sport can be an absolute game changer — especially when it comes to using things like hyper focus, impulsivity and lots of energy.
""The problem with ADHD is that you can be very distracted, [and] what happens when you hyper focus is the reverse,"" she says.
""It's like you've got blinkers on, and you can just see one thing.
""I'm 100 per cent sure that impulsivity is an advantage in sport because it means that you can make snap decisions, and you're not scared.
O'Driscoll says she plays like a ""cat on a hot tin roof"". (Getty Images: Brendon Thorne)
""You will go for the ball when other people won't, which is an absolute strength, so you've got that combination of hyper focus and speed and the ability to make a decision.
""You'd absolutely have an edge.""
It's thought an ADHD brain has lower levels of the neurotransmitters dopamine and norepinephrine than a neurotypical brain.
Some people with ADHD use medication to increase these levels, but Dr Stevenson says exercise can have a similar effect.

""You can use it [in] conjunction with medication or as an alternative to medication,"" she says.
""Medications are brilliant if they work for you, and if they don't have masses of side effects.
""[When] medications are not viable options, we're getting the same effects of increases of dopamine and norepinephrine off exercise and we can use it therapeutically.
""So that first bit in the day, getting up and exercising, you're going to get the same effect as Ritalin for a couple of hours post the exercise.

""With exercise you get it [dopamine] faster, but with medication you get it for longer. So the combination can work quite well.""
O'Driscoll says she doesn't use medication when she's playing footy.
""I think I like [being] a bit on edge,"" she says.
""I kind of use my ADHD in terms of the hyperactive, but that really fixated type to my advantage.""
While ADHD may work to an athlete's advantage on the field, evidence suggests it can have negative effects off it, including over-committing.
""I put so much on my plate to the point where it's not sustainable,"" O'Driscoll says.

Dr Stevenson says putting too many things in the same day is common, and another way to increase adrenaline, which is a precursor of dopamine.
She says she'll often have conversations with patients about procrastination.
""So, you delay, delay, delay and then you get a really big hit of adrenaline,"" she says.
""Running late or putting too much in your day is the same thing.
""You're putting pressure on yourself constantly by the adrenaline hit that you're getting.
""I can tell you that most of the time what people with ADHD are doing is playing with their biochemistry.""
Now with her diagnosis, O'Driscoll has the knowledge and the tools to develop strategies that help her balance her commitments off the field. And know her body on it.
""It has provided so much clarity as to why I've always felt this way,"" she says.
""It opened my eyes to over committing and having realistic expectations, where it's then reducing that anxiety.
O'Driscoll now has the resources and support around her to play on with confidence. (AFL Photos via Getty Images: Dylan Burns)
""I've got the resources and help around me, whether that's medication or talking to psychologists.
""I'm totally comfortable now talking about it and knowing there's no stigma around what you have to do to ensure your mental health is thriving.""
When it comes to creating more inclusive environments for people who are neurodivergent, O'Driscoll has this advice.

Socceroos move closer to World Cup with 5-1 win over Indonesia in Sydney,By Henry Hanson,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-20/socceroos-indonesia-fifa-world-cup-qualifier-live/105077682,"The Socceroos have edged closer to World Cup qualification after a lively 5-1 win over Indonesia in Sydney.
The Australians remain second in their qualification group, but now have some breathing space from the chasing pack, with the top two teams directly advancing to next year's World Cup in the United States, Canada, and Mexico.
They next face China on Tuesday.
""I aim quite high, so I'd say they're not where we want to be,"" Socceroos coach Tony Popovic said.
""But that's not a negative, that's a positive. They've taken strides forward.
""We all want to get better, to try to improve the game style. How do we identify what is happening on the field quicker?
""That will happen with more games together, and unfortunately with a lot of injuries it's hard to build that continuity.
""But what we are building is squad depth. I felt that this camp is the first time I felt in training and around the hotel that this group is now starting to build into what we're trying to build.""
Indonesia started with plenty of intent and earned a penalty, but Kevin Diks hit the woodwork, giving the Socceroos a huge reprieve.
Lewis Miller was then brought down at the other end, and after VAR intervention a penalty was awarded, allowing Martin Boyle to cooly convert.

Nishan Velupillay found himself one on one with the goalkeeper and calmly chipped it over to find the back of the next, and Jackson Irvine slotted the third giving the Socceroos a 3-0 lead at half-time.
Craig Goodwin's superb corner delivery found an unmarked Miller who headed in the Socceroos' fourth, while the Indonesians scored a deserved goal through Ole Romeny.
Irvine capped off the dominant win with his second goal, a commanding header from another sublime Goodwin inswinger.

Thank you very much for joining me and Amanda tonight - we had an absolute ball bringing you all the action from a very odd World Cup qualifier.
The Socceroos were undoubtedly second best between the boxes, but, over and over again, got the better of Indonesia when in them.
A clinical 5-1 victory and a huge step towards next year's tournament.
See you back here on Tuesday evening, when we'll do it all again for Australia's clash with China. Until then, go well!
By Amanda Shalala
Socceroos coach Tony Popovic is pleased with the win but not content with the performance overall.
""Defensively we weren't great today. We were a little bit on edge, sloppy defending,"" he said.
""Getting the (first) goal settled everyone down.
""It's what you want to be part of, you want to be part of something special that can get through these moments.""
Popovic says he finally feels like things are clicking into place in his tenure.
""This window... is the first time I felt in training and just around the hotel that this group is now starting to build into something that we're trying to do,"" he said.
""Proud of what I saw tonight to be head coach in Sydney, hometown, is just special.""
By Amanda Shalala
Jackson Irvine scored his first international goal at the SFS nearly eight years ago - so he told the media it's fitting that he added a couple more tonight.
""From a personal point of view, special night.
I never take it for granted being here. Haven't played in the stadium since that night almost eight years ago.
But this is a new time, new shirt, new everything. And I had a good feeling when I put it on the first time, it might have been a good night.""
By Amanda Shalala
Indonesia coach Patrick Kluivert says his side's missed penalty was a turning point, and the players never recovered from that.
""I think in the beginning of the game, we did a very good job in pressing high on the right side where we wanted to press, because we know on the left side they have good players.
After that, we received the penalty. If you shoot the penalty, it will be a totally different match.
And that in that moment, we changed something in our minds or something, but we didn't play our play anymore.
I think that we fought like lions, we never dropped down our heads.
But unfortunately, I'm very disappointed for the result, not only for us, for the people, for everybody who is supporting Indonesia.""
By Henry Hanson
And so he might.
The right wing back was everywhere tonight, and, playing his club football in Scotland, he says he wasn't quite prepared for a sweltering Sydney evening.
""First time back in Aus and the weather was killing me! I'm used to five degrees,"" Miller told Network 10.
""Obviously it was a good hit-out today, and the boys were unbelievable tonight weren't we.""
A great performance and well taken goal from Miller.
By Henry Hanson
Player of the match Jackson Irvine is talking to Network 10, and he has mixed feelings about tonight's performance, despite the 5-1 scoreline.
""We want to be a team that controls possession far better than we did today,"" Irvine said.
""We probably weren't good enough in possession for 90 minutes to be honest, but they came with more intensity than I've faced in a home game in a while.
""Man against man, it just felt like full pelt pressing for 90 minutes, all over us.
""It's hard to play possession style football when you're constantly under pressure.""
But he's happy with his team's flexibility in the face of that Indonesian intensity.
""What we had to do was, when we broke the pressure, then be clinical,"" Irvine said.
""And the times that we did break through we looked like we were gonna score.
""There were aspects of the game that are pleasing, a lot we could have done better.""
By Amanda Shalala
Great result for Australia but ever there was a scoreline that didn't match the result.... But the Socceroos have been on the wrong end of a few before. 2 more wins please

The Indonesians had many bright moments in that match Pete and you're right, the final score didn't do them any justice.
By Henry Hanson
It's a clinical performance, if ever there was one.
It's a Tony Popovic performance, if ever there was one.
The Socceroos sat back, absorbed pressure and let Indonesia dictate much of the play.
Indonesia looked brilliant between the boxes and finished the game with 60% of the ball.
But Australia was lethal on the counter-attack.
Nishan Velupillay was instrumental in the first half and Craig Goodwin's set-piece delivery was impeccable in the second.
5-1, and it's a statement win from Australia.
By Amanda Shalala
Nice to see us doing well from corners. For so long we have been so bad at this basic part of the game.

Is there a sweeter sight then Jackson Irvine towering above the pack to score? You love to see it.
By Henry Hanson
It's a commanding header from Jackson Irvine and it's ANOTHER wonderful corner from Craig Goodwin.
He fires in another in swinging peach and it's all too easy for Irvine, who rises like a salmon and thunders it in with his forehead.
Two for Irvine, two set-piece assists for half-time substitute Goodwin.
By Henry Hanson
It's a fine save from Matt Ryan - not his first of the evening.
Eliano Reijnders, on debut, hits it low and hard but Ryan is equal to it.
By Henry Hanson
And don't the visitors deserve it.
Indonesia has dominated much of tonight's play and finally have something to show for it.
Ole Romeny gets on the end of a Kevin Diks pass, who expertly juggles it over and through Jason Geria and it's an assured finish past Matt Ryan.
A debut goal for Indonesia's standout player.
It's our northern neighbour's first in Australia since the 1970s and first against the Socceroos since 1981.
By Amanda Shalala
It's pretty close to a full house, with the crowd confirmed at 35,241 for the Socceroos' first match at the SFS since 2017.
By Henry Hanson
An incisive, dancing run from Romeny and he finds himself at the byline.
He flashes a delicious looking cut-back across the face of goal but there's no one on the end of it.
One of those nights for Indonesia.
By Henry Hanson
It has been a bit stop start since that fourth goal and the wind has fallen out of Indonesia's sails.
Goalscorers Lewis Miller and Nishan Velupillay are off and Daniel Arzani and the returning Fran Karacic are on.

Kimberley athletes feeling tyranny of distance as costs of national competitions mount,By Vanessa Mills,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-22/isolated-athletes-spend-thousands-to-compete-state-nationals/105047886,"Jasper Barnett spends much her time training underwater in a small public pool in Western Australia's north.
At just 13 years old, the 50m butterfly and backstroke specialist from Broome already has a swag of medals and records from local and state meets.
She's also a talented surf lifesaver, training for ocean races at Cable Beach, which has postcard views but the added threat of stingers, sharks, and crocodiles.
""I prefer the pool because it's more safe,"" she said.
Jasper only competes twice a year, 2,000 kilometres south in Perth, and has to re-adjust to swimming in a pool double the size of the one in her home town.
In 2024, Jasper Barnett won six gold medals at the WA state titles and later set a new 50m butterfly record. (Supplied: Yuki Barnett)
""I aim for two to three breaths in 50 metres. It's a more efficient way to not break your streamline when trying to go the fastest,"" Jasper said.
Over the next month, Jasper will tackle one of her biggest competitive campaigns, with the Australian Surf Life Saving Championships on the Gold Coast quickly followed by the National Swim Championships in Brisbane.

Jasper, who competes as an individual rather than in a club, has a month of training prior to the national events with specialist pool and ocean swimming coaches in Perth and Queensland.
But it doesn't come cheap.
Her family has been fundraising to cover almost $15,000 for flights, hotels, food, coaching fees, and equipment.
""Even when we go to Perth for the state championships we're still looking at $10,000, and it's always been that way unfortunately,"" her father Brent Barnett said.
""For Jasper, it's always been three weeks off school and specialised training in the 50-metre pool.
It's a scenario echoed across regional Australia, where families and clubs frequently fundraise for athletes to get to the city.
The AFL is one of the few sports to have structured and well-funded support programs for country athletes.
Broome Little Athletics Centre (BLAC) has almost 200 members and was named Best Remote Organisation in Australia by its peak body in 2023.
""Young talent in the Kimberley and other regional areas are already disadvantaged compared to metro athletes due to not having the facilities to train,"" club president Kelly Ford said.

Ms Ford estimated families were paying almost $3,000 for their child to compete at various state meets in Perth.
She said it was essential to keep youth ""engaged in the sports they love"".
""If we don't enable them to easily travel to competitions I fear they'll lose interest and give up the sport completely,"" Ms Ford said.
One of BLAC's rising stars is track and field athlete Annabella Thompson, who has attended state, national, and international competitions.
But Ms Ford said there was ""hardly any"" financial support for the teenager from government bodies.
Applications needed to be submitted more than six weeks prior, not often possible for athletes, and other criteria usually ruled out children under 13 or prevented interstate travel.
Ms Ford said the young athlete moved to Perth this year to ""follow her dreams"".

Ms Ford said BLAC regularly sought grants, donations, and sponsorship and praised small businesses for their generosity.
""If there was more support for our athletes we may be able to keep them engaged longer — a lot more needs to be done in this area,"" she said.
""Mostly the families of athletes work out a way to be able to pay.""",ABC News,sports
Joe Ingles gets first NBA start for Minnesota Timberwolves so son can see him play,JBy Jon Healy,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-22/joe-ingles-starts-for-first-time-in-nba-season-so-son/105084708,"Joe Ingles's last start in an NBA game was in January 2022, so it understandably raised some eyebrows when the Aussie was announced as one of Minnesota's guards against New Orleans.
But it was revealed shortly before the game that Timberwolves coach Chris Finch had given Ingles the start for reasons beyond basketball.
Ingles has not played a minute for the Wolves for almost the past month, which included sitting on the bench for the entirety of Sunday's game against former team Utah.
Unfortunately, that coincided with a milestone night for the Ingles family, with wife Renae and children Jacob, Milla and Jack travelling the length of the country from Orlando to Minnesota to watch.
As it turned out, it marked the first time eight-year-old Jacob, whose autism can cause sensory overload, had made it through a whole game in the stands.
""Watching him soak in every moment, I couldn't help but tear up with pride,"" former Australian netball star Renae Ingles posted on Instagram.
""It's been 6 years of hard work, dedication, and perseverance to reach this point, and here we are, riding high on this incredible achievement.""
So, with the Ingles family in the stands to watch the Timberwolves again on Saturday (AEDT), Finch gave Ingles the nod to start for the first time in 1,147 days.
Renae said the gesture left her ""speechless with gratitude"".

""Tonight was truly bigger than basketball for us and our family,"" she said on her Instagram stories.
""For Chris, the team and the whole organisation to support Joe and our family the way they did tonight, particularly Jacob, is truly incredible.
""This is a night that we will, as a family, remember forever. There have been many tears today.
""I am so proud of the person and teammate that Joe is, because the fact the team would do something like this for him is truly a reflection of that.""
The retired Diamonds star said getting to the point where Jacob could not only attend but engage and enjoy the night ""truly took years and years of work and practice and getting it wrong"".
""So much sacrifice to get to this point, so it just feels really nice this week that Joe and I can feel like we are making the right choices for Jacob and his needs,"" she said.
""But it's not all rainbows. I just want to let you know that if you are one of those parents that it is not working for at the moment, or you are trying these things and it's not succeeding, we still have those days and those moments too, and that's OK.
""But you do need to enjoy it when you can and we are soaking all of the love up from this last week.""
Joe only played the first six minutes of the game, recording an assist before subbing out for Donte DiVincenzo as the Timberwolves completed a 134-93 victory.
""It was emotional. Sometimes you've got to do the human thing,"" Finch said after the game.
We always talk about 'all these minutes matter', and those minutes mattered for another reason.
""Someone put it in my head today as an idea to make sure Joe can see the floor and I figured if we're going to do it, let's do it in style.""
Since Jacob's diagnosis, the Ingles have been vocal ambassadors for a number of autism causes and charities, including 4ASD Kids, and have helped champion sensory rooms at sporting venues in Utah, Milwaukee, Orlando and Melbourne.
""I just don't think people understand,"" Joe said after the game.
""There's a little less stress because I can afford to pay for Jacob to get what he needs, but it doesn't take away the meltdowns in the supermarket. … You can feel people staring at you. You know they're judging, you know they're making comments about it, but they have no idea what he's gone through that day or the night before or the situation.
""Ever since he was diagnosed, it's been what we've tried to do with [raising] the awareness of, like, this shit is real.""

Ingles played the first eight seasons of his NBA career with the Utah Jazz before having one-season stints with the Bucks and Magic and then arriving in Minnesota before the 2024/25 season.
The 37-year-old admitted after the game Jacob ""doesn't really care"" that he plays basketball.
""He wants his dad home,"" he told reporters.

Broncos beat Cowboys in Queensland derby after Warriors' win over Roosters,"Thu, 20 Mar3024→",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-21/nrl-live-blog-warriors-roosters-broncos-cowboys/105078938,"The Broncos have beaten the Cowboys 26-16 in a scrappy Queensland derby at Lang Park after the Warriors showed their mettle in a 14-6 win over the Roosters.
The Cowboys lost their third straight game to start the NRL season in another error-strewn outing, although Brisbane fullback Reece Walsh was similarly wayward on the night.
Coming off a rough outing against Canberra in round two, Walsh booted a pivotal first-half 40/20 and threw a lovely long ball for a Jesse Arthars try, but also came up with five errors according to NRL.com and was put on report for a shoulder charge.
At time during the game Walsh was seen hitting himself in the head in frustration, when five-eighth Ben Hunt moved to console him.
Speaking to ABC Sport, Hunt said the team wanted him to focus on nailing the simple stuff to unleash his brilliance.

""We know the magic Reece can do,"" Hunt said.
""He's working extremely hard. We encourage him to let it go and focus on his defence.
Broncos coach Michael Maguire said the team was ""clunky"" but showed impressive spirit in the victory.
""It was a really good test of our character,"" Maguire said in his post-match media conference.
""""To see the way they defended and their connection, it was great.""
Both Maguire and captain Adam Reynolds praised Walsh for organising the defence on a night where the Broncos repelled repeat sets on their line.
""Reece will be right. I've had plenty of players in situations like that. Every now and then a player goes through it,"" Maguire said.
""[He needs to] keep at it. I've had players that are like Reece. It helps define who you are. He'll be better for it when he keeps working his way through it.""

""[He needs to] keep at it. I've had players that are like Reece. It helps define who you are. He'll be better for it when he keeps working his way through it.""
Both Maguire and captain Adam Reynolds credit Walsh with organising the defence and being a key reason they kept repelling the Cowboys on their line.

Coach Todd Payten says the errors in that game suggest ""a side that's low on confidence"".
""We're in a tough spot and there's no magic bullet, no pill we can take. It's hard work and graft,"" he says.
""It'll turn we've just got to make it turn. I'm seeing them work really hard at the moment.""
Payten jokes he has concerns for his ""sanity"" and the club is feeling the pressure, but seems to be trying to shift focus off his own job security.
He reveals Viliami Vailea has gone to hospital after getting that nasty scratch on the eye early in the game.

Brisbane fullback Reece Walsh has had a rough couple of weeks and has been visibly upset by his performances.
Two games in a row he's been well below his best, although he did have a lovely highlight with a long ball for a Jesse Arthars try in the second half.
Ben Hunt was seen trying to console him during the game and tells ABC Sport they need to help him focus on nailing the simple stuff.
""We know the magic Reece can do,"" Hunt says.
""He's working extremely hard. We encourage him to let it go and focus on his defence.
""He can get pretty down on himself.""
NRL.com accredited five errors to him tonight. That number seems a little high, but he was far more like last week's Reece Walsh than he was 2023 Reece Walsh.
By Jon Healy
Brisbane rediscover their composure to hold off the Cowboys 26-16.
The Broncos will be happy to get the win, but they were let off the hook more than a few times by their distant northern neighbours, who move to 0-3 for the season.
By Jon Healy
Deine Mariner drops the ball cold as the Broncos attack down the right and Jaxon Purdue swoops, immediately getting into his stride and outpacing Reece Walsh and the rest of the Broncos to go 90 metres and score.
Scott Drinkwater hits the post and that miss means they have to score two more tries, rather than a try and a long-range field goal or penalty goal to tie the game.
By Jon Healy
Adam Reynolds grubbers into the in-goal and Reece Walsh seems to have it at his mercy, but he pulls out of the contest as Scott Drinkwater arrives. He appeals for taken out off the ball, but he wasn't.
Regardless, the Broncos get a repeat set as Jeremiah Nanai is taken dead in goal.
By Jon Healy
It's men against boys out there whenever Payne Haas gets the ball, albeit aided by some miserable defence.
He gets it 30 metres out one off the ruck and he just skips between Reuben Cotter and Jordan McLean, swerves around Scott Drinkwater and dives in.
The way Michael Maguire is using him — giving him a break in the middle of the game like a more traditional prop rather than playing 65 minutes straight — is really maximising his impact.
By Jon Healy
He jumps down the short side and tries a chip and chase on the last, but kicks out on the full.
I know it doesn't matter much in this context because they haven't lost many metres, but it just feels like the opposite of what he needs mentally at this point.
By Jon Healy
Reece Walsh falls into a Reece Robson tackle and is collected high, giving Adam Reynolds a shot at a penalty goal.
He pots it for a 20-12 lead and moves from 2,374 points to 2,376, taking him past Jarrod Croker into third spot on the points tally, behind Cameron Smith (2,786) and Hazem El Masri (2,418).
By Jon Healy
Sam McIntyre comes in for a yardage run from centre and knocks it on in the tackle. The Cowboys are immediately back under the pump.
By Jon Healy
The Broncos retake the lead as they just strip the Cowboys for numbers far too easily and Reece Walsh launches a long ball over the top to Jesse Arthars to score.
It wasn't a particularly slick play, but attacking the side with the manufactured defensive structure after the loss of Viliami Vailea, it didn't need to be perfect.
That came on the back of a run of set restarts too. The Cowboys looked gassed and were frankly lucky not to have anyone sin-binned.
And hopefully landing that pass will give Walsh a little confidence boost.
By Jon Healy
Selwyn Cobbo has looked pretty slow and generally not great tonight, but he's just ignited the Broncos with a massive charge, launching Griffin Neame out of the way.
Pat Carrigan keeps the momentum going, and Adam Reynolds grubbers into the in-goal for a repeat set.
By Jon Healy
After chance upon chance upon chance, the Cowboys finally put it through the hands and get the ball out to Murray Taulagi. He outpaces Selwyn Cobbo and dives in on the left.
Scott Drinkwater has a chance to level the scores from the sideline and nails it!
By Jon Healy
Scott Drinkwater grubbers in behind Selwyn Cobbo and Murray Taulagi has the line at his mercy. But he stands over the ball as it trickles towards the tryline and knocks it on.
Reece Walsh flies across to try to break it up and collides with Taulagi, but he's penalised for a shoulder charge.
Gee, I think that's tough.
By Jon Healy
The high kick into the corner is spilled again by the Broncos, this time it's Walsh, and the visitors are on the attack from 10 metres out.
Broncos look exhausted and Walsh is looking more like he did last week, which isn't good news for Brisbane.
A set restart, and back-to-back penalties for the Cowboys right in front of the posts.
The first, on Xavier Willison for lying in the ruck, was fair enough, but Cory Paix is pinged for a strip hat is very harsh for mine.
By Jon Healy
The Broncos fullback digs into the line off the scrum and knocks on in the tackle from Jake Clifford. Then, in his frustration, gives away a penalty in the ensuing tackle. Although I think that's a harsh call from Todd Smith.
Walsh is bashing himself in the head and berating himself as Ben Hunt puts an arm around him and tries to snap him out of it.

Hawks defeat Blues in bruising AFL blockbuster at MCG to remain unbeaten,"Thu, 20 Mar6080→",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-20/afl-round-two-blues-vs-hawks-live-blog/105078286,"Hawthorn have gone 3-0 for the first time in 11 years, outlasting an improved but tiring Carlton by 20 points in a gritty contest at the MCG.
Coming off a nightmare defeat to Richmond seven days earlier, the Blues trailed by just five points at three-quarter-time on Thursday night and appeared primed to upset the ""Hollywood Hawks''.
But Mabior Chol and James Sicily, who again swung forward from defence, booted crucial goals to open the final term, setting up Hawthorn's 12.8 (80) to 8.12 (60) triumph.
Explosive small forward Nick Watson made it a certainty midway through the final term, bombing his second goal of the game to spark trademark celebrations from the Hawks.
The buzz team of 2025, who have surged into premiership favouritism, Hawthorn have recorded their best start to a season since 2014, a year when they won the second premiership of their three-peat.

""We knew that the game was going to be a tough one, and we had to produce some pretty good footy to get over the line,"" Hawks coach Sam Mitchell said.
""To get the win, we probably had a little bit of luck in it.
""I'm pleased that we're able to come out of it, but it's probably not our best performance either.""

Chol slotted three goals in an important display up forward on a night when showers in Melbourne made conditions slippery.
Hawthorn suffered a blow in the second quarter when half-forward Connor Macdonald (ankle) had to be subbed out, replaced by veteran triple premiership player Jack Gunston.
But Gunston, in his first game of the season, slotted two crucial goals during the third quarter in a vital contribution.
Jai Newcombe (32 possessions) and Will Day (26) were outstanding in the midfield for the Hawks.

Well, Thursday night footy isn't half bad is it?
What fantastic back-to-back Thursday evening games.  Although, perhaps not if you're a Blues supporter (sorry).
Hawthorn are now top of the ladder with three wins on the trot - Giants also have two wins but have a bye this weekend - while Carlton find themselves in a bit of a slog with two losses to start the season.

""The season has just been awesome,"" Josh Battle told Fox Footy post-win.
Battle switched colours from St Kilda at the end of last season and has seemingly gelled seamlessly with his new club.
""It's always tough coming in, learning new terminology, learning a new system, but no, the coaches, the other boys down there, they've been amazing,"" he said.
Battle added that the Hawks like moving the ball quickly, using their overlap with pace, which helps them get ahead of their opposition. All which fans saw tonight.
By Marnie Vinall
For three quarters, it was a tough and tight contest that felt like it could tilt either way.
There was just five points in it at three-quarter time, but then Hawthorn pulled away with three goals to none in the final quarter to steal the win.
In the end, the won it somewhat comfortably, as Carlton just were unable to chase the attacking Hawks in the final minutes.
The Hawks now start their season with three straight wins (Sydney, Essendon, Carlton) and remain undefeated. Meanwhile, the Blues have recorded back-to-back losses to start their year.
Hawthorn defeat Carlton 12.8 (80) to 8.12 (60).

Just as I was going to say it doesn't matter that James Sicily hasn't kicked a goal at full forward because he has been taking out Carlton's best defender so the other Hawks could get to work... he scored.
Sicily took a great contested mark and then kicked the ball straight through the big sticks. A real captain's moment as it extends his side's lead in an important moment.

Hawks fans are up and on their feet for Mabior Chol, who has kicked his third goal of the evening.
It extends Hawthorn's lead to a 10-point margin.
It's about this point Carlton fans would really be starting to wonder where Charlie Curnow is.

Wow, you can feel the suspense around the MCG as the crowd keep their voices heard.
Hawthorn were down by five points, less than a goal, at half-time and now lead by the same at three-quarter time.
What a game. It could go either way from here with the stage set for an exciting final term.

James Sicily has been swung to full forward with some positional changes from Sam Mitchell.
He's now matched-up with one of the premier defenders in the competition in Jacob Weitering.
Footy fans are being treated tonight.

Carlton are not lying down or giving up tonight.
Jesse Motlop received the ball outside a contest and with advantage called, ran it to goal. He's fighting hard.

It's Zac Williams who has stopped Hawthorn's run of goals with one of his own, his second of the night.
It's an important goal, which drags the game back to within two goals.

It's the super sub Jack Gunston with another goal for the Hollywood Hawks.
That's five in a row now for Hawthorn, while Carlton are really being put on the back foot.
This is about the point the Blues were really challenged by Richmond last week and let the game slide... can they regain some composure tonight against an even stronger opponent?
Michael Voss has started to pace in the coaches' box.

The ball spilled out of a contest deep in Hathorn's forward 50, where Mabior Chol was ready to receive it.
The momentum seems to be well and truly with the Hawks now, who have kicked the last three.

Hawthorn moved the ball with pace out of their defence and into their attack.
Jack Ginnivan had a great centring kick to Moore, who was waiting for it in front of goals. From there, it was no issues for Moore.
Swingman James Sicily has also been thrown forward.

Eddie Betts has reported on Fox Footy that it's just a blood nose for Sam Walsh and you'd expect his return at some point this game.
Meanwhile, Tom de Koning has the chance for a quick response but the ball sailed into the woodwork.
Still, the behind gives Carlton back the lead.

By Marnie Vinall
That's a terrible sight for Carlton fans: Sam Walsh has come from the ground looking in a fair amount of discomfort.
In opposing colours, it's all smiles, as Hawthorn get a goal through Jack Gunston.
Jack Silvagni had an opportunity to kick the first goal of the second half but his kick was offline.
Scores level
By Marnie Vinall
No goals yet this half, but some interesting footy.
Patrick Cripps is going head-to-head with Connor Nash, after previously going up against Jai Newcombe. He's causing havoc in the contest and doing everything he can to keep his side in front.
Just behind the Carlton captain is George Hewett with 16 touches in the disposable count (Cripps on 17).

Wallabies star Fraser McReight knocks back monster overseas offers to re-sign with Queensland Reds,Star Cats recruit ruled out of Saints clash as Power thump Tigers,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-14/rugby-union-wallabies-fraser-mcreight-reds-extension/105053942,"Fraser McReight's retention is proving the perfect mood maker as the Queensland Reds brace for a State of Origin-like Super Rugby Pacific derby with the NSW Waratahs.
McReight has shunned big-money international offers to remain at Ballymore beyond the 2027 home World Cup.
Regarded as one of the world's best number sevens, the 26-year-old Wallabies star confirmed a long-term contract extension on Friday.
It's a boost for the code in the country, and the Reds ahead of Saturday's blockbuster against the undefeated Waratahs at Suncorp Stadium.
McReight, two-time defending Australian Super Rugby player of the year, was sensational for club and country in 2024 and said he seriously considered accepting a huge overseas offer.
But, with the 2027 World Cup in Australia on the horizon, he's joined good mate and Wallabies captain Harry Wilson in committing to the domestic competition.
Reds hooker Matt Faessler and Brumbies lock Nick Frost both confirmed their contract extensions on Thursday as Wallabies coach Joe Schmidt steadily builds a list that will remain once he leaves his post after this year's Rugby Championship.
""I'm very happy to have my contract resolved for the next three years and I can concentrate on those good times ahead with the Reds, the Wallabies and my teammates,"" McReight said. ""There were other offers but my heart has always been with the Reds and the Wallabies.
""Queensland is my home and it means so much to represent my family and friends and playing for your country is the highest honour where you get to represent where you come from with pride.
""There are some huge events ahead in rugby in this country, and as a nation we are rebuilding and I want to be part of that.""
The Reds (2-1) have top-four aspirations this season and consider the Waratahs (3-0) clash a must-win fixture if that is to eventuate.
ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.
McReight says the Reds have mentally prepared for Origin-style encounter with their second-placed arch rivals.
""As game day and kick-off approaches, that's probably when you start to feel it's a bit different,"" he said.
""The crowds are a bit more packed because they want to see that Origin sort of style come out and that's definitely where you can feel it as a player.
""Playing the Tahs is such a great game with tradition and history against the two states.
""We've had a lot of good battles over the years and the Tahs are a great side who are undefeated and they're showing some awesome things.""
Knowing his side will have their hands full containing the Reds' back row of McReight, Wilson and Seru Uru, Waratahs coach Dan McKellar has opted for the big-bodied Leafi Talataina at number eight ahead of the in-form Langi Gleeson.
""I'm really excited about what Leafi, where we can take him as a rugby player,"" McKellar said.
""And Langi''s 100 per cent fit, so it's not like we're starting him here because Langi's 80 per cent or anything like that.
""We're starting him because I think he's the best man for the job this week and Langi will give us a real punch and impact off the bench.""

"NBA quick hits: Daniels's defensive excellence, LeBron and Curry's title hopes and the deal haunting the 76ers",CBy Chris De Silva,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-20/basketball-nba-daniels-lebron-curry-lakers-warriors/105075096,"The NBA season is fast approaching its conclusion as numerous teams in both conferences jostle for top six seeds ahead of this year's playoffs.
Australia's Dyson Daniels has continued to put up phenomenal defensive numbers, while two of the league's elder statesmen, LeBron James and Stephen Curry, have seen their title dreams revitalised courtesy of two trades.
Here are a few things to keep an eye on with the playoffs just weeks away.
It is no stretch to say Dyson Daniels is now one of the best perimeter defenders in the entire NBA.
The Atlanta Hawks may still be a middling team (they are 33-36 at the time of writing and sit seventh in the Eastern Conference), but Daniels has been one of the finds of the season.
Daniels has earned the excellent nickname of ""The Great Barrier Thief"" due to his propensity to steal the ball from opponents all season long, and he continues to rack up mind-numbing steal numbers.
The 22-year-old Bendigo native now has 194 steals on the season, which is the highest number by a single player since Chris Paul had 216 in 2008-09.
Daniels currently averages three steals per contest, the most by a player since Alvin Robertson averaged 3.04 for the Milwaukee Bucks during the 1990-91 season. If he maintains his current pace, he will easily surpass Paul's mark.
Standing at 203 centimetres, Daniels has proved to be the perfect complement for All-Star point guard Trae Young, who is not known as a defensive savant, to say the least.
The Aussie is present in Atlanta's four most effective five-man line-ups to have logged at least 50 minutes so far this season, and is virtually a lock to be named to one of the NBA's two All-Defensive teams this season.
Daniels has also seen upticks in virtually every other area of his game since arriving in Atlanta. He is currently averaging career-highs in points, rebounds, assists, steals and blocks as well as shooting a career-best 34.5 per cent from long range.
Daniels is currently still on his rookie contract, but is in line to receive a huge pay bump on his next deal, whether that is with the Hawks or a rival team.
It is amazing the impact two trades can have on not only two teams, but the entire league.
The NBA was flipped on its head in the first week of February when the Los Angeles Lakers acquired Luka Dončić in a clandestine trade with the Dallas Mavericks, a deal that still doesn't feel real more than a month later.
The Lakers were 28-19 when the Dončić trade was executed, and have soared since then, currently sitting fourth in the Western Conference with a record of 42-25 at the time of writing.
Dončić has been accompanied by LeBron James, Austin Reaves, Rui Hachimura and Jaxon Hayes in the Lakers' starting five when the roster is fully healthy, and that line-up has so far blown the doors off teams, outscoring them to the tune of 22.2 points per 100 possessions in 44 minutes on the floor together.

The Slovenian is the best playmaker James has played alongside in his 22 seasons, and the decreased offensive workload has allowed James to dial up his defensive intensity to levels not seen in years.
It is evident watching James play that the prospect of potentially adding another title as soon as this season has energised him. In the 10 games since the All-Star break, James — the oldest player in the league at 40 — has averaged 28.3 points, 10.5 rebounds and 6.4 assists per game.
A few days after the Lakers acquired Dončić, the Golden State Warriors' stumbling season was resuscitated by the acquisition of six-time All-Star forward Jimmy Butler, who arrived after falling out with the Miami Heat.
The Warriors had a record of 25-26 when they pulled the trigger on the Butler trade, and have been one of the best teams in the league since his arrival, going 15-3 in the last month of play.

Butler's arrival has infused the Warriors with limitless energy on the defensive end, where Draymond Green remains a menace and a Defensive Player of the Year candidate, while alleviating the pressure on Stephen Curry on the offensive end.
As James has since Dončić arrived, Curry has played his best basketball since Butler became his teammate. Curry, 37, has averaged 27.2 points per game since the All-Star break, almost four points higher than his average prior to the break.
Butler's arrival gives the Warriors an additional playmaker who allows Curry to do what he does best — relocating after giving up the ball and whizzing around numerous screens on any given possession.
The Oklahoma City Thunder (56-12) still remain the team to beat in the Western Conference (and maybe the entire NBA) but both the Lakers and Warriors have what the Thunder do not — real championship pedigree.
The Thunder would still be favoured in a series against either the Lakers or Warriors, but would 100 per cent rather not face an energised James or Curry.
In a less-heralded trade at the deadline, the Chicago Bulls made the decision to send Zach LaVine to the Sacramento Kings in a three-team deal which saw De'Aaron Fox head from the Kings to the San Antonio Spurs.
The deal seemed like a head-scratcher on the surface for the Bulls, who received their own 2025 first-rounder from the Spurs as well as Zach Collins, Tre Jones and Kevin Huerter.
However, one of the benefits of the deal has been the empowerment of Josh Giddey, who was acquired by the Bulls in a trade prior to the start of the season.
Life on the Bulls was initially a little awkward for Giddey as he shared ball-handling duties alongside high-usage guards LaVine and Coby White, but the Aussie has played some of his best basketball since LaVine's departure.

Giddey has regained the verve he displayed in his first two seasons, which was sorely missing last year as he progressively saw his minutes diminish as the season went on.
In the nine games Giddey has played since the All-Star break, he has averaged 23.1 points, 10.9 rebounds and 8.4 assists while knocking down over 52 per cent of his three-point shots.
Giddey can play off the ball — he is shooting a career-high 37 per cent from three in four attempts per game — but his real value comes on the ball, where he is an excellent creator from the guard spot.
The Bulls — currently ninth in the East with a 29-39 record — are unlikely to make this year's playoffs, but when Giddey has been on the floor, good things have happened.
Giddey is present in three of the Bulls' four best two-man line-ups, with the Bulls outscoring opponents by 28.2 points per 100 possessions in 161 minutes on the floor alongside Huerter.
While the race at the top of the league is always entertaining, we are at the point of the season where it is interesting to see teams jostling for lottery seedings as well at the bottom of the NBA.
The race to the bottom is more enticing due to the prize for the winner — Duke's Cooper Flagg, who is projected by many draft experts to be selected first overall.
Flagg, a 206cm forward has earned comparisons to Boston Celtics star Jayson Tatum. He is an accomplished three-level scorer, an excellent rebounder and a capable playmaker for his size, and is considered to be one of the most polished draft prospects in league history.
The Utah Jazz currently hold the worst record in the NBA with a record of 15-54, a game worse than the 15-52 Washington Wizards. The Charlotte Hornets and New Orleans Pelicans are the other teams yet to win 20 games so far this season.
The team with the fifth-worst record in the league at the time of writing, the 23-46 Philadelphia 76ers, are in perhaps the most interesting position of all the tanking teams.

Philadelphia entered the season harbouring hopes of an NBA title, but fell spectacularly as its star trio of Joel Embiid, Paul George and Tyrese Maxey all struggled to see extended minutes on the court together due to constant injuries.
If the Sixers pick falls to lower than sixth in this year's draft, it will be conveyed to the team with the league's best record — the Thunder — due to a 2020 trade in which the Sixers looked to shed the salary of Al Horford one season after signing him to a four-year, US$109 million deal by attaching a top-six protected 2025 first-round pick in the trade.
To make matters worse for Philly, Horford played just 28 games for the Thunder before re-signing with the Boston Celtics, where he played a key role in last year's NBA triumph.

Lando Norris not thinking about Formula 1 championship despite entering Chinese Grand Prix weekend as leader,MBy Michael Doyle,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-21/lando-norris-not-thinking-about-formula-1-championship/105060760,"Oscar Piastri has said the way he drove in during his home grand prix weekend, despite a late spin that cost him a podium finish, is how he wants to ""attack the rest of the season"".
The Melbourne-born McLaren driver was in a battle with his teammate Lando Norris for much of last Sunday's Australian Grand Prix, before a spin on lap 44 of 57 sent him tumbling down the order.
Piastri was able to salvage ninth place, but could only wonder what could have been as Norris took the race win.
With no time to dwell, F1 returns this weekend for the Chinese Grand Prix in Shanghai.
Speaking to media ahead of the weekend, Piastri said he has taken the many positives from Australia and plans to focus on that this weekend.
""The competitiveness of firstly the car, but also myself, from the weekend was a massive positive to take forward for the rest of the year,"" Piastri said.
""I think I started the weekend off, and the season off, on the note that I want to continue.
""I think the way I went about the weekend and the competitiveness I showed — that's how I want to attack the rest of the season.""

For Norris, his victory in last Sunday's season-opener means he enters this F1 weekend as the championship leader for the first time.
Norris solidified himself as a championship contender in 2025 with a terrific drive in the wet, and McLaren as the team to beat in the early stages of this season.
Jack Doohan's first home grand prix ended unceremoniously with a lap one crash, but the Queenslander says he needs to move on quickly ahead of next Sunday's race.
This weekend is also the first time since the Monaco Grand Prix 2022 that Max Verstappen has not entered the weekend as the drivers' championship leader.
Despite the excitement surrounding Norris, the 25-year-old British driver was quick to hose down any talk of the championships after just one of 24 grands prix this season.
""I'm not thinking about it. I don't really care about it. It shouldn't change anything I do. It shouldn't change what the team does,"" he said during Thursday's drivers' press conference in China.
""I had one good weekend — people need to calm down a little bit. I'm focused on trying to do the same here.
""I probably won't even think about the championship until at least halfway through the year.""
This weekend's Chinese Grand Prix will be the first with a sprint race this season.
Six weekends this season will feature a sprint race, including the Miami, Belgium, United States (Austin), Sau Paulo, and Qatar grand prix weekends.
This weekend, drivers will have just one free practice session before sprint qualifying and the sprint race are completed. In Melbourne, drivers and teams had three one-hour practice sessions to prepare the cars for the grand prix.
Following a four-year absence due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Max Verstappen won last year's Chinese Grand Prix.
It was the first time the Dutchman won at the Shanghai circuit and the third for Red Bull (Sebastian Vettel 2009, Daniel Ricciardo 2018).
Lewis Hamilton has been the master of the Shanghai International Circuit, which hosted its first F1 grand prix in 2004.
Hamilton won the race six times. Fernando Alonso is the only other active driver who has won the Chinese Grand Prix, claiming wins in 2005 and 2013.
McLaren has not stood on the top step in Shanghai since Hamilton triumphed in 2011.

"Endometriosis sufferers experiencing long delays for treatment, report finds, as SA government vows change",LBy Leah MacLennan,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-21/endometriosis-sufferers-experiencing-long-treatment-delays/105077112,"Deanna Flynn Wallis began experiencing the symptoms of endometriosis when she was 13.
She said she'd been sporty and athletic, and loved dance and acting, but suddenly she found she couldn't do all those things anymore.
It wasn't until she was 19 that she was diagnosed with the disease.
""I've now had over 15 procedures in my lifetime, multiple laparoscopies, multiple nerve blocks, botox. I've been put into temporary menopause four times,"" she said.
""I've suffered with infertility and miscarriages, I've lost two pregnancies, I've done IVF, I've fought to have a hysterectomy and I'm still battling the symptoms that just won't go away.
""Luckily since my hysterectomy, my lesions have reduced but I'm still left with the chronic nerve damage, chronic fatigue, brain fog, nausea, hair loss. You name it, I've got it.""
Ms Flynn Wallis says she has endured infertility and miscarriages. (Supplied)
Ms Flynn Wallis is one of dozens of people who gave evidence to a South Australian parliamentary committee into endometriosis.
The inquiry was established by Labor MP Catherine Hutchesson, herself an endometriosis sufferer.
""It is so important that we work hard to make sure everybody across our whole community knows about endometriosis, not just the sufferers,"" she said.
After a year of taking submissions and hearing from witnesses, the committee has handed down its report with 20 recommendations.
It found while at least one in seven Australian women have endometriosis, there are still major delays in diagnosis and treatment.
According to the report, that is mainly due to the social normalisation of pain, the lack of access to medical professionals and services, the cost of treatment, and a lack of knowledge and education among medical providers, adolescents, their families and carers.
Recommendations include boosting training for doctors and medical staff in the identification and management of endometriosis, the creation of a public health campaign and the improvement of education in schools.

Ms Hutchesson said girls and young women needed to know when their pain was not normal.
""[By] being able to do that, we will ensure that going forward we will be able to cut that pain cycle and make sure they get that help and support that they need.""
Health Minister Chris Picton said the South Australian government had agreed in principle to the recommendations.
""This is the line in the sand where we say that treatment has to be different,"" Mr Picton said.
He said it was important that medical professionals, and society as a whole, ""believe women, in terms of their symptoms"".

Ms Flynn Wallis said seeing the final report was an emotional experience.
""[It] is such a historic day,"" she said.
But she said she would not rest from her mission to make life better for other sufferers.
""I feel like I've been nagging people for a very long time,"" she joked.
""I'm probably just going to get even more annoying now to make sure these [recommendations] are implemented, so 'sorry, not sorry' in advance.""",ABC News,lifestyle
Low-maintenance hydro plants are perfect for beginner gardeners,By Amy Sheehan,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-16/how-to-grow-hydro-plants/105043060,"If you're a self-professed 'black thumb', growing lush, low-maintenance plants could be as simple as swapping soil for H2O.
Hydroponics is a method of growing plants that uses water instead of soil to deliver essential nutrients directly to the plant roots.
It works both indoors and outdoors and is a good option for small spaces.
And they can get by with very little attention, according to Queensland horticulturalist Cath Manuel.
""If I go away for a while, I'm going to come back, and all my plants still look good,"" Ms Manuel says.
""I think that works for a lot of people … very low maintenance, lush sort of plants.""
If this is ticking a few boxes for you, here's how to introduce hydro plants to your space.
You'll need a plant suitable for growing hydroponically or a cutting from one, a jar of choice, and a little bit of patience.
Ms Manuel, who lives on Kabi Kabi lands at Sunshine Beach, north of Brisbane, says ""most indoor plants that grow as ornamentals also grow really well in water"".
Choosing a jar to put them in is half the fun, as you can indulge your creativity and tastes.
But keep in mind that jars with a wide opening, as opposed to a narrow neck, will have water evaporate more quickly and will need to be topped up more regularly.
""I get big old jars, those coloured glass jars from recycling centres or antique stores"" Ms Manuel says.
""You just watch the roots grow in the water, but then the vine just keeps growing along a shelf or something like that, so they look lovely.""
Plant enthusiast Anna Augustine propagates and sells hydro plants on Letteremairrener country, at Launceston, Tasmania.
A cutting in water can take three to four weeks to grow roots.
""Start off with propagating small plants that you like the look of,"" Ms Augustine says.
""There's a few species that do really well from just cutting off the little nodes on their stems … and they will actually continue to grow in the water.""
The other option is converting a plant from soil to a jar of water.
""All you have to do is give the roots a really, really thorough rinse, and make sure you get as much of the dirt off as possible.""
""In the first couple of weeks, you will see a lot of the roots rotting away in the water.""
""Don't be scared about, 'I'm killing my plants', it just needs time to transition.""
Before you decide on a plant, it's worth considering how it grows naturally versus how you want it to look.

""If you want it to spread along a table, then go for something like a prayer plants (Maranta leuconeura) that will crawl across,"" Ms Augustine says.
""Your typical Swiss cheese plant or split-leaf philodendron, they will trail along either a piece of string or even along the wall if you use hooks.""
Ms Manuel says devil's ivy (golden pothos) is also popular because ""it's green, lush, and glossy"".
""A lot of cafes use it, and you'll see it trailing around on shelves and over bookcases,"" she says.
Plants that grow upright include bamboos, jade plants (Crassula ovata), Peace lilies (Spathiphyllum) and succulents.
""There's a peperomia, that's quite nice in water and that's sort of more upright,"" Ms Manuel says.
""I've taken some agave, where I've cut them off their main like mother plant, and they've got a few small roots, and I'll put those in a jar.""
Syngoniums are Cody Reed's favourite hydro plant to grow at home.
The 26-year-old tradie from Woodford/Jinibara land Qld, found a passion for hydro plants years ago after helping his mum sell nursey plants at a local market.
Queensland plant enthusiast Cody Reed says Syngoniums are his favourite hydro plant to grow at home. (Supplied: Cody Reed)
""I currently have 18 hydro plants in the house.""
""My favourite plant would definitely be the Syngonium, they're native to tropical rainforests in southern Mexico and they always adapt well in water.""
""I love gifting them to people I care about and I'm always looking for more to add at home.""
Most plants will do well in a room with lots of natural light (not direct sunlight), in just tap water, Cath Manuel says.
But some do prefer filtered water.
""I was getting brown tips on the end of my Peace lilies … due to watering it with tap water, because they don't like the chlorine,"" she says.
""I started watering mine with filtered water, and they don't get the brown tips on the end anymore.""
Most plants will need to have their water topped up anywhere from once a fortnight to once a month. (ABC Lifestyle: Amy Sheehan)
She says you can also add a few drops of a pH adjuster to help.
Keep an eye on the water levels for when they might need a 'top up', this can be anywhere from once a fortnight to once a month.
The water only needs to be changed completely if ""it becomes really dirty, or the plant was dying and the water was a little bit smelly.""
""Just be mindful of when you're topping up the water to not go too far up onto the stem of the plant,"" Anna Augustine says.
""Otherwise, the water could potentially rot the stems.""
If you think your plant needs a bit of a boost, try a few drops of liquid fertilizer, although it's not a necessity.
""It does make the water a bit cloudy, but it can give the plants just some extra nutrients,"" Ms Manuel says.
""But in saying that, I've got jars of plants that are just straight tap water, and they're growing beautifully.""",ABC News,lifestyle
We asked our readers how they lowered their insurance premiums. Here are their tips,By Widia Jalal,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-02-27/audience-responses-insurance-premiums-tips-and-tricks/104983110,"As weather events and climate change put upward pressure on home insurance premiums, annual increases have become a major impost on household budgets.
We asked our readers to share their success stories in lowering their premiums, and had experts weigh in with their advice on the best strategies.
Here's what our brains trust had to say.
Home owners can decide whether to insure solely their property or extend their cover to include the loss of household items and belongings in the event of a mishap.
Taking out home insurance covers only damage to the property, whereas combined home and contents insurance factors in the value of material things inside the home that are damaged or lost, alongside the cost to rebuild.
If you're considering taking out insurance for your belongings for the first time, or you're reviewing existing cover, here are some important things to keep in mind.
CHOICE insurance expert Jodi Bird says it's important to distinguish the rebuilding costs from the actual market value of your home.
He suggests using an independent online calculator to help estimate costs and then comparing those to what's available on insurance provider websites.
That is why some readers actively stay across current costs that are involved with rebuilding when reviewing their policy covers.
Another way to lower your cost is each year or every two years at least check out how much coverage you really need for your contents cover. If you've got coverage of $100,000 for contents and you lose it and your contents are only worth $50,000, you will only be paid the replacement value of $50,000. Many people also forget insurance companies do not insure the land. They're only insuring the building on the land and you need to consider the building materials. — Jon, Vic
With the house & contents policy most insurers automatically put it up each year based on increased building costs, clean-up costs & other fees etc. But you can do your own checking to get an estimate rebuild figure. Sometimes what they say is the cost is higher than needed. I got them to leave it at the previous year's premium & I'll consider it again if needed at the next renewal. — Ian, Qld
Some readers were able to lower their premium payments after deciding they could do without certain coverage, something Mr Bird emphasises should be done with caution.
I have received a quote of about $700 lower than my current insurer on house and contents. New insurance does not cover flood. My council's flood certificate states no risk of flooding so worth the risk. — Suzanne, Qld
Shopped around to lower my apartment contents insurance and found a cheaper company. I rang to cancel my insurance with my existing provider, and they did a check. They asked if I needed flood insurance, I said no, and the price dropped dramatically. — David, NSW
In these instances, Mr Bird says it's important to be fully informed about the flood risk in your area.
One way to check this is to toggle on the flood premium option on your insurance provider's website.
If it reduces your payment, Mr Bird says, ""That's the insurer's way of saying they think there is a risk of flood where you are and that's something worth checking out with the local council.""
Sometimes, all it takes is a conversation with your insurance provider.
(Pexels: Anna Shvetsa)
At least, that was the case for these readers.
I managed to lower the premium just by negotiating. This has happened twice and I'm wondering whether there's not a set amount that the customer service people are permitted to offer. — Adam, Vic
Our premium went up by a few thousand. I called the insurer, and after a short, pleasant conversation the premium was dropped to slightly above the previous year. — Peter, NSW
Even if that means being transparent about your financial means.
I have rung the insurance provider, told them it's too expensive and asked them to make a better offer. This usually results in a reduction of $150-$250. — Rebecca, Tas
Henri from Queensland took a more proactive approach and provided his insurer with quotes from competitors that resulted in a price match.
We received our renewal invoice and it was $7,500. After comparing with two other insurance companies (with the same levels of cover and similar excess) and getting a far better quote (some $2,250 cheaper), I rang our insurance company and complained to them about the price. My call was escalated to a more senior person and they offered to match the lowest competitive price. We agreed and ended up saving approximately $2,250 — a great result. However, I'm unsure if it will happen this December when our insurance comes up for renewal again.
It's also worth checking against your existing provider in doing a price match, says Mr Bird.
""Pretend to be a new customer and see if you actually get a cheaper deal that way,"" he says.
If they offer a lower price, don't be afraid to contact your insurer and request them to match the better offer.
Hot tip: Use an incognito browser when accessing their website so you won't be identified as an existing customer.
Heard of the loyalty tax?
The motto ""persistence pays"" has come true for Henri van Riet who shaved off more than $2,500 by refusing to take no for an answer.
It's when insurers attract as many new customers as possible by offering hefty discounts up-front, which are later replaced with inflated premiums.
Being loyal to an insurer doesn't come with rewards, Financial Counselling Australia chief executive Peter Gartlan says.
He urges people to move around or negotiate for better deals.
ACT resident Belinda shared her experience with switching providers after decades of being a loyal customer.
The decision came with pleasant surprises.
I had been a loyal and constant customer with the same insurer for almost 20 years. In 2024, I had finally had enough of the insurance premiums going up and up while the insured value dropped. So, I contacted the company to have them reduce the premium by a small percentage. I then shopped around and got various quotes from other companies — I was shocked to see the premiums for identical options hundreds of dollars lower with multiple companies — up to $500 lower in the case of our house insurance. I have now moved each policy across to the new insurer as they were renewed. The new company also offered no fee pay by the month while the previous company charged you more to pay by the month.
And while switching providers may seem daunting at first, comparison websites can make the process easier.
Ian from NSW traded an hour of his time spent on research for $500 worth of savings.
I reduced my house insurance from $ 1536.05 to $1028.10 simply by comparing most insurance companies. For spending an hour on the internet I saved $500 or a third of what I was being charged.
But if sifting through comparison websites prove unfruitful, it might be worth keeping your eyes and ears peeled for signs around you.
A colleague's recommendation saved Sam from Western Australia $5,000 on her insurance premium, which had initially doubled.
I bought a house last year. To insure it, I used the provider of my contents insurance. I found them through a insurance broker. This year, my insurance had doubled to around $9,000 for the year. Comparison sites weren't able to provide a cheaper alternative, neither was the insurance broker. I accepted that's the best I could do. Thankfully [I talked] to a colleague [and] they recommended their insurer. I got a quote for $4k and switched. Very thankful I had the conversation.
William from New South Wales had an offer fall right into his hands at about 50 per cent less than what he was already paying.
Found a link to [an] insurance in one of their handouts, checked it and it was about 50% less than the current cost. The increase from 2024 to the current renewal with the now dumped insurance company was about $2000. Also able to pay monthly.
A CHOICE report out today compared quotes across 35 insurers, finding the average home insurance premium has increased by 16 per cent over the past year.
However, it stressed insurance premiums fluctuate across different areas over the years.
Mr Bird says this shows insurers were always adjusting their perceived risk levels. He suggests double-checking with insurers when a renewal comes around even if their prices were high in the past.
Here are the insurers whose average prices have increased by the most between January 2024 and January 2025, according to CHOICE.
Here are the insurers whose average price increase have increased by the smallest amount between January 2024 and January 2025, according to CHOICE.
On average, Mr Bird says, ""For every $500 you increase your excess by, you reduce your actual premium by about 10 per cent"".
Jodi Bird urges people to compare prices not just among providers but also within the chosen insurer, on each premium renewal. (Supplied: Jodi Bird)
While increasing your excess can lower the premium amount, there are important factors to consider.
An excess is the fixed amount you would need to pay the insurer for when making a claim on your insurance policy.
Choosing a higher excess amount results in a lower premium rate.
So, it involves making a judgement between paying more up-front or having the excess amount ready down the road when an unexpected event happens.
This is what Simon from NSW had thoroughly considered in assessing what he was comfortable with losing, when making the decision to increase his excess amount.
He then scored $900 worth of savings on his insurance premium.
Dropping insurance quote… I simply increased my excess to the maximum ($5000) as I figured if my house burns down then $5,000 is well worth it to rebuild a house, and the likelihood of flood for me is minimal. Also, contents wise I don't own anything expensive really. Second-hand furniture is fine for me. My premium dropped from a quoted $2,500 to about $1,600. I'm not worried about slight damage, only the cost of a rebuild ie bushfire.
Others also shared similar experiences when they increased their excess.
[I] have in the past year doubled the size of their excess from $5,000 to $10,000. Taking up this feature saved me $400. — William from NSW
I negotiated a higher excess ($3,000 vs $1,000) to significantly reduce my premium. — Tom from Vic
If you struggle to manage or dispute costs on your own, you can engage either an insurance broker or approach an ombudsman via the Australian Financial Complaints Authority (AFCA) for some help in several areas, Mr Bird says.
An insurance broker provides advice tailored to your situation and can find out the best insurance options for you based on a thorough assessment of your needs.
Also acting as an advocate, they would also be able to undertake negotiations on your behalf.
Mr Bird says brokers can be very helpful in ""special circumstances"" such as if you are running a business from home or have a property larger than two hectares.
AFCA encourages you to take complaints to your insurer first and participate in their internal dispute processes before going to them for help.
It is important to note that AFCA will not consider complaints about premium increases unless it involves the following scenarios:
""Essentially, the insurer needs to be able to provide a valid reason for why they are increasing your premium by a certain amount,"" explains Mr Bird.
Here's how some readers have benefited from having third-party help.
I was shocked by the massive increase in my House and Contents insurance. I contacted my local Federal member of Parliament. He wrote to the CEO of this particular insurance company asking for a ""please explain!"" After the usual hoo-ha from the company, I did manage to get a 5 per cent discount off the premium … better than nothing I guess! — Bruce, NSW
My premium was up for renewal and I went online and completed an application. The premium jumped from $5,000 to $14,000 per year. I rang and said I had spoken to the Ombudsman and it was reduced to $6,000. — Lisa, QLD

Turning the right to disconnect from principle to practice in your working life,By Anna Chisholm,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-19/navigating-right-to-disconnect-from-work/105065122,"Most working Australians now have the ""right to disconnect"" under the Fair Work Act.
This means you would be within your rights not to answer a call from your boss about something non-urgent on your rostered day off.
But organisational psychology Professor Paula Brough warns ""it's not all black and white"".
The right to disconnect applies to all Australian businesses with more than 15 employees.
It will also apply to people who work for small businesses (those with fewer than 15 employees) from August this year.
According to the Fair Work Commission, the right to disconnect allows employees to refuse to monitor, read or respond to contact or attempted contact from their employer, or work-related contact from another person, unless the refusal is ""unreasonable"".
Paula Brough says there can be a ""little bit of a grey area"" when it comes to what employers and employees consider reasonable. (Supplied: Paula Brough)
Professor Brough, who is also the director of the Work, Organisation and Wellbeing Research Centre in the Business School at Griffith University in Brisbane/Meanjin, stresses the right to disconnect ""is not a blanket ban"" on being contacted outside of work hours.
""It's about excessive calls … that interfere really with a worker's rest.""
President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions Michele O'Neil says: ""It's important that we recognise that some jobs require people to be available, but typically those jobs recognise that and there's already clear rules and pay conditions that go with it.""
The right to disconnect is helping combat work ""creeping"" into evenings, weekends and holidays where it's not necessary.
Ms O'Neil says in the event of a work emergency, most people would be happy to be contacted to help deal with a crisis, and that would also be considered reasonable contact.
She says what's unreasonable is the ""more regular and systemic way"" that some managers request non-urgent tasks to be completed. For example, emailing on a Saturday asking for something to be completed by Monday morning.
In sectors such as hospitality, retail and health care, Ms O'Neil says this might look like finishing a shift and then being regularly contacted within just a few hours about the next shift ""when they haven't even had time to recover, let alone have a life outside of work"".
Gabrielle Golding says the right to disconnect is 'It's not a right to necessarily ignore everything from your boss'. (Supplied: Gabrielle Golding)
University of Adelaide senior law lecturer Gabrielle Golding says an employer contacting a worker about shift changes would usually be considered reasonable.
""If, on the other hand, they were requiring you to perform urgent work for the next day that meant you had to work over and above your normal working hours, or over your weekend, that would be considered an unreasonable infringement on your private time,"" Dr Golding says.
She says how an employer contacts an employee is also a factor when considering what is 'reasonable'.
""The Fair Work Commission would take into account — when assessing whether contact outside of one's normal working hours is in fact unreasonable — how much disruption is actually caused by the contact.""
For instance, a single email is probably far less disruptive to your time off than multiple calls.
Professor Brough says what's reasonable and unreasonable is a ""little bit of a grey area"".
""It requires each organisation to think about its own norms of what is reasonable contact,"" she says.
The Fair Work Ombudsman encourages employers and employees ""to discuss out of hours contact and set expectations that suit the workplace and the employee's role"".
The Ombudsman says it's beneficial to have these conversations before out of hours contact happens, where possible.
Dr Golding says if you're planning to have a conversation with your employer about unreasonable out-of-hours contact, ""identifying trends or patterns of behaviour or contact that might be potentially infringing on one's right to disconnect"" could help.
Professor Brough says ""you can pre-empt any contact by discussing it with your supervisor"".
For example, she says you could outline the times you've been contacted beyond ordinary hours in the last week or fortnight and explain that ""unless it's a complete emergency I won't be answering work requests this weekend"".
""If you're having excessive calls, you can say, 'I've already answered three calls over the weekend and I'm not going to respond to this until I'm back at work on Monday'.""
Ideally, Professor Brough says ""you should be able to have a frank conversation and at the time of contact to be able to say, 'this can wait until I'm next back at work'"".
Michele O'Neil says 'people are healthier, happier, we have a better society and people contribute better at work if they're able to recover from work'. (Peter Healy, ABC News.)
Dr Golding says the legislation requires disputes about an employee's right to disconnect be discussed — and ideally resolved — at the workplace level first.
""I would think that most reasonable employees and employers can find a meeting of the minds on that issue.""
Beyond that, an employee can go to the Fair Work Commission. The Commission can make a stop order ""if they feel there right to disconnect has been infringed on and already discussed within the workplace"".
The Commission can also deal with the dispute in other ways, such as holding a conference.
Professor Brough says If your workplace is large enough to have a human resources representative or department you can also consider asking them to be involved.
She says the changes to the Fair Work Act are still relatively new and human resources may help update your manager.",ABC News,lifestyle
Aquaphobia is more common than we think. But conquering it is possible,KBy Kate O'Halloran,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-17/aquaphobia-fear-of-water-australia-swimming-adults/105002492,"As sisters growing up in south-western Sydney, Diane and Lorraine remember sitting on their dad's shoulders as he waded deep into the ocean.
Mum — who couldn't swim — would watch on from the sand, minding one of their six siblings.
""A few times, the waves were huge, and we got dumped, which terrified me,"" Diane, now 71, says.
""Dad didn't do it on purpose, and it didn't even happen that many times, but it really scared me, and I still hate that feeling of my feet not being on the ground.""
Unable to afford swimming lessons, neither learned to swim, while their parents told them to stay out of the pool, and wouldn't let them participate in school carnivals.

Diane remembers her father as an ""anxious"" person, who had returned with PTSD from the Second World War.
""He had a lot of anxiety about safety… even walking to school by yourself,"" Diane says.
""I think Mum and Dad were fairly anxious about us going into the water … so it was not really a thing we did as a family.""
Both Diane and Lorraine, 74, took the initiative to learn to swim as adults, but neither was successful.
""I was never able to conquer that fear of not being able to touch the bottom of the pool or the ocean,"" Lorriane says.
""I don't even like putting my head under the water in the shower,"" Diane adds.
""I just get that feeling of drowning almost.""
While for Diane this means avoiding the water almost entirely, Lorraine lives for getting her feet wet.

""The ocean can give you a sense of freedom,"" Lorraine says.
""I sort of have this fantasy about it. It's so calming, and beautiful … and I love walking along the rocks.
""But I'd never swim in the ocean. I'd be too embarrassed. I worry that if I go out too far I'll get dumped and make a fool of myself.""
It's a story Jacqueline Wong knows too well.
Originally from Aotearoa/New Zealand, she lives in Melbourne and runs a business called The Swim Project dedicated to teaching adults to swim.
She says a fear of the water — otherwise known by the technical term ""aquaphobia"" — is the ""most common thread"" among her clients.
Swim teacher Jacqueline Wong says many of her adult students live with aquaphobia. (Supplied: The Swim Project)
""Aquaphobia has a significant and prolonged, maybe [even] lifelong impact on the way someone leads their life,"" Wong says.
""What that looks like is avoiding the water, or holidays around the water, and perhaps being triggered by certain noises, sensations [like the feeling of your feet not being able to touch the bottom of the pool] and smells [like chlorine].""
Wong says fear of the water is more prevalent than we realise, with several factors influencing how likely someone is to develop it.
The most common is experiencing a traumatic event (or events) related to water, while another is ""modelling"" received from family members, especially parents.
Fear of the water is often linked to a previous traumatic event or family ""modelling"".  (Getty Images: Alexi Rosenfeld)
""If a family member has had a severe traumatic event in the water, the chances that a child is scared of the water increases,"" she says.
""That's why it's even more urgent that adults find a space where they are comfortable to learn and gradually expose themselves to the water.""
Brendon Ward, CEO of SWIM (the national peak body for swim instructors and teachers), argues that alleviating fear of the water is critical in a country where drownings still occur regularly.
While Australia fares relatively well on a global scale, The World Health Organization estimates that there are approximately 300,000 annual drowning deaths worldwide.
Brendon Ward says alleviating aquaphobia is key to reducing the number of drownings in Australia. (Supplied: SWIM)
A significant portion of those are the result of ""accidental immersion"", referring to a situation where the person who drowned had no intention of entering the water.
And with more than 85 per cent of the Australian population living less than 50km from the coast, Ward says the case for improving adults' swimming skills is clear.
""A large number of Australians are at risk of drowning each and every day,"" he says.
Helping adults with aquaphobia, however, is not as simple as putting them in swimming lessons.
Wong has worked with a number of Australian adults like Diane and Lorraine who have tried unsuccessfully to learn to swim before coming to her.
""That tells me that the method isn't working, and the environment isn't right,"" Wong says.
Learning to swim as an adult is difficult, but it's far from impossible. Here's where to start.
Most adult swim programs, she explains, run half-hour classes, and in some cases, anxious beginners may be placed in groups of up to six people of varying abilities (including some who can already swim) while the teacher stays outside the pool.
There are also rarely lanes available for adults to practise basic skills, which means they must either spend time in the busy ""free"" area, often filled with small children, or in a dedicated ""slow"" lane with those swimming laps.
Wong says this can leave those who are aquaphobic feeling ""intimidated, unsupported and unsafe"".
""Automatically you're setting them up to fail, because they don't feel like they belong,"" she says.
""If someone has attempted to learn multiple times [without success], it just reinforces the idea that it's too hard or too late [to learn].
""That's when shame and embarrassment can set in, and it becomes a bit of a perpetuating cycle.""
Wong says the way in which adult swim classes are often run can cause aquaphobic students to feel ""intimidated, unsupported and unsafe"". (Supplied: The Swim Project)
Wong's approach to teaching adults with a fear of the water starts with meeting them where they're at.
""I listen to learn, and try not to make any assumptions,"" she says.
This means ""not rushing"" clients into anything that makes them uncomfortable, like putting their head beneath the water, or ""getting them horizontal"".
Instead, Wong will start by introducing ""fun"" activities like doing ""star jumps"" in the water, or other exercises that ""decrease the fear factor"".
""It's about building a healthy relationship with the water, self-trust, confidence and connections with other adults who are also on this journey,"" she says.
She also keeps classes small, and is ""realistic"" with her clients about how long it may take to change their relationship with water.
Wong says one of the keys to successful adult swimming lessons is ""not rushing"" the students. (Supplied: SWIM)
""It takes up to a year of consistent learning and practice to build the muscle memory required to overcome fear and build mental resilience,"" she says.
""Once they get there, the opportunities to engage in other water activities like surfing and snorkelling are endless.""
She says the best part of helping adults with a fear of the water is the impact it can have on other areas of their lives.
Former clients, for example, have later contacted Wong to say they have taken their children to the beach or pool to learn to swim.
""I don't take that for granted, because it's a really big decision to learn to swim as an adult,"" she says.
""The joy for me is seeing someone choose courage, not only in the pool, but in other areas of life.""",ABC News,lifestyle
First homebuyers who got into the market without the bank of mum and dad,Alexandria Utting,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-02-23/how-first-homebuyers-are-getting-into-the-market-in-queensland/104959064,"The importance of having a place to call home is patterned from an early age.
As children, we build forts out of sheets draped over furniture, while dollhouses line the shelves of almost every department store toy aisle.
For millions of young people, the reality of property ownership is a far cry from the future they pictured playing house in their childhood bedrooms.
As prices skyrocket at a faster rate than wages are growing, and cashed-up investors swoop on entry-level properties, first-time buyers are being pushed aside.
As a result, many Gen Z and Millennials are now convinced that what has long been considered the great Australian dream, will always be out of reach.
But against the odds, these five young Queenslanders have bought their first homes.
And before you ask, they didn't live with their parents rent-free while saving the deposit or dip into the bank of mum and dad.
Daniel King and Jasmine Lim's home on Russell Island has water views. (ABC News: Alexandria Utting)
First homebuyers Jasmine Lim, 32, and Daniel King, 29, say they've got it all.
And with baby Sarah and a three-bedroom home on a big block with water views, it's hard to disagree with them.
The catch?
They live on Russell Island in Queensland's Moreton Bay, home to about 3,600 people, about an hour's ferry ride from Brisbane.
""We like living here because it's a relaxing family sort of place and it was affordable for us,"" Mr King says.
The pair chose Russell Island for its services, which include a supermarket, primary school and public pool.
The island has boomed in popularity in recent years due to its affordability and laid-back lifestyle.
""I mean, who doesn't like to live on an island?"" Ms Lim says.
Mr King and Ms Lim say the commute to the city is a compromise that paid off. (ABC News: Alexandria Utting)
After being priced out of growth corridors like Ipswich west of Brisbane, the pair paid $390,000 for their house on an 800sqm block.
""Considering we just had our first daughter, we wanted to not over-leverage ourselves and still be able to afford to live on one income,"" Mr King says.
But saving the deposit without help from family wasn't easy.
According to the Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute (AHURI), those who have help with their deposit from the bank of mum and dad or other relatives are twice as likely to enter the property market.
AHURI managing director Michael Fotheringham says contributions can range from thousands to millions of dollars.

""I think it's much more widespread than most people realise,"" Dr Fotheringham says.
""The problem is that we end up with a system where if your parents own a home you're likely to own a home and if your parents are renters you've got very little chance of owning a home.""
It took this Russell Island couple three years to save their deposit, with Mr King working at a building materials supplier at night and Ms Lim doing her accounting job in the day.
""We sacrificed a lot, quality time, mostly,"" Mr King says.
""I would get home, and Jas would be leaving. We'd see 10 minutes of each other but we knew it wasn't going to be forever.""
They also cut overseas travel and eating out.

""We made a needs and a wants list … but sometimes things crossed over and you're like, 'I need that takeaway tonight' and you have to live a little,"" Mr King says.
The pair was eligible for first homebuyers subsidies but had to save a 20 per cent deposit due to many lenders' risk criteria for properties on the island.
""We got rejected by the first bank and that was heartbreaking but then we tried another bank, and they were more than happy to accommodate us.
""Don't be defeated by the first, 'No,'"" Mr King says.
He says despite the early mornings and the commute, he gets to work quicker than his colleagues who travel from the Gold Coast.
""I've got my little group that I sit with on the ferry in the morning; we all start at the same time, we'll have a coffee and have a laugh.""
The pair says the great Australian dream is still possible.
""It's really empowering to say, 'I did that,'"" Mr King says.

When buying on the Sunshine Coast, Tegan Maskell, 35, and Elias Harris, 33, knew they would need space for only the two of them and their dog Otto.
""We have decided to be child-free and that actually made buying a house much easier,"" Ms Maskell says.
After being priced out of larger homes by investors, the registered nurse and fitter and turner settled on the one-bedroom home with a study in Nambour for $475,000.

The hinterland town is one of the Sunshine Coast's oldest suburbs and is the gateway to popular tourist hotspots like Mapleton and Montville.

As well the smaller house, living further from the Sunshine Coast's beaches was a compromise they had to make.
What they wouldn't forgo was a garden and a big shed for hobbies, which now features a rock-climbing wall.
In 2024, financial platform Canstar found first homebuyers are saving half of what they did two years ago.
According to the data, a single person saved $724 per month toward the purchase of their first property in 2024, down from $1,417 in 2022.
This was echoed by CoreLogic head of research Eliza Owen, who says it could take a first homebuyer almost 11 years to save a 20 per cent deposit based on the median house price in regional Queensland of $700,000.
""Even if you're saving at a consistent rate, your savings are likely not enough to keep up with the market,"" she says.
Eliza Owen says regional centres are becoming more popular. (ABC News: John Gunn)
Ms Maskell and Mr Harris say they've always been diligent savers and were still able to put money aside for their deposit despite increases in the cost of living.
""You can enjoy being frugal and find it satisfying,"" Ms Maskell says.
""Be realistic about your budget and what you can live with, regardless of interest rate rises.""
This Longreach property cost $150,000 but it needs a bit of work.  (ABC News: Hannah Walsh)
At 24, Tom Cameron has already bought two houses, and sold one.
Last year the stock agent moved back to his hometown of Longreach in outback Queensland for its lifestyle and affordability.
Mr Cameron spent $150,000 on a property there. He admits the house needs work but says he's up to the task.
This isn't his first house; Mr Cameron bought another property in Dalby in Queensland's Western Downs a few years earlier, which he sold last year.
Renovations have started inside Tom Cameron's outback Queensland property. (ABC News: Hannah Walsh)
""[Longreach] is a great town and there are plenty of great towns around,"" Mr Cameron says.
""I guess if you want to live in Paddington in Brisbane and buy a house for $1.2 million well, it probably is a little bit hard for a young person to get a go.
""But in a lot of these rural communities and smaller towns, it is quite affordable.""
The mortgage repayments are about $275 a week, making it an affordable asset.
Mr Cameron says working hard after school and taking no overseas trips helped him buy property young. (ABC News: Hannah Walsh)
Buying the properties meant Mr Cameron didn't travel after high school like his peers.
""My first overseas trip was this year to New Zealand,"" he says.
""Before that … I didn't go away, worked a lot … but I don't know if you'd call them sacrifices, I still enjoyed it.""

Brendan Sutton credits the central Queensland mining boom with helping him buy his first house in Rockhampton.
The 25-year-old completed an electrical apprenticeship at Blackwater coal mine, about two hours west of the beef capital.
""I was lucky enough to have a pretty good paying job straight out of school, which definitely helped me in buying this home,"" he says.
He bought the two-bedroom, one-bathroom Queenslander just after his 23rd birthday in 2022.
Many of his friends also bought in Rockhampton because they could save a deposit and have a social life.
""I still went down south for music festivals, I went away for footy events, all that sort of stuff,"" he says.

According to the latest data, prices in Rockhampton have grown by more than 20 per cent in the past year — but the median house price is still under $550,000.
According to CoreLogic, ""spill over regions"" in less populated areas around the state are seeing the largest growth.
""They're not the big regional centres like the Sunshine Coast or Gold Coast, but areas like Mackay or Townsville … they don't have as high of a price point, and that's attracting a lot of buyers,"" Ms Owen says.

Brisbane primary school teacher Hannah Smoothey, 35, lost out almost 50 times before she scored her unit in Coorparoo.
""It was really depressing,"" Ms Smoothey recalls.
""There'd be at least 20 people, probably around 50 at some inspections, and it was really tricky because you could tell that there were lots of property investors … and you were going to have to compete with people with a lot more money than what I have.""
To get together her deposit, Ms Smoothey dipped into her superannuation, a risk she thinks paid off.

""It wasn't a significant amount out of my superannuation because I've been working since I graduated from university.

Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia (ASFA) chief executive officer Mary Delahunty says it's ""completely understandable"" that first homebuyers would want to withdraw from their super because there are ""no other options"".
""My message to young people is, expect better from your politicians than asking you to pay for a problem you didn't create,"" she says.
""We need to go back to the drawing board … and stop asking people to choose between retirement or a house because that's just grossly unfair.""

Ms Smoothey bought her property in 2022 and says she struggles to enjoy the achievement because of how hard it has become for her friends to do the same.

Egg shortages are predicted to continue. Here are some substitutes,KBy Kellie Scott,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-18/egg-substitutes-and-making-those-you-have-last-longer/105017042,"No doubt you've noticed a lack of eggs on supermarket shelves.
Shoppers across Australia are being warned egg shortages could continue for at least three years due to increased consumer demand and ongoing avian influenza outbreaks.
Aside from stalking your local shop, there are things you can do to keep things moving in your kitchen.
Egg farmers and market analysts warn increased consumer demand and ongoing avian influenza issues are to blame for current egg shortages.
Kyla Smith is a paediatric dietitian in Perth/Boorloo familiar with using egg substitutes.
""Lots of the parents I work with have kids with an egg allergy,"" Dr Smith says.
And while there are obviously some meals you can't recreate without eggs — like scrambled eggs and quiche — she says there are alternatives for things like cakes, biscuits, rissoles and sauces.
When thinking about substituting eggs, Dr Smith says you need to consider what you are using it for.
Are you trying to bind ingredients, create a ""fluffy"" texture, thicken, or glaze?
For binding, Dr Smith recommends mixing 1 tablespoon of chia seeds mixed with 3 tablespoons of hot water to equal one egg.
For baking, she suggests 1.5 tablespoon of oil mixed with 1.5 tablespoon of water and 1 teaspoon of baking powder.
Dr Kyla says cornstarch is an effective alternative thickening agent, and milk works for glazing.
Wagga Wagga/Wiradyuri Country-based patisserie owner Kylie Haran uses half a cup of mashed banana instead of egg when creating things like chocolate cake.

Storing your eggs correctly is key to making them last.
Fresh eggs can be kept refrigerated for up to six weeks, according to Australian Eggs, a not-for-profit for egg farmers.
It's important to follow the use-by date on the carton, however.
Following the news some supermarkets are limiting how many eggs you can buy, you might be wondering how you can make the ones you have last.
If you do not store your eggs in the fridge, you will need to use them much sooner than the date on the carton, Victoria's Department of Health warns. Refrigeration minimises the growth of the harmful salmonella bacteria.
Emma Morgan runs Fat Hen Hobby Farm in Wamuran, near Caboolture in south-east Queensland, and says whether you're collecting eggs from your own backyard or the supermarket, you should refrigerate as soon as possible.
She recommends leaving eggs in their carton, as eggs are porous and can soak up fridge smells.
Australian Eggs warns temperature fluctuation can cause eggs to go bad and become a health risk.
It says a cold egg left out at room temperature can sweat, facilitating the growth of bacteria that could contaminate the egg.
Refrigerated eggs should not be left out for more than 2 hours before cooking, according to Australian Eggs.
It says you can test if an egg has gone bad without cracking it by placing it in a glass of water.
If the egg sinks to the bottom and lies flat on one side, it's good and fresh to eat.

A weed-filled courtyard becomes an urban meadow in Beci Orpin's garden revamp,Close to 500k Australians could have missed out on savings at the pharmacy,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-09/beci-orpin-studio-garden-tour-melbourne-with-jimmy-sing/104964336,"It's not an easy feat turning a weedy rental garden into a thriving field of flowers.
A few years ago, artist and illustrator Beci Orpin enlisted her friend, garden designer Jimmy Sing, to revamp the neglected courtyard of her studio.
The 12-by-12-metre walled space in Melbourne, on Wurundjeri Woi Wurrung Country, is now a plant-packed source of inspiration and a welcome respite from city life.
Here's how it came together, including some of the plants they used.
Most of the ground is covered with flowering plants, their take on an urban meadow. (ABC News: Madz Rehorek)
""We both talked about how we love the wild spaces of the city, like paths along trains lines and edges of car parks ... where [plants and flowers] let loose,"" says Jimmy.
""We wanted to do that in a way that was a bit more tended, more intentional about layering lots of different colours and flower shapes … teetering on the edge of being a wild garden.""
The courtyard also needed to be functional, with space to sit and socialise. Year-round views from inside the studio were important, too.
The garden is filled with grasses, trees and flowers and is designed to entice people outside. (ABC News: Madz Rehorek)
""It's not very formal, which suits the space. It's always evolving, we essentially let the plants redefine the space,"" says Beci.
Dense planting creates an immersive environment, and the huge diversity of species and layers means there are endless beautiful details in the shapes, colours, scents, and textures.
There is always something new to discover as the garden evolves. (ABC News: Madz Rehorek)
This keeps things interesting, but Jimmy says it's a constant editing process.
""We're definitely not trying to keep it static but that means some things are always disappearing, or self-seeding.""
He keeps an eye out for ""thuggish"" plants, which can push out others. Without monthly maintenance, the space would start losing its diversity.
Making-over a garden filled with weeds can be daunting, but Jimmy says there were benefits. ""They provided cover to the soil, so the soil was actually quite nice. There was a lot of annual weeds that would have put organic matter back in over the years.""
The studio garden has no hard edges, creating a softer feel and gentle flow through the space. (ABC News: Madz Rehorek)
As part of the revamp, the weeds were pulled out before a fresh layer of soil was added, plus gravel for the paths, which organically smothered what was left.
Then they planted heaps of reliable ornamental plants that grew quickly and left little room for weeds. Now it's just the edges of garden beds that need a few weeds pulled out by hand!
Investing in the garden has made the space more inspiring and enjoyable. (ABC News: Madz Rehorek)
Beci decided she would rather see this space filled to its plant potential for a short time rather than doing nothing. Beci communicated the plans to the landlord before any work began, and they were happy to have their garden cared for.
But it is a lot of effort for a temporary space.
""This has a life span for us, but what can we do while we're here? There's something nice about it being temporary,"" Beci says.
""I think investing in a temporary space, it's still important. We've got time to enjoy it.""
A range of flowers at different heights are featured in this Melbourne garden. (ABC News: Madz Rehorek)
Growing so many different plants can get expensive. Jimmy suggests relying on indigenous plants in a tube stock size to fill out the space as much as possible.
They can cost as little as a few dollars each, so you can save more of your money for larger, feature plants.
""They are so much more affordable, and those plants have been really resilient here.""
The space is practical too, with room for outdoor seating. (ABC News: Madz Rehorek)
A big bonus of this plant-forward garden style is creating habitat for wildlife. There's plenty of nectar, seeds, and hidden nooks for shelter.
""[There are] so many insects here, it's been the summer of the ladybugs. There's dragonflies, hoverflies, bees, butterflies,"" says Beci.
Jimmy says wildlife are attracted by the sheer variety of plant types and there is something for everyone. Another tip is to ""always have something in flower, that sees them right through winter"".

"Bob Trevino Likes It is the remarkable story of a mistaken Facebook friend request, and the healing it gave",By Stephen A Russell,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-19/bob-trevino-like-it-debut-film-tracie-laymon-interview/105062950,"When filmmaker Tracie Laymon was growing up in Houston, Texas, she used to perch in her bedroom closet, writing. ""I called it my office,"" she chuckles.
A queer person, Laymon jokes, ""I eventually came out of that closet.""
That creative space, and a finely honed sense of humour, were the best ways to process her father's often angry, unpredictable behaviour, and tendency to disappear for long periods.
""My mum and I, we'd be going through so much awful stuff, and we would just laugh at the absurdity of how bad it was,"" Laymon says.
""When I tried to talk to him about things that were important to me, it was not a welcoming space.""
Laymon tried to connect to him through their mutual love of cinema.
""I thought if I wrote a movie about the things that mattered to me, then maybe he'd see it and we could talk,"" she recalls.
""That drove me for a long time, until I realised that's not the healthiest of motivations.""
""There are moments where Barbie [Ferreira, pictured] goes through three or four emotions in a couple of seconds,"" Laymon says. (Supplied: Roadside Attractions)
Eventually, they became estranged. But after a long time of no contact, Laymon sent him a friend request on Facebook.
He accepted.
Only, it wasn't her father. It was another man with the same name.
""It was kind of a shock at first because, in the moment where I thought it was him, he had access to my heart,"" Laymon says. ""That felt good. I needed that, so I decided to stay friends with him.""
While the perils of connecting with strangers online are well known, the other Bob became the source of paternal positivity in Laymon's life she had always yearned for.
""I got a little bullied when I shaved my head during the pandemic,"" she recalls as we sit in a cosy corner of a quiet Melbourne wine bar. ""And then I got a comment from Bob Laymon saying, 'I think it looks great.'
""[The movie] really impacted me and it brought up a lot of stuff that I've put deep down,"" Ferreira told Pop Culture Planet. (Supplied: Roadside Attractions)
""I got a happy birthday from him every single year when my dad never said it.
""I was in a beautiful state of shock.""
This remarkably wholesome bond is fictionalised in Bob Trevino Likes It, Laymon's adorably bittersweet debut feature.
Euphoria star Barbie Ferreira stands in for the filmmaker. ""I did imagine myself when I was writing it, but when it came time to cast the lead, I was looking for someone with vulnerability, a sense of humour, kindness and a hopeful, determined optimism,"" Laymon says.
""I thought if I wrote a movie about the things that mattered to me, then maybe [my dad] would see it and we could talk,"" Laymon says.  (Getty Images: Amanda Edwards)
Ferreira fit the bill. Renamed Lily Trevino, we first meet her as she's just found out via an errant text message that her boyfriend's cheating. Later, in a therapy session, Lily says, ""Despite what my father says, I'm pretty sure it was not all my fault.""
John Leguizamo (Romeo + Juliet) plays Lily's newly acquired Facebook dad, with French Stewart (3rd Rock from the Sun) as her irascible biological father.
Lily goes on an emotional rollercoaster. You can see a cascade of feels flicker across her face.
""There are moments where Barbie goes through three or four emotions in a couple of seconds,"" Laymon says. ""It's an acting masterclass.""
Laymon says it wasn't too weird, directing someone playing a version of herself. ""We built trust together and really made it a safe space,"" she says. ""I always had her back, and she always had mine. The truth was in the collaboration.""
""I've had a lot of moments of loneliness ... so it was easy to tap into that and then just make him [Bob Trevino] like a regular guy,"" John Leguizamo (pictured) told The Mary Sue. (Supplied: Roadside Attractions)
The film won both the Grand Jury and the Audience Award at the 2024 SXSW film festival in Austin, Texas. It's where Laymon went to film school, interning for director Richard Linklater of the Before trilogy fame, shooting award-winning music videos to get by.
""I didn't have a lot of money and was struggling, but I figured that I could get bands to pay if I could convince them they wanted to do a narrative video,"" Laymon recalls. ""My biological dad never came to any of my screenings.""
Now based in Los Angeles, Laymon's family moved from Houston to Moscow when she was 14. It was the mid-90s and it was a culture shock.
""I found myself freezing, walking to Red Square and watching the changing of the guard while reading Catcher in the Rye,"" Laymon recalls.
She attended an international school. ""My friends were from Nepal, Germany and Namibia, and those different points of view have really impacted my storytelling,"" she says. ""I learned to appreciate belonging in a new space, because I realised over time that when I was a child, I didn't really feel like I belonged.""
""It was such a small cast and crew, we were all really invested in this film,"" Ferreira told Film Independent. (Supplied: Roadside Attractions)
This yearning informs Bob Trevino Likes It. As does a horrific car accident after Laymon returned to America at 17, necessitating a painful, prolonged recovery.
Lauren 'Lolo' Spencer — The Sex Lives of College Girls star and proud disability advocate — plays Lily's best mate and live-in care client Daphne.
""Because I had a physical disability as a teenager, it was very important to me that character be authentically cast.""
Laymon's father died in November 2022. She's processing that in new writing.
""We did have a peaceful end, thankfully, but I think without this healing period of my life where I learned healthy boundaries, I couldn't have had that,"" Laymon says.
""He didn't get to see the film, but it's strange. In a weird way, I feel like he's with me at the screenings.""
And she'll never forget the kindness of the other Bob.
""He had no idea of the power of his words. It was just so beautiful, and now I try to be kind to everybody because it takes two seconds to reach out to someone who might really need it.""",ABC News,lifestyle

Australia 'behind the game' when it comes to helping families navigate child loss,By Amelia Walters,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-06/grief-and-unexpected-financial-costs-of-losing-a-child/104942580,"Mason Helgeson was a bright and bubbly boy who would light up any room he walked into.
Readers are advised this article contains content relating to pregnancy loss, neonatal loss, and child loss which some readers may find distressing.
His mum Bronwyn described him as an energetic five-year-old who loved to kick the footy with his dad and dance in the kitchen to Uptown Funk, and was kind to all his classmates.
""As a parent, the best thing you could want for your kid is that they're going to grow up and be a kind human being, and he was just that,"" Ms Helgeson said.
But on August 29, 2021, Mason died suddenly from an undetected twisted bowel, also known as intestinal volvulus.
Mason was so excited to become a big brother to Oliver. (ABC Riverland: Amelia Walters)
Ms Helgeson, who was 10 weeks postpartum at the time with her second son Oliver, said losing Mason was something she had never considered a possibility.
""It's unfathomable; the last thing you expect as a parent is for your child to pass away. No parent should outlive their child,"" she said.
""To have someone that is such an integral part of your life just suddenly be gone, it destroys you and it destroys all aspects of your life.
""As much as we wanted to put ourselves away in a hole and not do anything, we had to keep living … because we still had this baby that was relying on us.""
Ms Helgeson says having memorial jewellery helps keep Mason's memory alive. (ABC Riverland: Amelia Walters)
Ms Helgeson's home town of Clare in South Australia's Mid-North region rallied around the family, raising more than $40,000 to help cover the costs of Mason's funeral and cremation.
She said she was grateful for the warmth from her local community, as the emotional and financial burden of losing a child was not something many people considered until it happened to them.
Ms Helgeson says the financial cost of losing a child impacts on the grieving process. (ABC Riverland: Amelia Walters)
""The way the financial cost of living is at the moment, not everyone has that sort of money to [have a funeral], to take time off work to grieve and to honour their loved one,"" she said.
""It is a bit of a vicious cycle.""
While there are ways to access financial support to help navigate child loss in Australia, they are means tested, requiring a person's income and assets to be considered before being granted support.
Grief Australia chief executive officer Christopher Hall said the country was ""behind the game"" when it came to helping families navigate life after child loss.
""We know that it costs about $6,000 to bury a child, and that's a significant expense,"" he said.
Christopher Hall says while death ends a life, it doesn't end a relationship. (ABC News: Billy Draper)
""I know in the UK, Scotland and Europe … funds have been established that cover the entire costs for families for the burial of a child that aren't means tested.
Ultimately, Mr Hall said grief was still highly stigmatised in Australia.
He said our current understanding of grief was comparable to sex education ""in the 1960s"".

South Australia Labor MP Olivia Savvas, who is spearheading an inquiry into stillbirths in South Australia, said most of the submissions expressed struggling with the unexpected costs of losing a child.
""Most people aren't going into the hospital knowing that they will lose their baby at all, let alone that they will have the costs associated with burying them.
Olivia Savvas is spearheading an inquiry into stillbirths in South Australia. (ABC News)
A regional council in South Australia's Riverland region has recently chosen to waive grave digging fees for stillborn babies and children under 10.
Berri Barmera Mayor Ella Winnall said the fee was a ""small impact to the council's budget"" and the council was more than happy to waive it to help those suffering through child loss.
Grave digging fees were previously $282.50 for stillborn babies and $342.50 for children, which were comparable to other local councils, Ms Winnall added.
Ella Winnall says waiving grave digging costs is an easy way to help reduce trauma. (ABC News: Guido Salazar)
Ms Savvas said councils across the state should follow in Berri Barmera's footsteps.
""There is a lot to be said for a council who proactively makes the decision to waive those fees … it's not necessarily about the financial cost, it's about the message that it sends to a family,"" she said.
Bronwyn Helgeson wants to see Australia become a place where harder conversations about child loss are normalised.
""I think it's what a lot of people in the bereaved community want … having those open conversations definitely would help release a bit of that taboo,"" she said.
Mason's memorial is where his friends and family can sit and reflect on their time with him. (ABC Riverland: Amelia Walters)
Ms Helgeson said grief was never a one-size-fits-all process, and it presented differently for every person going through it.
""I know when my two other sons [Oliver, three years old, and Bodhi, 18 months old] surpass Mason's age, that's probably where my grief is going to hit me more because it will be a time that we didn't get to have with Mason,"" Ms Helgeson said.
""I know that that's going to be like a wrecking ball … and it reminds you that the experience was taken away from us, and from Mason.""

Converted Queensland church for sale as former religious sites given new life,By Lily Nothling,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-02-28/converted-church-for-sale-as-old-places-of-worship-become-homes/104842372,"A unique and painstakingly restored Presbyterian church is on the market in Far North Queensland, as old places of worship are given new life as homes and businesses.

It features a steep pitched roof, stained glass windows and a Queenslander out the back.

Mr Winborn-Sharp said tens of thousands of people viewed the church online but finding a serious buyer had been a challenge.
The building was originally listed for $725,000 but that recently dropped to $560,000, a fraction of the median house price in a capital city.
""Over the years, unfortunately, [the church] was left to rack and ruin,"" Mr Winborn-Sharp said.
""The current owner purchased the property about four years ago and has spent a huge amount of time and personal effort in restoring the church, clearing tonnes of gardens and almost rebuilding the manse at the back.

They have since converted the church into an architecture practice and the back hall into a sophisticated Airbnb, popular among brides getting ready before their wedding day.

Consumers urged to learn olive oil variety flavours as tasting room pops up in Coonawarra,By Elsie Adamo,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-15/olive-oil-tasting-rooms-help-teach-australian-consumers/105035872,"Can you describe the taste of the olive oil you purchase?
Australia is producing more olive oil than ever, and growers want Australian consumers to become more knowledgeable about the product.
While olive oil is often considered a household staple, most Australians are not well-versed in key taste profiles, according to those within the industry.
So what do you look for in a good olive oil?

Royal Adelaide Show Olive Awards head judge Trudie Michels said the approach was similar to wine tasting.
""The best gold medal oils have a lovely fresh and complex aroma, and also on the palate.""
According to Ms Michels, general knowledge of olive oil has slowly improved, but most Australian consumers are not regularly trying different options.
Similar to wine, olive oil palate preferences are highly individual.
Those with a developed palate can taste the differences in olive oil between seasons, much like wine vintages. (ABC Rural: Megan Hughes)
Ms Michels said limiting yourself to one type of olive oil was like only drinking one variety of wine.
""Taste it, try it, and see what you think because they are all so different.""
The good news for Aussie consumers was that, according to Ms Michels, Australian olive oil was only getting better.
""There's been a general increase in the number of silver and gold medals compared to 10 years ago,"" she said.
Some producers are taking it upon themselves to help educate the public.

Confido Coonawarra recently started an olive oil tasting room — a first in their region in South Australia's South East.
Consumers are encouraged to visit the olive grove to learn how olive oil is made and how to properly taste the product.
The tasting room was prompted by conversations owner Heidi Boyd was having with consumers who wanted to learn more about olive oil.
""A lot of people don't know a great deal, but they want to learn more,"" she said.

Attendees sip a series of different olive oils, both international and Australian, to help them understand the differences in tastes and textures.
Visitors also have access to a flavour cheat sheet to help put a name to flavours, such as pepper, grass, fruit, and herbs.
Ms Boyd said that much like not everyone liked the same wine, not everyone would enjoy the same type of olive oil.
Olive oil tasting experiences are not common, but Australian Olive Association chief executive Michael Southan said they should be encouraged.
Is extra-virgin olive oil really extra-virgin? Australia relaunches an olive oil monitoring program.
Other strategies are also being used to help fix the knowledge gap about olive oil, starting with chefs.
""There has been a lot of work done by producers training chefs around the flavour profiles of different oils,"" Mr Southan said.

Pressure mounts for NSW Health to improve abortion access statewide,JBy Joanna Woodburn,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-17/pressure-on-nsw-health-to-improve-abortion-access/105032522,"New South Wales Health is refusing to detail what work it is doing to improve access to abortion services at public hospitals across the state.
The department is reviewing its policies governing termination of pregnancy, after its own report on the state's current abortion laws specifically recommended that ways to balance the rights of conscientiously objecting health practitioners with a woman's entitlement to receive timely care be examined.
But it is not clear, and NSW Health has declined to comment on, how the availability of these services across the state is being addressed.
Greens MLC Amanda Cohn said more action by the department was required.
Amanda Cohn says the issue should be treated with more urgency. (ABC Sydney: Andrew Whitington)
""In the five years since abortion was decriminalised in New South Wales we haven't seen sufficient action from New South Wales Health to actually make sure that services are provided,"" she said.
Access to abortion services was thrust into the spotlight in late 2024 when certain restrictions were temporarily in place at Orange and Queanbeyan hospitals.
The suspension of terminations with no identified pregnancy complications at Orange was attributed to a ""misinterpretation"" of local guidelines, and internal correspondence seen by the ABC stated that the hospital was adhering to state policy.

A statutory review of the Abortion Law Reform Act 2019 was completed by the Ministry of Health last September and tabled in parliament in November.
Its terms of reference were to consider whether the legislation was operating successfully, with particular consideration given to who can perform abortions, counselling requirements and conscientious objections.
But access to terminations was ""outside the scope of the review"".
""The ministry will consider this content in relation to access and pathways to abortion care,"" the report said.
Health Minister Ryan Park recently said an ""urgent review"" of NSW Health policy was starting in March. (ABC News)
The ABC asked NSW Health what was being done to address access concerns.
The department declined to comment and instead referred to a previous media statement which confirmed a policy review was being done.
Dr Cohn has introduced an amendment to the NSW legislation, and one of its key pillars is ensuring abortion services are available at public hospitals, or within a reasonable distance for people to access.
She said she was disappointed with the time it was taking the government and NSW Health to take action.
""Business as usual has gotten us into this terrible mess where people have been turned away from public hospitals for services that hospital has the technical capability to provide.""That doesn't meet at all with community expectations that most public hospitals would provide abortion care.
""I don't have confidence in a business as usual approach from the ministry of health.""
NSW Health Minister Ryan Park declined to be interviewed by the ABC.
At a budget estimates hearing on February 27, Mr Park was questioned about what he was doing to ensure services were being provided consistently.
""There are immediate initiatives to boost consumer information and awareness … that includes financial assistance to address access barriers, particularly barriers for priority groups,"" Mr Park told the hearing.",ABC News,lifestyle
Choosing an emergency contact when you don't have close family or friends,KBy Kellie Scott,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-18/who-to-put-down-if-you-dont-have-an-emergency-contact/104972916,"When nominating an emergency contact, a partner or family member might seem an obvious choice.
But for many, there isn't someone that immediately comes to mind.
""There are a lot of circumstances that can put someone in a position where they don't feel they have a close connection to anyone,"" says Luke Martin, a clinical psychologist at Beyond Blue.
""You might have moved away from family, old networks and friends, [or] maybe had a conflict in the family and are estranged.""
It's also a task that can make people feel uncomfortable and even distressed, Dr Martin says.
""It can be a confronting moment,"" he adds.
The experts we spoke to say not having an obvious emergency contact is a common scenario, and thankfully, there are usually alternatives that just require a little bit of brainstorming.
Running a local men's group has brought Hayden Esparon a lot of job satisfaction. It's also helped him through some difficult times.
Whether it's at the doctor's office, your child's school or starting a new job, there are many scenarios in which we are asked who to contact in an emergency.
It's a routine question that can carry weight for some, says Tim Senior, a GP working in Indigenous health and a medical adviser to the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP).
Dr Senior says many people in Australia have family overseas or interstate as well as life experiences that have isolated them.
""There are plenty of people who have (a) disability or mental health problems or other issues … where they just feel quite isolated and not part of the community that they're in.""
Dr Martin says the loneliness epidemic means more people find themselves in this situation.
One in three Australians say they often feel lonely and one in four say they are persistently lonely, he says.
""In the past 50 years, there have been so many social forces that have put us in a position where more people are living by themselves,"" he says, adding that WFH, longer work hours and fewer places ""in the community where we gather"" are exacerbating factors.
Dr Senior says there may also be people who are in relationships with people they don't trust, such as when domestic and family violence is present.
""They might be under pressure to put a partner down [as a contact], but that they're uncertain about what would happen if they were contacted.""
There are many contexts in which we can nominate an emergency contact, some more serious than others.
Dr Senior says you need to consider what responsibility that contact will have and what information they may have access to.
If you aren't sure, you can ask the organisation or person asking you to complete the form.
If the nominated contact needs to make medical or financial decisions on your behalf, they should be someone you trust who knows your values, explains Dr Senior.
People often feel honoured to be asked if they would be an emergency contact, Dr Senior says. (Pexels)
In those instances, proximity and availability might not be relevant. However, to collect a sick child from school for example, it will be.
An emergency contact should be easily reachable and aware they are your nominated person.
Trevor Omara, from Queensland, is a volunteer with Telecross, a telephone check-in service from the Australian Red Cross.
Each day, people registered with the program receive a phone call from volunteers like Trevor.
""It's also a chance for genuine human connection while checking in on their emotional and physical wellbeing,"" he says.
Trevor says there are many clients who fit the demographic of people who don't have an obvious choice for an emergency contact, and recommends people ""think outside the box"".
""[It could be] someone from a local cafe or places that they attend regularly,"" he says.
Loneliness is now a public health priority for the World Health Organisation, and with one-third of Australians feeling lonely some or all of the time, there are growing calls for the federal government to do the same.
Dr Senior says a first step can be to look around you. For example, is there a neighbour that might be willing to help? Other parents at your child's school? A colleague you get along with?
""Consider social and community clubs. Maybe someone from a sports club, or if you attend religious services through churches or mosques or temples, asking someone there.""
It can be useful to challenge the assumption that you have no-one to list as an emergency contact, suggests Dr Martin.
Support workers and health professionals are also options to consider.
""Being vulnerable"" with the person asking you to complete the form can help brainstorm ideas, Dr Martin says.
""Let them know about your situation and ask for their ideas and workarounds. You're not the only person who would have asked them that.""
While it can feel like a burdensome request, Dr Senior says ""people are often only too happy to help"".
And making the request can be a chance to deepen that relationship.
""It's not a neutral question. It can be an opportunity to develop new friendships or social circles.
""It's a question that promotes going out for a cup of coffee together.""",ABC News,lifestyle

I was seen as lazy growing up. Being diagnosed with ADHD in my 20s explained a lot,Close to 500k Australians could have missed out on savings at the pharmacy,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-19/being-diagnosed-with-adhd-as-a-woman-of-colour/105007642,"Everyday tasks like showering were challenging for Cathrine Mupangure growing up.
""Brushing my teeth, having routine, cleaning my room — these things were so difficult for me, but my friends could do it so easily,"" the 25-year-old social worker from Canberra/land of the Ngunnawal people says.
Cultural expectations meant navigating ""paralysis"" when it came to taking care of herself, and completing other tasks like handing in school assignments, made things even tougher.
""As a woman of colour, in your culture, you have to be accommodating.
""There's no room to fail with very specific expectations as there is a household that is depending on you.""
Cathrine says if you didn't ""fit the mould"", you were considered ""lazy, careless and unwell.""
These challenges persisted during her teenage years and into adulthood. Until at 22, a ADHD diagnosis explained everything.
We spoke to Cathrine about living with ADHD when you don't know you have it, and how growing up in an African household shaped her journey.
These are her words.
Cathrine never suspected she had ADHD until her adult years. (Supplied)
Looking back, I had ADHD symptoms in childhood. It would present as inattentiveness.
It affected my schooling like handing in assignments, contributed to impulsive decisions, and almost just paralysis when it came to things I had to do, especially taking care of myself.
Staying on top of things that I wasn't interested in, I could not do for the life of me.
From the outside, it was perceived as laziness.
I also did a lot of stimming; chewing my tongue, squeezing my fingers a certain way.
I was very fidgety.
My background is Zimbabwe, my parents are from there, and it's expected that you will work twice as hard as your white counterpart to survive.
You have to succeed. That is what they were taught growing up, and that's what they taught us.
When people of colour see that you are different, like I was, it's hard for them to understand.
There's a lot of pressure to do things like complete university.
And at home, you have to cook and clean. There were people in my life who felt I wouldn't be able to find a husband because of the way I lived.
Even growing up as a neurotypical woman of colour in a white country, there is not a lot of wiggle room to be different.
Having a disability makes that 10 times harder.
Cathrine felt a lot of pressure to succeed in life, such as complete university. (Supplied)
In adulthood I became pretty depressed, and didn't really understand what was happening, or who I was.
My last romantic relationship was a bit of an excuse to move out of home. I wasn't really dealing with myself, and he was a good escape for me.
But my depression — due to my ADHD — was affecting the relationship. I wasn't cleaning, I wasn't taking care of myself. I couldn't shower or go to work.
There were other issues too, and eventually we broke up.
I had friendship breakdowns because I was not consistent in seeing people, catching up, checking in on people.
In any of my relationships, I just didn't have enough in my cup to pour into myself, let alone those around me.
I was listening to a podcast, and the host was explaining some of the similar challenges I had, like handing in assignments and feeling moments of paralysis.
I was like, I didn't know this is what ADHD means. I always thought it was about hyperactivity, rather than inattentiveness, which I experienced.
I did some research and went to my GP, who initially tried to tell me it was just my iron levels.
Then that I was ""just depressed"" — gaslighting me a bit.
I changed doctors and was able to connect with a psychiatrist who gave me the diagnosis. That took a year from when I made the appointment.
Getting diagnosed was a major validation. It provided an explanation for why I was the way I was.
Especially with the cultural context of my family.
You just can't explain it to people when you don't have the language.
Once I had a diagnosis, I could access supports and put strategies in place to help me.
Especially being able to access people of colour and women who have ADHD who have shared their experiences, it's made me feel like I'm not alone.
The diagnosis removed a lot of shame that I held internally.
Today, I attribute a lot of my favourite qualities about myself to my ADHD.
I'm adaptable, flexible. I'm more authentic.
And although parts of my culture made growing up with ADHD feel harder at times, I love my culture and I love embracing its traditions.
My lived experience with ADHD has helped me with my social work, too. Especially with clients who are neurodivergent.
As a woman of colour, we have a lot of expectations put onto us of how women should act and how they should be. Which can make it even harder to reflect, and help ourselves by accessing services.
Hopefully women like me can help open the doors and create conversations and spaces to show the world that we do exist.
And it's OK to exist.",ABC News,lifestyle
Accessed your super early? Experts on if you should pay it back,Ask a question,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-11/boosting-superannuation-funds-early-access/105008944,"If you were one of the millions of Aussies who dipped into their superannuation during the COVID-19 pandemic, you may be wondering when or how to replenish your retirement pot.
Data from the Australian Taxation Office shows it approved the early release of superannuation for 3.05 million people in 2020, totalling $37.8 billion, as Australians flocked to take up the government's emergency support measure allowing them to withdraw up to $20,000.
So do you need to pay back your superannuation? And when is a good time to start?
People financially impacted by COVID-19 were able to apply to the government to access their superannuation between April 20, 2020 and December 31, 2020.
The COVID-19 early release of super program did not require people to pay back the withdrawal amount.
According to the ATO, eligibility for early access included a reduction in working hours, unemployment, or being made redundant.
But a survey by the Australian Institute of Family Studies shows some reported using the funds for things like home renovations, debt repayments or purchasing a motor vehicle.
Financial literacy advocate and accountant, Ketvi Roopnarain says allowing access to super via 'self-testing' meant people who may not necessarily had experienced emergencies, suddenly had access to their funds.
Ketvi Roopnarain says the three largest cohorts of applicants to the early release scheme were in their 30s, 40s and 20s. (Supplied: Serena Betti)
""And [some] withdrew the maximum without necessarily understanding the long-term implications to their retirement nest egg.
""The three largest cohorts of applicants were: [those] in their 30s (33 per cent), followed by 25 per cent in their 40s and 22 per cent in their 20s.""
Let's say you withdrew the maximum $20,000 in April 2020, Ms Roopnarain says this is how it could impact your super long-term:
Matt Grudnoff says the hardest working dollar in your super account was the first dollar you put in.
""That $1 basically has interest or, investment returns on it for the longest period.
""So if you take money out, particularly early on, then that's going to have the largest impact.""
The senior economist says putting money back into super, particularly if your balance is small because you've drawn it down could be ""very beneficial"".
And the sooner you can help your retirement pot grow, the more time it will have to recover, says Ms Roopnarain.
Small improvements in your superannuation's performance or fees can make a significant difference in retirement.
""Even small additional contributions have the potential to boost your retirement savings, thanks to the 15 per cent tax rate on super contributions versus a marginal tax rate of at least 30 per cent if you earn above $45k, potential investment earnings, and compounding growth over the long term.
""They say the best time to plant a mango tree was 20 years ago, the next best time, is today.""
If you withdrew money from your super fund through the COVID-19 early release of super program, you can opt to rebuild your super by making personal super contributions until June 30, 2030.
Through the federal government's COVID-19 re-contributions scheme, these contributions are excluded from the non-concessional contributions cap (the maximum amount of after-tax contributions you can make to your super each year without it being subject to extra tax).
One thing to be aware of is that you can't claim a tax deduction for putting this money back in.
You'll need to fill in the ATO's COVID-19 re-contribution form and provide it to your super fund before or at the time you make your contribution.
""You can put back what you took out, but not more [within the re-contribution scheme], "" Ms Roopnarain says.
She says if you started this month, for example, you could contribute small amounts over 63 months, until June 2030 to top up your superannuation.
""Have a play with the Moneysmart superannuation calculator to determine what you might be able to contribute and how it might increase your end balance,"" she says.
""While the early release scheme provided emergency short-term relief during the pandemic, it's essential to view your superannuation as a long-term investment for your future financial security.""
She also recommends getting in touch with your super fund to discuss re-contribution options.
Mr Grudnoff recommends that as well as getting general information, like this article, people seek their own financial advice.
""Financial advice from a professional is an important thing in this kind of situation.
""Seek that out … specifically for your circumstances.""
While the pandemic scheme is closed, you can still apply for early release of superannuation for a variety of reasons.
These include compassionate grounds, medical reasons, temporary or permanent incapacity, as well as severe financial hardship.
The maximum amount that can be withdrawn for financial hardship is $10,000.
But our experts say you will need to prove those circumstances to your superannuation fund.
""There's hardship provisions, basically if you have lost your job, if you are going through some other kind of deep financial hardship you can apply and then you're assessed,"" Mr Grudnoff says.
""If you're assessed to be in financial hardship you can withdraw some of your super out in order to use it to get through that.
""The difference during the pandemic was you just had to say 'I want to withdraw my super' and you could do it.""

Prime minister rules out a royal commission into the childcare sector,Australia's childcare rating system labelled 'a joke',https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-18/prime-minister-rules-out-royal-commission-into-childcare-sector/105068078,"Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has dismissed the call for a royal commission into Australia's childcare sector, saying there needs to be an investigation and action taken if standards are not met.
A Four Corners investigation has exposed a flawed, inconsistent regulatory system and an increasingly profit-driven industry that has resulted in some centres cutting corners, hiring unqualified staff and eroding the overall quality of care.
""Last night's revelations on Four Corners are of course of deep concern. There needs to be certainly an investigation and action taken wherever the standards are not met,"" Mr Albanese said.
He said state governments, who were responsible for regulations, would be looking at the report.
""We love our kids, and kids deserve proper care and attention and respect, and that is what everyone should try to deliver,"" he said.
With centres reassessed on average every four years, and some gaming the system, parents cannot be sure their child's centre meets the standards or that staff are properly trained or qualified.
But Mr Albanese dismissed the call from the Greens to hold a royal commission.
""People call for royal commissions whenever anything comes out immediately.
""They take years, they cost a lot of money. You do not need a royal commission to show that what was shown on TV last night was wrong,"" he said.
Emily's* son was abused at his childcare centre, and she says cost should not be a factor.
""You can't be putting a price tag on children that can't speak up for themselves,"" she told the ABC.
""Money's got nothing to do with it.
Jane*, another mother whose child has been let down by the system, agrees.
""We need policy and change makers and politicians to get on board, stop arguing, and actually try to help our children.""
Greens early childhood education spokesperson Steph Hodgins-May had called for a royal commission, saying the federal government could not ignore the ""alarm bells"" and it was time for the sector to have a ""serious overhaul"".
Here is some practical advice to help you feel confident in your childcare provider — and what to do if something does not seem right.
""The reports we know about are likely just the tip of the iceberg. A royal commission into privatised early childhood education would bring to light the extent of the problem, and help pave the way for reform,"" she said.
""The current system is riddled with problems after years of neglect and marketisation of policy — it is too expensive, inaccessible and, at times, even harmful.""
Nationals senator Bridget McKenzie described the report as ""very disturbing"".
""We would be encouraging urgent action in this space because there's a lot of trust with parents as they put their children into childcare centres,"" she told ABC's Radio National Breakfast.
""And we think rogue operators and rip-off merchants shouldn't be allowed to operate with our most precious asset, which is our children.""
National Children's Commissioner Anne Hollands says there's no ""accountability for evidence based action.""  (ABC News: Billy Cooper)
National Children's Commissioner Anne Hollonds says governments must make enforcing standards a priority.
""National cabinet is where the prime minister works with the heads of all the states and territory governments and we work on issues of national significance,"" she said.
""Currently, children are not mentioned on that list.
""There's really no accountability mechanism right at the top of our federation to make sure that there's accountability for evidence-based action.""

Treasurer Jim Chalmers said the report was ""incredibly distressing"" and ""deeply concerning"".
""We work closely with state and territory governments. They're responsible for the approval of providers and services and to make sure that those services comply with the National Quality Framework,"" he said.
""And so we'll keep working with them to make sure that our kids are safe in early childhood education.
""It's such an important part of our community, and we want to make sure that it's up to scratch.

Young people are uploading videos to TikTok to show what they would look like fat. Here's why it can be harmful,Caitlin Rawling,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-21/tiktok-trending-ai-fat-filter-why-it-can-be-harmful/105075950,"Young people are uploading videos of themselves illustrating what they would look like if they were bigger than they actually are.
Experts are warning using this filter can cause harm and contribute negatively to those who struggle with eating disorders.
People are uploading photos of themselves on TikTok using an AI filter to see what they would look like if they were fat.
Multiple videos have been posted to the social media site with captions like: ""oh no"" or ""if this doesn't motivate me to go to the gym I don't know what will.""
A spokesperson from TikTok Australia told ABC News ""the AI filter is not available through our app, but they were uploaded to TikTok after being created on another video editing app [CapCut].""
Butterfly's head of prevention Danni Rowlands told ABC News, one of the biggest challenges in society was that ""we have strong body ideals, health ideals and appearance ideals""
She said the trend was reaffirming these ideals.
""The biggest challenge is that it's really making people think poorly of people in large bodies and it's making fun of people in large bodies.
""Regardless of what body size someone is, it is really damaging to a person's self esteem and body image, when jokes are being made about appearance, weight, shape or size,"" Ms Rowlands said.

Clinical psychologist Dr Simon Wilksch works with people experiencing eating disorders and agreed, saying the AI filter was ""offensive and disturbing"".
""My work involves helping people to develop self-worth in non-appearance-based areas,"" he said.
He said the filter not only draws attention to a person's appearance but also ridicules someone of a larger size.
""I could see it causing deep distress to many people,"" he told ABC News.
Dr Wilksch also added that young people in late primary school and early high school are at an age where acceptance by peers was ""exceptionally important to them""
Simon Wilksch is a clinical psychologist who specialises in working with people experiencing eating disorders. (Supplied)
""Thus, they can feel compelled to participate in trends like the AI chubby filter in order to fit in, even though it might be upsetting to them. Even worse, it's not hard to imagine some people using photos of others and putting them through the filter and posting them online.
""This could lead to enormous distress to the victim of such behaviour,"" Dr Wilksch said.
When asked if there was a way to prevent people from seeing these sorts of filters on their feed, Dr Wilksch discussed the legislation that federal parliament passed in November to ban people under 16 years old from having an account on some social media platforms and how ""that could mean younger people are more protected from this type of content.""
The ban won't take effect until December this year.
Dr Wilsksch has created the Media Smart Schools program for people in grades 6-8 and an online program called Media Smart, targeted for 13- to 25-year-olds.
""It's critical that young people have access to programs like these that have been found to reduce risk of eating disorders, harms of social media content and other mental health risk factors"".
Ms Rowlands said another way to prevent the fat filter from flooding your feed was to search up random content that doesn't have anything to do with someone's appearance.
Legislation to ban under-16s from social media will be put before parliament next week, but some platforms could be exempt from the proposed changes.
""It could be something around flowers, gardens or puppies. Whatever it is that will just mix up the algorithm.""
She said she knows it is easier said than done but sometimes putting your phone down can also help.
""Try to put it down. If you have to be on your phone, maybe play a really random game or something that's got nothing to do with appearance and that isn't flooding your mind with appearance-based content,"" she said.
When ABC News asked TikTok what it was doing to prevent this filter from trending, a spokesperson from the app said: ""Videos posted to TikTok using effects like this are not eligible to be recommended on the For You feed, limiting their exposure.
""Our strict community guidelines mean we will remove videos or comments that could be considered bullying or harassment, and we do not allow content that depicts, promotes, normalises, or glorifies eating disorders.
""If someone searches for this type of content on TikTok, they are redirected to support services,"" the spokesperson said.
Ms Rowlands said social media was a ""significant contributor into how people feel about their bodies"".
""The reality is that eating disorders have existed well before social media has. Unfortunately, the prevalence is increasing and the biggest thing it is doing at the moment is reinforcing that how we look is so important,"" she said.
The Cost of Appearance Ideals report published in February by the ButterFly Foundation, reported that over 4.1 million Australians had dissatisfaction with their bodies.
For generations words like fat, obese and overweight have been thrown around like hand grenades. In medical settings, the damage dealt can last generations. And the victims are overwhelmingly female.
When asked roughly how many Australians have an eating disorder, she said it was hard to get an exact number.
""We know that there are over 1.1 million Australians experiencing an eating disorder in Australia"" Ms Rowlands said.
""We also know that due to the nature of eating disorders that they are often undiagnosed and under-reported.""
Fat activist Demi Lynch is the founder of Kaleidoscope News and has spoken up against the trend on her social media platforms.
""I feel like it reinforces the notion that being fat is a bad thing and it's something we should be ashamed of; it's something that we should fear,"" she told ABC News
""I just hate that it was made into this idea that being fat is such a joke and what's sad is that the people that were creating these filtered versions of themselves, millions of people around the world have bodies that actually look like those filtered versions of themselves.""
After uploading her response video to the trend of the AI fat filter on TikTok, she said she received a lot of fatphobic comments.

""Most of the time I have to handle it and laugh at the absurdity of it all because sadly as a fat content creator, I have to get used to the backlash because just existing as a fat person means you're going to get trolled.""
She said this was sadly the experience for many fat content creators.
Content creator and podcast host Daphne Berry also spoke up against the trend and said she was ""blown away it was allowed to be on the internet at all"".
""I've had strikes on TikTok for saying the most minimal things and those videos being taken down yet something that is so toxic and harmful to so many not just women but impressionable young women in particular is my main concern for that,"" Ms Berry told ABC News.
When asked why she decided to call it out, she said it was ""a no-brainer"".
Daphne Berry is a content creator and podcast host. (ABC: Supplied.)
""I didn't even give it a second thought. it was just something that I had thought I should call out because I just don't see how that's allowed to be on the Internet.
""I really don't understand how TikTok allowed it and I don't understand how Capcut could even make such a harmful template in the first place.""
She added the video she stitched had many comments from other women asking her to take it down and saying it was harmful.
""If you got thousands and thousands of people in the comments telling you that it's wrong maybe you should take a little look and even if you don't understand it do a little bit of research behind it and listen to the people who are saying that it's hurting them.""",ABC News,lifestyle
"Australians on track to eat less fruit and veg, more junk food by 2030",Tegan Osborne,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-19/less-fruit-vegetables-more-discretionary-food-by-2030-study/105061998,"A new study has found in five years' time Australians are likely to be eating more junk food and less fruit and vegetables.
Right now we are eating about four serves of ""discretionary foods"" high in salt, fat, and sugar daily, and CSIRO research has found that was likely to increase 18 per cent by 2030.
This could cause a whole lot of health problems, hurting individuals and the taxpayers' purse.
So what is standing in the way of better eating in Australia? And how can we tackle the issue?
To find out what the average Aussie is eating today BTN High took to the streets to investigate what young people's diets look like.
Tom and Judd both admitted to eating quite a bit of takeaway food. (BTN High: Michelle Wakim)
Probably not the best. I get quite a bit of take-out food … and then I sometimes eat healthy a couple days of the week. — Tom, 17
I do get a lot of take-out, but mum makes some cooked meals throughout the week. — Judd, 17
I eat anything but I wouldn't say it's a good diet, at all. — Elsie, 19
It's okay. I'm pescetarian so I don't eat meat and I do a lot of my own cooking. Love pasta … try to get my veggies in. — Chester, 19
I would say my diet varies a bit. I try to eat pretty healthy most of the time but there'll be days where I'll have dessert and stuff. — Leelu, 18
Nutrition scientist Gilly Hendrie studies what people eat and how they can be supported to eat better, and co-authored the CSIRO study.
""The National Preventive Health Strategy gives us really clear targets around a healthy diet and what we're striving for. So for this research we wanted to see how we were tracking against those targets,"" she said.
The strategy's goals for 2030 include:

But Dr Hendrie said the CSIRO's study, which examined nine years' worth of CSIRO Healthy Diet Score surveys and used modelling to make predictions, found instead of moving towards these goals we were actually going backwards.
""We used data from over 270,000 Australians. We looked at the trends. And then we projected forward out to 2030 and found a concerning decline in our diet quality,"" she said.
By 2030 fruit intake is predicted to decrease by 9.7 per cent and discretionary food intake is likely to increase by 18.3 per cent, while vegetable intake is forecast to remain stable but well short of national targets.
Dr Hendrie said striving to eat a balanced diet was one way to help make change at an individual level.
But out on the street most of the teens we spoke with did not know how many serves of fruit and vegetables are recommended each day.
Elsie, Maisie, and Chester's guesses about daily fruit and veg serves weren't too far off. (BTN High: Michelle Wakim)
I remember you need five fruits. — Elsie, 19
No, I don’t think I know. — Maisie, 18
I don't know, five veg, something like that? — Chester, 19
Two serves of fruit and seven serves of vegetable? — Kendra, 18
I should know this, but, um, no. — Harriet, 18
The Australian Dietary Guidelines recommend we eat two serves of fruit a day and five serves of vegetables.
""A serve of fruit is easy, it's usually a piece, so a banana or an apple,"" Dr Hendrie said.
""[A serve of] vegetables is a cup of salad vegetables … or half a cup of cooked vegetables, or a medium potato.""
One cup of salad counts as a serve of vegetables, Dr Hendrie says. (Unsplash: Nielsen Ramon)
Dr Hendrie said on average we were eating ""about half of what we should"".
She said a cheap and easy way to boost fruit and vegetable intake was to incorporate canned and frozen products.
""If canned veg, frozen veg, makes it easier use it. Get it on your plate — amazing,"" she said.
But boosting your fresh food intake and cutting back on treats is not always a simple task.
Dr Hendrie said a range of factors influenced our diets like cost of living, education, culture around cooking, and where you live — which all needed to be addressed to reach our 2030 health targets.
Discretionary foods include junk food that is often highly processed and high in saturated fat, salt, and sugar.
""Things like takeaway, soft drink, but also things like processed meats, cakes and biscuits, pies, chips, lollies, chocolate, ice cream,"" Dr Hendrie said.
The Northern Territory's largest Indigenous community of Maningrida is finding its own solutions to limit food inflation.
The CSIRO study concluded that without ""significant intervention"" meeting Australia's preventive health dietary targets would be difficult.
And not achieving them could have a big impact for individuals and society.
""We know that too much of those nutrients [in junk food] places us at risk of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, high cholesterol, high blood pressure,"" Dr Hendri said.
""Chronic conditions place an enormous pressure on our health system. Rates of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease are increasing, and once we get to that point of needing treatment, whether it's medication or hospitalisation, it costs [taxpayers] a lot of money.""
She said Australia needed to find ways to make fresh produce more available and more affordable for everyone.
""In rural and remote areas it's more difficult to get fresh produce consistently throughout the year, and then at the community level how can we make it normal to eat [healthy food]?"" she said.
""[We need] healthy lunch boxes, healthy snacks at sports venues on the weekend, and also in our own homes.""
State and federal governments have implemented numerous healthy eating policies and awareness campaigns in the past such as a ""traffic light"" system in school canteens, and other countries have too.
However, the CSIRO study found when it came to research trials, community programs, and government initiatives to increase fruit and vegetable intake, large and lasting changes had rarely been achieved.
The introduction of a sugar tax — raising the price of sweet foods in stores — has been proposed in Australia, and there is evidence from overseas that this approach can lead to reduction in consumption.
Out on the street, young people had their own ideas for change too.
Leelu and Kendra both had ideas about how to help Australians eat more healthy food. (BTN High: Michelle Wakim)
Probably parents teaching their kids too. Start their life with a more healthy diet and healthy lifestyles. — Leelu, 18
I think having more healthy options available everywhere, in schools, at uni. There's a Maccas, Hungry Jacks, or KFC everywhere. But if you had easy, quick, cheap [and healthy] options like that all around you that would probably help as well. — Kendra, 18
People getting comfortable and building routines with cooking and having an education system that sets that up that for us. Things taste best when you make them yourself as well. — Chester, 19",ABC News,lifestyle
All-female hiking group takes off in Queensland as women seek friends away from pub scene,By Lily Nothling,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-20/female-only-hiking-group-empowering-women-in-north-qld/104842426,"Fed up with pub life being the main way for women in regional towns to socialise, Denika Wyngaarden laced up her boots and did something about it.
The 23-year-old north Queenslander founded an all-female hiking group and, since its inaugural trek last year, she has been overwhelmed by its popularity.
""It just got to a point where I was like, 'There has to be better ways to interact with people than [in pubs]',"" Ms Wyngaarden said.
The hiking group promotes female empowerment. (Instagram: BWH)
Ditching the pub and club scene led to a ""dramatic improvement"" in her mental health and motivation.
""I thought, if it's going to do that for me, it's going to do that for other girls as well,"" she said.
As a self-proclaimed ""bitch who hikes"", Ms Wyngaarden didn't look far for inspiration when naming her group — they're known as Bitches Who Hike.
The Townsville-based group started with a handful of members but has exploded in popularity, with 90 women showing up to a recent hike.

Ms Wyngaarden said the group's members ranged in age from 18 to their mid-60s and encompassed all fitness levels.
The group goes on hikes around north Queensland. (Instagram: BWH)
Bushwalking and hiking boomed during the pandemic and the popularity has continued.
Data from the Australian Sports Commission shows an estimated two million Australian women laced up their hiking shoes between July 2023 and June 2024.
Young people are leading the charge with the strongest participation rate in the 25 to 34 age group.
Hiking is becoming more popular among young women. (ABC North Qld: Lily Nothling)
Some of the group's members, like Shani Scott, have never had the confidence to go hiking until now.
""I felt much safer because there were people around and heaps of girls, so I knew I would be all right,"" Ms Scott said.
""I'll definitely come again.""

""I'm in my mid-30s so it has been hard, especially moving to a new place and not knowing anyone,"" she said.

While Ms Wyngaarden has been amazed by the group's growth, she is not surprised by the positive feedback after every hike.

Experts on how tidy your rental property's garden needs to be at the end of a lease,By Amy Sheehan,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-20/rental-gardens-end-of-lease/105062694,"Every week, Melbourne/Naarm-based handyman Brent Aitken tidies up about half a dozen rental gardens and lawns as tenants prepare to vacate.
He's been doing this sort of work for two decades and says he often gets calls from tenants or property managers to attend to specific things.
""They don't want to see a weed in the garden beds, in pathways,"" he says.
""Generally, on a house block, they want to see the lawns edged and mowed, all the pruning up to date.""
Mr Aitken says people are spending hundreds of dollars on professionals to tidy rental gardens, worried they're not going to get their bond back.

So how tidy does your garden or courtyard need to be when you hand the keys back?
It's a question tenants' unions around Australia would get asked most days, according to principal solicitor Ben Bartl from the Tenants' Union of Tasmania/Lutruwita.
""A tenant does not have to live in a property that looks like some sort of display home,"" he says.
""It's definitely not the case that the lawn, the garden, the courtyard needs to be perfect with everything immaculate, that standard is too high.""
Mr Bartl says the law in Australian jurisdictions is that properties should be returned in ""a reasonable state of cleanliness"".
That is the condition that an average person would be able to achieve, not the standard of a professional cleaner or a professional gardener, he says.
""At the end of the tenancy, you need to return the property, including the garden or backyard or courtyard, in a similar condition to how the garden courtyard or backyard was when you moved in.""
He recommends tenants take photos and videos of the garden and courtyard when they move into a property so when the time comes to vacate, they can see what condition it was in.
""For a lot of renters who are in properties for years, it's often hard to remember the condition of the garden or courtyard when you moved in.""
""By having evidence of the condition of the garden or courtyard … it makes it a lot easier for you to argue that the bond should be returned to you at the end of the tenancy.""
He says another piece of evidence that's useful is the real estate entry or condition report, which will often have notes as well as photos.
Real Estate Institute of Australia (REIA) president Leanne Pilkington says tenants are under no legal obligation to hire professional gardeners during, or at the end of a lease.
""Some tenants choose to but it's really up to the tenants,"" she says.
If you're not used to looking after a garden and a lawn, Ms Pilkington says it can be a little bit more work than you realise.
""My husband's in the garden every weekend, whether it's mowing, or raking leaves.""
Rental tenancy legislation varies in different states and territories, so check the specific laws in your jurisdiction.
Mr Bartl says the general rule is a tenant is responsible for weeding and lawn mowing, but a landlord is responsible for pruning large trees and shrubs.
Professionals on how to clean outdoor areas, from balconies to courtyards.
""If you do have overgrown shrubs, trees or hedges, talk to your landlord, because they need to organise to have them trimmed back.""
When it comes to cleaning a courtyard, he says tenants should also look back at photos or the real estate entry report.
""If there's moss, for example, on the paving stones and there wasn't when the tenant moved in, then yes, it's arguable that the tenant does need to ensure that they remove the moss either through a pressure hose or some other means.
""So again, that's why it's really important to have some evidence of the condition of the property when you moved in.""
If you need something more heavy duty than a garden hose, hardware stores have pressure-washing machines available for hire for anywhere between $40 for four hours, or $70 for 24 hours.
When it comes to mowing, Mr Aitken says people can expect to pay about $80 for a small house block.
""A regular mow should include whipper-snipping, mowing and maybe weed control,"" he says.
He recommends people get a few quotes before hiring a contractor.
Mr Bartl says agencies and landlords also need to consider seasonal changes and wear and tear.
""In the same way that carpets are going to get a bit thinner during the 12 months you live in a property … with the garden, you need to take into account reasonable wear and tear.
""Say, the length of a tree, a shrub or a plant's life, and in some cases, it may well mean that those plants die.
""If the tenant is able to establish that they are regularly watering the garden, that can just be a statement to say, 'once or twice a week, I was watering the garden'.""
Ms Pilkington says in some circumstances, seasonal impacts and water restrictions may need to be factored in.
""Obviously if it's winter and the tenant's moving out, but they moved in in spring, we're going to realise that the shrubs and the trees are going to look very different.""
Ben Bartl is the principal solicitor at the Tenants' Union of Tasmania. (ABC News: John Gunn)
Mr Bartl says a tenant will sometimes be able to say, ""it was a particularly hot summer, and so more plants have died because of the heat"".
""Similarly, if the soil is not of a good standard, that might be another reason why the garden has died away.""
""In both of those examples, it's not the tenant that needs to return the property in the same condition.
""It was because there were factors outside the tenant's control as to why the garden has deteriorated.""
He says if you and the landlord, lessors or agents cannot agree on a matter you may need to lodge a dispute application with your local tenant's tribunal or residential tenancy commissioner.

Virtual reality program helps foster carers understand confronting situations through the eyes of children,By Stephanie Richards,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-18/virtual-reality-training-program-for-foster-carers/105061912,"Warning: This story contains content that may cause distress for some readers.
Next to the empty beer cans and baby's rattle is a small splatter of vomit.
It stains the musty rug in the windowless, rubbish-strewn lounge room.

His eyes are rimmed with bluey-black bruises. A gold chain dangles from his neck.
A panicked woman is in the room: ""She's just sick. She can't help it"".
But the man does not seem to care.
""Stupid f****** child of yours,"" he shouts, staring directly down the barrel of the camera.
""You going to clean that mess up?""
For foster carer Louise*, the acted scene — played through a virtual reality (VR) headset — is a startling reminder.
The Adelaide-based carer is using the technology alongside a social worker to understand how her 10-year-old foster son might have lived before he entered her care.
""You're lying there on the floor as a baby, you're crying and nothing happens, or someone comes charging through a door and their face is right in your face and they're swearing,"" Louise says, describing one of the scenes she has explored through virtual reality.
""There's another [scene] where you're hungry and the mum is sitting there with some food … but she's obviously drunk or drugged or something.
The VR program is run in most states and territories by children's services agency Key Assets, using a system created by UK-based company, Cornerstone VR.

As part of the program, carers explore scenes dealing with domestic, family and sexual violence, emotional abuse, substance use and online grooming, using head and eye movements to view the situations through the eyes of a child.
Key Assets South Australia director Michael Ainsworth says VR can help foster carers understand why children in their care may experience isolation, school avoidance, sensory overload and trust issues.
""When you understand the story behind these children and young people's lives — some of the horrific things that they've seen — it gives you a greater understanding of the world that they're living in,"" he says.
""Right from in utero, many of these children and young people have been let down by the world, they've been let down by their parents.
""That has significant impact on the brain.""
The virtual reality headsets can help carers approach activities with children with a better understanding. (ABC News: Che Chorley)
Louise has been using the technology for about two years, and says it has changed the way she approaches activities with her foster son.
""When I'm going shopping with him, I'm able to see ... the noise, the people doing things, people shouting,"" she says.
""I now understand why he's drawn to certain things in the shop.
""Now that I've experienced it, I know I shouldn't be putting him in that space because he can't control it.""
The retired teacher says anyone working with children in care can benefit from the virtual reality program, to help improve their understanding of their behaviour.
""Definitely I can see it for teachers, social workers… anyone where your experiences are different to the experiences of people you're working with,"" she says.
Key Assets and the SA Government say they are now considering expanding the program's reach into other settings, including schools.

What is the singles tax? Here's why you often pay more for going it alone,HBy Hanan Dervisevic,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-02/singles-tax-costs-australians-not-in-couples/104961184,"When the rent lands for Emma Young's Brisbane home each month, there's nobody to split it with.
The same goes for utilities.
And when the 34-year-old travels, it costs her the same price as a couple.
These are examples of the so-called singles tax, and data shows it could be costing solo Australians hundreds of dollars a month.
Here's how it works, including what the numbers tell us, and which expenses are affected the most.
The singles tax is a term used to refer to the extra money unpartnered people have to pay to match the lifestyle of their paired-up counterparts.
Essentially, it's the extra financial burden you pay for not being in a relationship.
Financial wellness coach Betsy Westcott says it isn't an actual tax from the government, but can still hit your hip pocket.
""Everyday costs like rent, utilities and even some tax benefits tend to be structured around households with multiple incomes, so if you're flying solo, you likely end up paying a bit extra,"" Ms Westcott tells the ABC.
Betsy Westcott says there's an economy of scale that comes with being partnered that single people can't access. (Supplied)
According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), an average one-person household spends $2,835 per month on living costs compared to couples who spend a combined $4,118 per month, or $2,059 per person.
That's a difference of $776.
Data from YouGov research commissioned by iSelect in 2023 came back with a similar outcome.
It found single Aussies with no kids paid an estimated $7,691 more per year on living expenses compared to a double income household with no kids.
Ms Westcott says these numbers bring home the ""cold hard costs"" of flying solo.
""The $776 a month is a big figure, but that's even bigger when you extrapolate that out over a year — $9,312 — or twenty years — $186,240,"" she says.
""That's money that could be otherwise put toward supporting your lifestyle, savings goals or be used to create wealth.""
Going it alone can come with a hidden financial burden. (ABC News: Daniel Irvine)
Analysis of ABS data by RMIT economist Alicia Bubb found the average single spends about 3.5 per cent more on goods and services than couples.
That's based on the 2015–16 ABS household expenditure survey — the most recent numbers available.
However, Ms Bubb believes the gap has likely grown closer to 10–15 per cent due to sharp increases in rent and utility bills.
Ms Young has also calculated how much extra she was paying per year compared to friends in a relationship.
The figure came out at roughly $20,000. To come to that conclusion, she took into account:
You're unable to split important everyday costs.
Ms Westcott refers to this as the economy of scale — many expenses have a baseline cost that you can't share when you're single.
Think things like rent or mortgage, groceries, utilities, and travel. For example, a single person renting a one-bedroom apartment has to bear the full cost, while a couple sharing it can split the rent and all other costs involved.
Ms Young says it can be hard for people on the outside to understand how individuals are impacted.
""I had a friend comment a few years ago that I earn more so I should be saving more and shouldn't have to worry as much,"" she says.
""I do earn more than her, but by the time I include her partner's income, I actually earn significantly less.
""When I explained this to her, she was shocked and never said anything again.
""It's tough but I know it comes from a place of innocence and not knowing.""
A survey found a single person household spends $107 a week on groceries, compared to $163 for a two person household. (Supplied: Woolworths Group)
The fixed and unavoidable costs.
Ms Westcott says housing is ""by far the most significant expense"" and a single person will bear the full burden of this alone.
The rent or purchase price of a one bedroom apartment is not half the price of a two bedroom apartment.
And if a couple resides in a one bedroom apartment, they'll save even more.
Here are a few examples where this is evident in rental prices, according to realestate.com.au:
Bankstown unit/apartment:
If the two-bedroom household splits their costs in half, that's only $277.50 each.
Coorparoo unit/apartment:
If the two-bedroom household splits their costs in half, that's only $275 each.
South Yarra unit/apartment:
If the two-bedroom household splits their costs in half, that's only $347.50 each.
The singles tax can even apply to share houses, although it's not necessarily like for like.
Let's say there's a three bedroom property — with one couple and two singles. The couple are able to split the cost of their room, while the singles have to fork out the entire cost. If it's $350 per room, the singles pay full while the couple pay $175 each.
It's not just when renting that single people are at a disadvantage. Buying a home is just as hard, or possibly even tougher.
According to CoreLogic, the current national median dwelling price is $814,293. That figure accounts for both houses and units.
Here's a breakdown of how much you need to be earning to afford a property at the median value in your capital city.
But how much income would you need to purchase a property at that price?
$159,156 (net income).
For more information on how we calculated this, head to this story.
For dual income earners, this figure might be manageable as each could earn at least $80,000 to reach the target.
But as the average yearly salary in Australia is $102,741 for a full-time adult, a single income doesn't come close to earning enough to afford the national median property price.
Ms Westcott says it is getting harder for singles to afford a slice of the property pie.
""You have less income available, which means it's tougher to save for a deposit, and you need a much higher salary to secure a loan,"" she says.
""Single people also have to take on 100 per cent of the ongoing expenses, making home ownership less affordable and often delaying entry into the market.
But she says it's not impossible for singles to buy a property. Rather, it's more challenging and may take longer than a couple who combine their resources.
The singles tax doesn't just affect housing and can also extend beyond our ""essential needs"".
It can also include:
April Maciejowski says she's felt the singles tax numerous times, and it can come up in the most basic of circumstances.
April Maciejowski says the singles tax is very real. (Supplied)
""One thing that has probably been the most costly is going to weddings without a partner, especially a destination wedding,"" the 32-year-old from Wollongong said.
""With no one to split accommodation with, contribute to a gift, or split Ubers with the cost literally double.
""It all really adds up.""
Asha (real name not used) also provided a common example:
Seven of her friends were going in for a group present. There were two couples and three singles.
One couple wanted to split the present evenly five ways. The three singles wanted to split it evenly seven ways. The other couple weren't fussed.
So in the end, it was split five ways. In this case, the singles ended up paying more.
The money side of the singles tax isn't the only issue.
Ms Maciejowski says emotional wellbeing is also affected.
""With no-one to share the load of day-to-day life or split tasks at home, the toll mentally is also quite draining.""
Ms Westcott says we should also be aware of a more insidious form of the singles tax — delaying pursuing financial goals until a partner is found.
""Time is your super power when it comes to wealth creation,"" she says.

Life Matters is here to help you get a handle on all the important stuff: love, sex, fitness, health, parenting, career, finances and family.
She found that both new and experienced fathers confessed to struggling with the changes a new baby can bring, while some felt an unexpected impact on their mental health.
Feeling ""ridiculously unprepared"" for parenthood was also common, as was a sense of guilt.
But what do we know about dad guilt? And what exactly is a passenger parent?
Andy Krista became a father to daughter Frances just over two years ago.
Before becoming a dad, he imagined he'd be an active father who would do his share of pick-ups and drop-offs, as well as prep school lunches.
""My dad was always an active dad, even though he was a working dad. So yeah, I guess that was sort of the standard that I wanted to meet,"" he tells ABC Radio National's Life Matters.
Once baby Frances arrived, Andy happily leaned into the steep learning curve that is being a new parent.
But it was the return to work — and becoming a working dad — that proved most challenging.
""I had a really difficult time transitioning back to not just being a dad but being a working dad. Juggling and switching between being present for work and then also being present for my family.""
It's something new dad Sam Bartley also experienced when it came time for him to return to work following a couple of weeks at home with son Paddy.

""It felt far too soon to be leaving my partner Holly at home and I just didn't feel ready to get back into normal life,"" he says.
Once at work, the dad guilt set in.
""I felt guilty spending a whole week at work just doing things like going to get a coffee with another worker or going out for lunch while Holly was at home doing the hard yards.""
Coping with change, dealing with diminished mental health and dad guilt were only one part of the complex ball of emotions fathers might experience.
Dads also described feeling a lack of agency and fearful of voicing their own preferences and needs, which is referred to as being a passenger parent.

""That was something that rang true with the fathers that I interviewed,"" says Ms Barrett.
""They described trying to help with those early challenges around sleep deprivation or breastfeeding, which — of course — tend to be centred around the mother and baby.
Two dads share their experiences of shifting to part-time work after having children.
""But also wanting to maybe make suggestions but then recognising these weren't always welcome or they weren't always the right ones and feeling bad about it.""
For example, Andy found instances where he was forced to take a back seat once Frances came home.
""Of course, there's the rhetoric around you from the elders and my in-laws that says, 'Oh, she just wants mum.'
""I don't think there's any malicious intent behind that, but I can appreciate how it leads to what they call weaponised incompetence … and that was never something I wanted to do.
""But it's definitely a trap that I'll acknowledge I unintentionally have fallen into at times.""
Perhaps unsurprisingly, the study also revealed that when it came to parenting in those early years, roles are firmly gendered.
""There seems to be this kind of default position where dads are the secondary or the sidekick parent at the beginning, often for practical reasons and sometimes social reasons,"" explains Ms Barrett.
""But then as the journey progresses, they seem to be kind of stuck in this position and not knowing how to integrate into the parenting journey and to actually make contributions that they think will be useful.""
As for the dilemma of trying to balance fatherhood with becoming a working parent, Ms Barrett puts this down to fathers returning to work a lot earlier than mothers.

""Nowadays, of course, there's partner leave but compared to mothers, they tend to take a lot less time off with the result that they're straight back into work and they've got this challenge where they're trying to balance these priorities,"" she says.
""The dads I interviewed described this immense shift in priorities because actually a lot of dads … didn't expect how satisfying, how joyful, how much love they would feel after the arrival of their baby.""
Unlike previous studies that have focused on the first year of parenting, the study involved men from across Australia with children from newborn age to eight years old.
Its broadened scope revealed a surprising finding: fathers who experienced dad guilt also carried these feelings for longer.
""It wasn't just feeling guilt around the pain their partner experienced at the time or in the days after [birth],"" says Ms Barrett.
It's something Sam is aware of following the ""traumatic"" birth of Paddy, made worse by the soon-to-be-dad's positive COVID-19 test while he was at the hospital getting ready for the birth.
""That was a bit full on. Luckily, they put us in a room by ourselves … But when Paddy came out, there [were] complications so Holly and the baby got rushed out of the room,"" he says.
""I was left by myself for about three hours, and I was just in shock. Yeah, it was rough.""
Andy deals with his dad guilt by trying to find ways to be an active and productive parent.
""Things like getting the next load of washing ready or cleaning up the dishes while my partner is trying to get Frances into bed,"" he explains.
""Or just trying to take turns with things rather than just sitting on the couch and doom scrolling because I find that that's only going to worsen the situation.
""And I think having an open line of communication with my partner as well is really paramount to that.
Dr Karl knows the best app for free podcasts, radio, music, news and audiobooks … and you don't need to be a scientist to find it!
""Not necessarily addressing things when something happens but maybe … taking a pause after the dust has settled to have a conversation about something that we might disagree upon.""
It's important to have conversations about this before the baby arrives, Ms Barrett says.
""Have a chat about what you think your roles might look like and how you would be willing to give and take should your preferences change.
""Early parenting educators have a role to play in this as well. Planting the seed of 'have you thought about this?'
""Likewise, supportive employers. They can step up as well and instigate those conversations and say, 'Look, we're going to have a chat about it prior to baby's arrival. What kind of leave are you going to take?'""
Raising children can often be hard work, but no one needs to feel guilty about doing their best as a parent.",ABC News,lifestyle
Do potatoes deserve their bad reputation as an unhealthy food?,Jessica Schremmer,https://www.abc.net.au/news/rural/2025-03-17/potato-varieties-may-help-shed-unhealthy-reputation/105002276,"Potatoes have gained a reputation as an unhealthy, high-carb vegetable that's best avoided if you want to stay fit.
But where did this belief come from, and is it justified?
For years potatoes were a staple vegetable in many households.
In the 1950s and 1960s, Australians were well known for their meat and three-veg dinners — with potatoes usually dominating the vegetable servings.
They were relatively cheap and widely available. You could even grow them in your own backyard.
So where did it all go wrong for the once-loved spud?

The bad reputation of potatoes is unfair, according to dietitian Nicole Senior, and has been fuelled by the rise of low-carb and high-protein diet trends.
Ms Senior says while some potatoes do have a high glycaemic index, because easily digestible starch — such as that in hot, baked potatoes — can rapidly raise blood-glucose levels, it depends on the variety of the potato used and the way it is cooked.
""Potatoes are a nutrient-dense vegetable and a quality carbohydrate,"" she says.
Nutritional benefits include vitamin C, fibre and resistant starch, which increases when potatoes are cooled down and used in a potato salad, for example.
""Resistant starch nourishes all of those beneficial bugs that we have in our bowel and keeps them happy and keeps our bowel healthy,"" she says.
Another tick for potatoes is that coloured-skin varieties include higher antioxidants, which also have health benefits.
Each potato variety has different nutritional values and characteristics. (ABC News: Peter Drought)
The average Australian eats about 17 kilograms of potatoes each year, but most people can't tell a kipfler from a King Edward.
Limited availability of potato varieties at supermarkets and a focus on the vegetable's aesthetics are contributing to this lack of consumer knowledge, according to those in the industry.
The major supermarkets say consumer expectations drive their requirements, and they offer alternative produce offerings to match any shifts in customer behaviour.

Potato suppliers Kerri Farrell and Catherine Ramage, known as the Spud Sisters, are determined to shift consumer understanding about the ubiquitous vegetable.
""At a supermarket, they'll only be offered a washed potato or an unwashed potato or a red potato and a white potato,"" Ms Farrell says.

Ms Farrell says the limited labelling of potatoes in supermarkets contributes to consumer misunderstanding.
""You see a lot of misinformation saying that red potatoes are all waxy, which isn't true,"" she says.
""Potatoes that do baking, roasting, mashing — just because they are washed, doesn't mean they do all those things.""
Midnight Pearl, Andean Sunrise and Prince of Orange are just some of the 40 potato varieties the Spud Sisters source from Victorian farmers on behalf of restaurants and online customers.

Witnessing people's improved eating experience after understanding the use of waxy or starchy potatoes in a dish, is one reason the sisters embarked on their venture.
""They might be different and ugly, but the kookier the potato the better — we're all about what tastes nice,"" Ms Ramage says.
Besides limited labelling, supermarket storage processes and nutritional myths are also holding back the industry, according to South Australian potato farmer Terry Buckley.

He says Australia's focus on the appearance of potatoes reduces their use-by date and makes them go green more quickly.
""You could double their shelf life if you haven't washed them and you keep them in the dark and you package them well,"" he says.
The industry also needs to improve the public's nutritional education, according to Mr Buckley.
""Potatoes are fattening? That's always been pretty much a myth,"" he says.
The taste, not the look, should be guiding consumers' potato purchases, according to grower Terry Buckley. (ABC South East SA: Elsie Adamo)
In Australia, the $1.1 billion industry leads the nation's vegetable production but, worldwide, potatoes are among the most-wasted foods.
Mr Buckley says he has witnessed food waste within the industry due to demands for the ""perfect product"".
""To achieve that amazing white or red [potato], your wastage is very high,"" he says.

But he says consumers are missing out because popular supermarket versions fall short on taste compared with other varieties.
""If you went and bought a packet of them, you'd tip them out on the bench and you'd eat the plastic bag,"" he says.
Growers and suppliers say many potatoes are wasted because shoppers don't like them covered in dirt, which actually preserves their shelf-life. (ABC South East SA: Elsie Adamo)
Potatoes were first farmed in the South American Andes about 8,000 years ago, and there are now about 5,000 varieties worldwide.
Melbourne-based Peruvian chef Alejandro Saravia is dedicated to highlighting the vegetable's benefits to people in Australia.

He says more initiatives are needed to encourage imperfect ingredient purchases to reduce food waste.
""As chefs, our main focus is the taste and the freshness of our ingredients, not how they look. A potato that is not looking perfect, it's not going to taste bad, right?"" he says.
Mr Saravia is determined to elevate potatoes in his dishes. (ABC News: Nicholas White)
Even for chefs, it's difficult to find different potato varieties throughout the year, he says.
Mr Saravia says working with the Spud Sisters has given him the ability to highlight a variety of produce from large commercial to heritage and boutique growers.
""Nothing compares to sourcing directly from the farmers, from the people that are working the land 24/7, and getting their advice,"" he says.

As Mr Saravia puts his effort into elevating the humble spud through his culinary creations, he says consumers' role in shifting behaviours is important too.
""It's also the consumer responsibility of not choosing the nice, big potato and also picking the small ones that are still delicious,"" he says.
""They are still tasty and they will still provide a great source of food for your families.""",ABC News,lifestyle
Why CALD women in Australia have lower participation in cancer screening,By Angelica Silva,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-18/culturally-linguistically-diverse-women-cancer-screening-rates/105031292,"Neha Kumar ""doesn't feel comfortable"" getting her cervical cancer test done, even after losing her mother to cancer.
The 37-year-old former scientist and owner of Artful Yoga Gallery in St Kilda said all of the evidence for early cancer prevention was ""right in front of her"", yet she rarely went to the doctor.
Her mother, Renu, was the same.
Neha believes her mother ""left it way too late"" when she went to the doctor about a scab on her breast.
""She didn't even want to acknowledge there was something wrong on a sensitive part of her body,"" Neha told the ABC.
Neha's mother passed away from breast cancer in 2015.  (Supplied: Neha Kumar)
When her mother finally had it checked, Neha said ""a blur"" of CT scans and MRIs quickly followed.
Renu was diagnosed with stage three breast cancer in 2014.
She died in 2015, leaving behind Neha and her younger sister Rohini.
As a Punjabi Australian woman, Neha said she experienced ""a lot of guilt and shame"" when it came to her body.
""In Western communities, women are encouraged to do things like feel their breasts for cancer lumps,"" she said.
""But in South Asian communities, this is big thing for us to not do.
Neha says going to the doctor to prevent cancer early on isn't normalised in the South Asian community.  (Supplied: Neha Kumar)
Neha said the mindset around cancer prevention was ""warped"" in the South Asian community.
""We don't go to the doctor unless something is physically wrong with our bodies,"" she said.
""It's never about going to the doctor to prevent something.""
Cancer screening is also a difficult topic in the Vietnamese community, said Ahn Le, who worked as an oncology nurse for six years.
Ms Le said her patients in Melbourne were mainly South-East Asian women.
""I noticed many women would come in for tests or treatment alone, or with a child that could interpret for them,"" she told the ABC.
Many in the Vietnamese community are reluctant to speak about being treated for cancer. 


  (Reuters: Enrique Castro-Mendivil)
For many people in Asian communities, family reputation and honour are tied up in this stigma.
A diagnosis like cancer can ""bring shame"" to the family.
This can be especially true in communities where public perception is important, and families may feel pressure to hide the illness.
""I often saw patients being blamed for their cancer by family members, especially if they were quite superstitious,"" Ms Le said.
This stigma remains a barrier to culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) women seeking cancer treatment.
Pull the lens back further and the list of barriers grows —  language, traditional beliefs and discrimination.
This was more the case for new migrants in Australia, said Shantha Viswanathan, the president of Pink Sari Inc.
Pink Sari Inc is a not-for-profit organisation run by a team of volunteers working to increase cancer screening among Indian, Sri Lankan, Bangladeshi, Nepalese and Pakistani communities in NSW.

Ms Viswanathan said some new migrants may not be aware of cancer screening programs because of limited health literacy and lower engagement with mainstream media.
""I was a new migrant myself,"" Ms Viswanathan, who lives in Sydney, told the ABC.
Ms Viswanathan said some new migrants may not be aware of cancer screening programs because of limited health literacy and lower engagement with mainstream media.
Dr Usha Salagame, a cancer researcher who is a member of Pink Sari Inc, added the issue of ""competing priorities"".
""There is a question of, among so many competing priorities, if I'm not sick, why do I need to worry about it?,"" Usha said.

Health service providers' and physicians' limited understanding of the specific cultural contexts of CALD women is also a barrier.
""This can lead to communication gaps, experiences of patronising attitudes and condescending behaviour, real or perceived experiences, "" Dr Salagame said.
Screening rates in CALD communities are consistently lower than for the general population, 2022 data from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare shows.
Researchers say while diagnosis rates are high, the mortality rate has improved.
Karen Canfell, chair of Cancer Council’s Cancer Screening and Immunisation Committee, said ways to bring down these barriers were constantly being investigated.
But that's difficult when there is not enough data to estimate screening participation figures for different communities.
""This is because we need to know how many screening invitations were sent out to members of each diverse population group,"" Professor Canfell said.
""As well as the number of people in each group who participated in the screening programs to accurately report on screening participation rates for diverse communities.""
As a former healthcare professional, Ms Le said she and her colleagues ""constantly advocated"" for cancer testing among the Vietnamese community.
Ms Le said it was vital to educate communities about the importance of preventive measures.
""Do your screenings. If you see symptoms or are experiencing pains, get it checked out,"" she said.
""Don't wait until the pain or the symptoms are so severe that you get sent to hospital or your GP.""
Professor Canfell says more needs to be done to provide equitable access to cancer screening.  (Pexels: Michelle Leman)
Professor Canfell said death rates in Australia from breast, cervical and bowel cancers had fallen significantly over the past few decades since national cancer screening programs were introduced, despite national participation rates rarely reaching benchmarks.
She said well-researched and evaluated communications campaigns could increase participation.
""Particularly, when they use messaging tailored to the needs of specific communities and work in partnership with community experts to develop culturally appropriate and relevant messages for non-English speaking communities,"" she said.",ABC News,lifestyle
Easy indoor plant hacks: things you can do to make your plants look extra lush,By Anna Chisholm,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-07/keeping-indoor-plants-lush/105018502,"Indoor plants can bring colour and life to a room, but yellowing leaves and sloping stems can be less inspiring.
Experts say there are simple things you can do to help your plants stay vibrant and lush.
Horticulturalist Tamara Campbell is the owner of an indoor plant store in Naarm/Melbourne, and she says devil's ivy vines can be prone to bald patches.

To remedy this, she suggests cutting back some of the vines and propagating cuttings. Once established, ""pop [them] back into the soil and fill out the space more"".
""It will also encourage the plant … to branch out and thicken up.""
Ms Campbell says the ""other option"" is to ""wind the bald stem around the pot and pin it down so it's in contact with the soil"".
She says nodes along the stem ""will activate and send down roots and … a new shoot of foliage [will] come out"".
Plant enthusiast Mike Sullivan says devil's ivy vines can lose their leaves for a multitude of reasons, from a lack of sunlight to under-watering.
Mr Sullivan shares plant care tips on social media and has an online store selling plant stakes and planters.
He says young Monstera deliciosa, or Swiss cheese plants are ""best staked straight away"" to train them to grow vertically.
He says this can help avoid the ""hunchback monstera, or sad-looking splayed-out monstera"" scenario.
This can be done with mature plants too.
In nature, monstera often grows against or onto large tree trunks, explains Mr Sullivan. A stake mimics the support a tree trunk would offer, helping the plant grow upwards.
This also avoids stems breaking and increases the access of leaves to sunlight.

Greg Moore is a senior research associate at the University of Melbourne with an interest in horticultural plant science, revegetation and ecology.
For keeping plants foliage lush looking, Dr Moore says ""the first thing I'd recommend is you dust them"".
Ms Campbell says by growing plants indoors, we're already reducing their access to natural light.
Tamara Campbell says dusting leaves regularly will help your plant absorb light and stay healthy. (ABC Lifestyle: Anna Chisholm)
She says a layer of dust across indoor plants not only looks bad, ""it's like putting a curtain over them"".
""Every time we clean the leaf, we're allowing the maximum amount of light to penetrate the leaf.
""You just end up with a healthier, happy-looking plant.""
To keep foliage looking good, Dr Moore says to check ""where the ducts to your air conditioning and your heating are"" and where the air is flowing from split systems in your home.
He says plants placed in their path aren't going to look their best.
Whether it's cool or warm air, ""the airflow across the leaf dries the leaf out"".
Dr Moore also says some ""selective pruning"" of any unwanted yellow or brown foliage can help improve airflow around indoor plants and improve the overall appearance when it ""doesn't look quite right"".",ABC News,lifestyle

Having a to-do list is key. I also have a to-do list every day and if I don't get those things done, they're added to the next day.
Every day — sometimes twice or three times a day, depending on my stress levels and anxiety — I remove myself from whatever I'm doing if I'm feeling overwhelmed. I'll go outside and I'll shut my eyes, and I'll just listen to the sounds that I can hear around me and take 10 deep breaths.

I've had to really adjust my training to suit my energy levels and that was really hard to do at first because I've always been an all-systems-go, high-intensity, 'let's do burpees' kind of person.

How to prevent mould from taking hold in your home after ex-Tropical Cyclone Alfred,EBy Elissa Steedman,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-11/how-to-prevent-and-remove-mould-in-your-home-cyclone-alfred/105037666,"If you live in an area that was lashed by ex-Tropical Cyclone Alfred, chances are your home is feeling a little damp right now.
And with damp comes the unwelcome likelihood of mould appearing on your walls, furniture and belongings.
While it can be a headache to keep at bay, it can also be toxic and a risk to your health.
Here's what you need to know about containing mould before it breaks out.
Mould is a type of fungi that grows in poorly ventilated spaces such as kitchens, bathrooms and laundries.
It's most attracted to areas where there has been flooding or dampness, but dust and dirt can also encourage its growth.
It can grow on a variety of surfaces, including paper, cardboard, wood, wallpaper, carpet, fabric and upholstery.
In the right conditions, mould can begin to spread in a matter of days.  (ABC News: Alice Pavlovic)
It really depends on factors such as your home's exposure to water and the humidity.
In the right conditions, mould can start showing up in as little as 48 hours.
Mould thrives in damp and humid settings, so reducing these conditions is key.
When it's a sunny day, allow as much sunlight and fresh air into your home as possible.
But if your area continues to stay wet and humid, try using a dehumidifier, or running your air conditioner on a dry cycle.
Make sure your furniture isn't pushed up against walls to allow for airflow.
Absorbent beads can help soak up moisture in wardrobes and other areas.
Moving your indoor plants outside until the weather dries up can also help lower your home's air moisture.

If mould has already sprung up at your house, avoid using a broom or brush to remove it.
Instead, wipe down affected surfaces with a mix of three parts vinegar and two parts water.
The secret to getting rid of mould is a combination of clove oil and vinegar, an experienced cleaner says.
Clove oil can also be a useful tool in your arsenal, but it can discolour some surfaces and trigger allergies.
If the mould is a bit more stubborn, you can use a diluted bleach solution.
But make sure the room is well-ventilated and you wear protective clothing.
You should also ensure any vinegar from previous attempts has been cleaned away, as vinegar and bleach are unsafe to mix.
Any cloths you use to clean mould should be thrown away to avoid the spread of spores through your house.
If you find you have a widespread mould issue, it's worth tackling the root cause first.
Consider whether factors such as a lack of ventilation, a leaky tap or high humidity are causing mould to thrive in your home.
Some insurance providers will assist with removing mould, improving home ventilation and replacing damaged items.
While most insurance policies do not cover mould as a primary cause of damage, they may if it's secondary to an insured event such as a cyclone or flooding.",ABC News,lifestyle
"IVF alternatives, how much they cost, and if they're right for you",KBy Kellie Scott,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-17/the-options-before-ivf-and-how-much-they-cost/104961252,"When you think of infertility, it's likely IVF (in vitro fertilisation) also comes to mind.
""IVF has become the go-to fertility treatment and I think everyone knows what IVF is now,"" says Karin Hammarberg, an adjunct senior research fellow at Monash University with 20 years' experience as a clinical coordinator of IVF programs.
And while in many cases IVF treatment is valid for individuals and couples who need help to conceive, Dr Hammarberg is concerned people aren't as aware of other treatment options.
This is partly due to what she says are ""marketing ploys"" when it comes to fertility advertising.
""Most fertility specialists, and even your GP, would suggest the less invasive [treatments] if there is something simple you can do.
""[But] there are a lot of problems in terms of the lack of transparency in advertising,"" she says, pointing to misleading claims, and social media and influencers as part of the issue.
Often in a vulnerable and desperate state, Dr Hammarberg says women are also marketed controversial products such as the ""egg timer test"", not to mention the amount of non-evidence-based products pushed by the wellness industry.
A basic understanding of available science-backed treatments can be helpful when navigating the world of infertility.
We look at what's available, the costs, and when alternatives to IVF might be relevant for you.
If you've been trying to conceive for more than six months and you're not pregnant, Manuela Toledo says it's worth seeing a fertility specialist.
She's a board member with the Fertility Society of Australian and New Zealand, medical director at TasIVF, and a fertility specialist at Melbourne IVF.
""And that does not mean you will be [automatically] channelled into IVF. We don't want to do IVF on a couple who may not need it.""
Preceding any treatment recommendations, Dr Toledo says a GP or specialist will organise baseline testing including blood tests, ultrasounds and sperm analysis.
Testing attracts varying costs, with Medicare rebates available.
The initial consultation fee with a fertility specialist is on average $220 to $350, and Medicare will reimburse a portion of that.
In some cases, people require surgery to investigate and treat symptoms and conditions.
Dr Hammarberg says being in good general health is a helpful starting point for anyone trying to conceive.
Making lifestyle changes to improve health can be done at home and with minimal cost.
Egg freezing is often sold by fertility clinics as an ""insurance policy"". But some experts say it's more like a lottery, and few women return to use their frozen eggs.
""Having a balanced diet, exercising regularly, not smoking and not drinking are all really important for anyone trying to get pregnant,"" Dr Hammarberg says.
She advises women trying to conceive take iron (if levels are inadequate) and folate (to prevent birth defects), but save their money by avoiding most other supplements given they ""don't have a lot of good evidence"" to back up their use.
Dr Toledo says the two main lifestyle factors that will impact fertility are smoking and being overweight, and addressing that can make natural conception more possible.
If you do undergo IVF at some point, she says positive lifestyle changes can mean it may ""work more quickly and with better outcomes"".
Dr Toledo also recommends patients have regular sex, because ovulation tracking apps and kits can be inaccurate.
""Ideally for natural conception, couples should have sex twice during the week, and once on the weekend.
""The other advantage of that approach is that you have a new wave of sperm coming every two to three days, which is really good for sperm health.""
With busy lives and distractions, frequent sex can feel like a lot of pressure for some couples, and we'll come back to that later.
There is also the option to simply wait, says Dr Hammarberg, especially if you are in your 20s or early 30s.
""There is a chance in the next 12 months you will conceive if there is nothing obviously wrong,"" she says.
Dr Hammarberg recommends using Your Fertility's unexplained infertility tool to help guide you.
Setting clear parameters to end IVF, with or without a baby, was a huge relief to me.
Ovulation induction is an ideal option for people with irregular menstrual cycles, Dr Toledo says.
It involves taking medication to induce ovulation by encouraging eggs to develop in the ovaries and be released, increasing the chance of conception through timed intercourse or artificial insemination, also known as intrauterine insemination (IUI).
IUI involves inserting sperm into the uterus close to the time of ovulation.
""These are really good for same-sex couples using sperm, but also heterosexual couples that are just finding it difficult to have intercourse every second or third day,"" Dr Toledo says.
Ovulation stimulation and IUI can ""take the pressure off"", she says. That pressure can sometimes lead to sex feeling like a chore and even sexual difficulties such as erectile dysfunction.
""We can do the IUI at peak fertility … then couples can have intercourse when they feel like it.""
Or, couples know when peak fertility is and can time intercourse more accurately, as the woman's cycle is tracked with ultrasound.
IUI is helpful for same-sex couples, but also heterosexual couples that are finding it hard to have regular intercourse, says Dr Toledo. (Pexels)
Ovulation induction can range from a few hundred dollars to about $1000 (and only receives a Medicare rebate when involving an insemination procedure.)
IUI can range from about $1,000 to $3,000, with a rebate available.
Most fertility clinics have costs for services available on their websites.
For women under 35 especially, Dr Toledo says ovulation induction with or without IUI can have positive outcomes.
Dr Hammarberg says overall, these treatments have lower success rates when compared to IVF, which is purely a numbers game.
""Imagine one menstrual cycle with IUI, but with IVF you might get 10 eggs and create five embryos, so cumulatively, each IVF cycle will give you more of a chance than IUI cycle.""
There are cases where IVF may be recommended to individuals and couples over less invasive options, says Dr Hammarberg.
""Age is the one thing that trumps everything else.
""If a woman is 39, it's not really a good time to think 'Maybe I could give myself a year to try something else'.""
She says for patients with ""clear cut"" cases such as blocked fallopian tubes, IVF will be the best option.
Dr Toledo says for older women with unexplained infertility, she may still recommend less invasive treatments while ""getting ready for IVF"".
""Obviously if the women is mid to late 30s, we don't have that much time.""
An IVF cycle can cost on average between $10,000 and $12,000, with about half reimbursed by Medicare.

Dermatologists share their verdict on beef tallow in skincare,By Anna Chisholm,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-21/beef-tallow-skincare/105074718,"Is beef tallow something you associate more with the kitchen or the bathroom cabinet?
Hannah English is a skincare author and digital creator who reviews products and documents her own routines on social media from Naarm/Melbourne.

She says she now ""fairly regularly"" gets questions from her followers about using beef tallow or beef tallow-based products as skincare, and it also pops up on her own feeds.
Hannah says she's nervous about some of the content she's seen promoting beef tallow, because of other ideas endorsed alongside it.
""I got a video of someone saying that 'skin care is fake … don't use sunscreen and all I use is a bit of beef tallow now and then and my skin's never been better'.""
Beef tallow is made using cattle fat and is a by-product of meat processing. Tallow can be used as a cooking oil but is also being used in biofuel and animal feed as well as cosmetics and skincare.
Experts explain what divides a budget sunscreen from a bougie one.
Michael Freeman is a dermatologist working on the Gold Coast / Yugambeh language region.
Dr Freeman says because beef tallow is a ""biological compound"" with ""lots of fatty acids"" it's relatively compatible with our skin.
Beef tallow also contains stearic acid and oleic acid which ""have got skin softening, hydration [and] repair characteristics"". This means it could be suitable for skin experiencing eczema or psoriasis, he says.
It also contains Vitamin A, Vitamin D, Vitamin E, and Vitamin K, which he says are all used in skin products.
Dr Freeman says the animal's diet will have an impact on tallow's characteristics.
Mei-Heng Tan, a dermatologist on Gadigal Land in Sydney, says these fatty acids and vitamins ""are beneficial for maintaining healthy skin, promoting healing, and improving skin elasticity"".
It's a ""natural emollient, meaning it helps to lock in moisture"", and can be ""especially helpful for dry and cracked skin"".
Beef tallow is best suited to dry, sensitive skin or skin prone to eczema or psoriasis, according to Dr Freeman.
But he warns that ""you wouldn't want to use beef tallow as a raw product"".
Once used as cooking oil, tallow is now being used is used in a variety of ways. (Flickr: Shaun Taylor.)
It doesn't take much, however, to make it into a usable skincare product. This allows some producers to avoid fragrances, preservatives and stabilisers in some formulations, which can be helpful for people who are sensitive to any of those.
Dr Tan adds that raw beef tallow, rendered at home, ""can have impurities or contaminants that may cause irritation or infection"".
Additionally, raw tallow can ""be greasy or difficult to apply evenly"" and becomes solid at room temperature.
If stored improperly, it can also go rancid.
""Commercial skincare products with tallow are generally tested for safety and stability, ensuring that the product will remain effective and free from bacterial contamination for the intended shelf life.""
Formulated skincare products are also likely to include other beneficial ingredients, Dr Tan says.
Dr Tan says there are ""several potential disadvantages"" that come with using beef tallow as skincare.
Beef tallow has comedogenic — or pore-clogging — potential.
""For individuals with oily or acne-prone skin, it may clog pores, leading to breakouts or blackheads … and it may exacerbate conditions like acne or rosacea.""
It can also have a lingering scent that ""might not be appealing for everyone"", Dr Tan warns.
Some people may have an allergy or sensitivity to beef tallow, and ""it's always a good idea to do a patch test before applying tallow-based products on larger areas of the skin"".
Dr Tan also says beef tallow won't align with everyone's values as it is animal-derived.
If you're searching for a rich moisturiser, Dr Freeman says it does tend to come down to personal preferences.
Skincare dupes are cheaper products that claim to match the look, feel, and effectiveness of more luxury offerings. But do they do what they say?
You could consider a moisturiser containing ceramides, which tallow does not have and, ""which are in fact the very thing that a lot of people with dry skin miss out on"".
Glycerin is also ""a very helpful ingredient"", he adds.
Hannah says when she wants a rich product that has a ""trapping moisture into the skin effect"" she opts for a simple petroleum jelly product.
""It's also really, really affordable,"" she says.
Dr Tan also recommends petroleum jelly as a ""moisturiser for dry cracked skin and lip care"", but ""if you prefer plant-based alternatives, options like shea butter, coconut oil, and jojoba oil are excellent choices"".
""For a lighter, more non-comedogenic option, consider oils like grapeseed or argan oil.""
Be aware that all these ingredients have their own unique disadvantages and benefits and finding what works best for you and your skin is key.",ABC News,lifestyle
Kashus Culpepper learnt guitar during COVID — now he plays country's biggest stages,By Dan Condon,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-20/kashus-culpepper-interview-cmc-rocks-festival-navy/105073248,"When we called Kashus Culpepper, the 27-year-old Alabama-bred country singer was days away from a massive career milestone.
He was set board a plane to the UK, where he went on to play the C2C festival alongside superstar country icons like Lainey Wilson, Dierks Bentley and Cody Johnson.
Culpepper is now in Australia to play Queensland's enormous sold-out CMC Rocks festival this weekend.
""This is my first time taking my music internationally, so I'm super excited,"" he beams.
""Ever since I started doing my original music, I've got so many messages from overseas. 'When you coming to the UK? When you coming to Australia?' So I'm just super happy that I'm finally able to come.""
He says finally, but it's not exactly been a long road. In early 2020, Culpepper was a Navy man stationed in Spain. Then, COVID hit and he suddenly had to find something to fill his days.
""Italy had shut down and Spain ended up following suit, so I needed something to occupy my mind,"" he says.
""My buddy found a guitar for me in the barracks. I always wanted to learn guitar. I grew up in an era of Disney Channel and stuff like that, and always thought Jonas Brothers and stuff was pretty cool, like, rocking out on guitar.
""I was like, 'Man, I wish I could do that,' but I never did it when I was growing up.
""So, during COVID, I was like, 'I think it's just time,' because all my favourite artists played instruments.
""I was like, 'I don't have nothing else I'm doing. I can't work. So let me try my hand at guitar and finally buckle down.' It didn't take me too long to start learning chords and end up singing along while I'm playing.""

He quickly picked up a few chords and taught himself how to fill the requests his fellow Navy service people threw at him.
""They wanted me to play 'Sweet Home Alabama', some Fleetwood Mac here and there, some Bill Withers. It was all over the place,"" he recalls.
""I had the time of my life while I was over there because that gave me the opportunity to learn so many new songs I never would have picked up because people wanted me to learn them and play it for them at the campfires we'd have.
Culpepper's love of music stems far further than the day he picked up a guitar though. Since childhood, he'd sing in the church in his small community of Alexander City, Alabama. These beginnings, and the way he speaks of them, explains his soulful approach to country music.
""I grew up in a church that was this white little church on top of a hill that we had to walk up to every Sunday morning or Wednesday night if we had Bible study,"" he says.
""We had red pews, the air conditioning didn't work, so everybody's just sweating all the time.
""But it was always packed in there and no matter what troubles you was going through throughout the week, at church everybody put their soul into the music.
""You could just tell, whether you were having a rough week or a happy week, all that came out during singing and the pastor preaching.""
For Culpepper, it was an early insight into music's transformative power. It's ability to unite, and offer an outlet to let their emotions fly.
""I saw firsthand just the real soul of people coming out with singing and praising God in church. That's the first experience I saw with music, and it was really impactful, because it was just so soulful. People just giving their whole being to the singing and the pastoring and preaching.
""I just love the soulfulness of voices and the feeling that it gave me.""

"What to watch in March, from Seth Rogen's The Studio to Shondaland's murder mystery The Residence",By Yasmin Jeffery,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-20/what-to-watch-march-the-studio-seth-rogen-the-residence-shonda/105065180,"Formula 1: Drive to Survive returned with a new season this month ahead of the Australian Grand Prix.
So did the increasingly popular high-fantasy series The Wheel of Time and the Swedish version of the inescapable reality dating show beast that is Love Is Blind.
But it's a far bigger month for new content than it is for returning series, to be honest.
When Matt Remick (Seth Rogen) lands his dream job as a legacy Hollywood studio boss, it's the best day of his life.
Matt is a desperate film bro who's always wanted to be the person who gets to green-light prestige films.
This is why he decides, days after his appointment, to fast-track a Kool-Aid movie in response to Greta Gerwig's Barbie.
As it turns out, Matt's dream job is a nightmare.
The increasingly irrelevant studio is struggling to make money, so his new role is more about killing auteurs' darlings than anything else.
At The Studio, the highs are high and the lows are soul-destroying. (Supplied: Apple TV+)
Within days, Matt morphs into a spineless compulsive liar who shits the bed every chance he gets to make a movie that matters, and capitulates to his boss's every demand.
His bumbling work husband, Sal (Ike Barinholtz), offers little assistance, too preoccupied with his daytime coke habit.
It would all be worth it if he could use his new-found power to produce anything with artistic merit. But is he even capable of doing the thing he's dedicated his life to?
Catherine O'Hara (right), who plays Rogen's (left) recently ousted mentor, is but one of many A-listers in The Studio. (Supplied: Apple TV+)
Co-created, written, directed and executive produced by Rogen (alongside frequent collaborator Evan Goldberg), The Studio is a star-studded, biting satire that gives the only answer that matters to the question of why Hollywood keeps pumping out pointless remake after pointless remake.
There are actually too many A-listers in The Studio to name all of them, but to list a few: Brian Cranston features as the delightfully out-of-touch, vicious studio chief executive; Katherine Hahn stars alongside Rogen as a perfectly condescending underling; and Catherine O'Hara naturally steals every scene she's in as the recently ousted ex-studio boss whose job Matt took.
With jaw-dropping, soul-crushing plot twists that are simultaneously hilarious, at many points during The Studio it feels like this is as good as comedy gets.
The distinctive old-Hollywood-feel colour grade, with luxurious sets and backdrops to match, only add to the appeal of this 10-part comedy.
So yeah, you could say The Studio is a must-see.

The chief usher has just been found dead in the middle of a state dinner at the White House and the circumstances are, of course, mysterious.
There are 132 rooms to inspect and 157 suspects to question — including a real-life Kylie Minogue. (The state dinner is for Australia.)
As Kylie lip syncs 'Can't Get You Out of My Head' to guests downstairs, the brilliant Cordelia Cupp (Uzo Aduba) is brought in to investigate the death of A.B. Wynter (Giancarlo Esposito).
Aduba's delightfully eccentric, neurodivergent-coded detective is far from convinced he died by suicide.
This is the opposite of what the White House suits want: their fledgling administration has been in freefall for the past six months and now a dead man has been discovered at the first state dinner.

Cordelia must also contend with Edwin Park (Randall Park), the FBI special agent following her around to make sure she doesn't uncover anything the administration would consider undesirable.
We know from the outset it doesn't go well for her — the story starts with a Congressional hearing into the night of A.B.'s death and the investigation that followed.
Produced by Shondaland, this layered whodunnit has twists in all the right places, and the White House setting adds another layer of compelling political intrigue to the drama. But it's also a comedy, and Aduba's brilliantly executed deadpan delivery adds light to balance out all the dark.

Produced by Jamie Foxx and Kevin Hart, this documentary, told in two parts, sees some of Hollywood's biggest Black actors reveal the breakthrough moments in their careers and reflect on the contributions of those who paved the way in a series of poignant, intimate interviews.
The journey to cementing themselves as stars was often something else entirely, influenced by changing political landscapes and periods of social upheaval, tokenism, misogyny, Eurocentric beauty standards, and the few roles on offer. Among other things, of course.
You can expect revelations from the likes of Whoopi Goldberg, Eddie Murphy, Cynthia Erivo, Denzel Washington, Gabrielle Union, Idris Elba, and many more.
Number One on the Call Sheet looks to be joyful, moving, enlightening and infuriating, and like it will most likely be slept on, though it shouldn't be.

Melissa (Annaleigh Ashford) has a secret.
On the surface, she's a mother of two with a loving husband who spends her days doing make-up on a problematic daytime talk show.
It's a facade she's spent 15 years painstakingly curating.
That life begins falling apart one morning, after a card arrives in the mail from her father: the incarcerated Happy Face serial killer, Keith Hunter Jesperson (Dennis Quaid).
Keith has also spoken to Melissa's boss, the Dr-Phil-inspired Dr Greg (David Harewood), claiming he killed one more person than the eight he was sent away for. He insists he'll only speak to two people about it: Dr Greg and Melissa.
As a talk show host who's built a TV empire off exploiting vulnerable people in crisis, Dr Greg pushes her to investigate.
Melissa is unsure whether her dad is lying and trying to manipulate her or if determining the truth is her responsibility.
Then she finds out an innocent man could be put to death for the crime her father claims credit for.
Happy Face is but the latest in a glut of real true-crime stories to get the TV treatment of late, but this one is more than just trauma porn.
For one, Melissa G Moore, the daughter of the real-life Happy Face killer, executive produced the series herself (off the back of the Happy Face Podcast and autobiography Shattered Silence, which she co-wrote).
And Ashford and Quaid, respectively, deliver nuanced and delightfully creepy performances.
The result is a series that's as much a meditation on the love we have for our parents in spite of the things they may do and the importance of dealing with your trauma, as it is a gripping true-crime story.

As one of the most feared predators in our oceans, sharks get a bad rap.
Steve Backshall thinks they're just misunderstood.
In this docuseries, the British naturalist and explorer (+head of shark PR?) proves that hunting defenceless prey isn't what they're all about.
Starting with the Caribbean reef shark in the Bahamas, Backshall introduces us to the diverse variety of sharks that populate the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific oceans.
From there, we learn about the issues they face, from climate change, to pollution and overfishing.
But this four-part series also demonstrates the weird and wonderful behaviours sharks have developed over 400 million years of evolution. It's really a love letter to sharks by a man who's been diving with them for 30 years.
Those with a fear of sharks may find some parts uncomfortable to watch — Backshall doesn't hesitate to get up close to them, and he isn't afraid of mucking about with stingrays in the shallows, either.
But it's still worth watching for the bevy of shark facts you'll walk away with.

"Cassandra Clare on The Ragpicker King, controversy and taking up space as a woman writing fantasy",By Yasmin Jeffery,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-13/cassandra-clare-ragpicker-king-chronicles-of-castellane/105040806,"International bestselling author Cassandra Clare set out to create a fantasy world with a difference.
With her new Chronicles of Castellane trilogy, she wanted to lose the ""faux medieval"" version of Europe we so often see in popular culture where ""everyone is white"" and ""the only food is stew"".
""I'm an Ashkenazi Jew. I come from a long line of people who lived in Europe, who participated in the culture,"" the Massachusetts-based writer tells ABC Arts.
She was also, in her latest work, drawn to her ""guilty pleasure reality show"", Locked Up Abroad; particularly, the story of Latif Yahia — a man who was allegedly forced to serve as a body double for Saddam Hussein's son after being made to undergo plastic surgery to increase their resemblance.
""I thought immediately: 'What's the fantasy version of this, of someone whose identity is so compromised and so wrapped up in someone else's?'"" Clare says.
Her answer to this takes the form of a series quite unlike any other.
Clare has a history of writing diverse characters.
Her most popular series, The Shadowhunter Chronicles, comprises 17 novels and has sold millions of copies since the first book in the YA fantasy franchise was published in 2007. It's since been adapted into a film starring Lily Collins and Jamie Campbell Bower, as well as a TV series.
The books prominently feature queer, Jewish and neurodivergent characters, and people of colour.
But Clare reaches new levels of representation with The Chronicles of Castellane, her first foray into high fantasy and adult fiction.
Intricately designed and vividly described, yet easy to follow (we have Clare's YA roots to thank for that), this tale of magic, politics, power and romance sees the veteran fantasy author draw on her own cultural history like never before.
Jewish mythology and folklore seldom seen in the fantasy genre are intrinsic to this series.
The Ragpicker King, the second book in The Chronicles of Castellane following on from Sword Catcher, is out now. (Supplied: Pan Macmillan)
Set between the medieval and renaissance periods, it follows Kel Saren, the body double (the first book's titular ""Sword Catcher"") to Conor Aurelian, crown prince of the multicultural trade city-state of Castellane. Kel lives to die for the man who has become his brother, should he need it.
Both are young, brown, queer men. This is a matter of fact rather than a huge deal.
Then there's Lin Caster, one of few women physicians and a member of the Ashkar, a diasporic group analogous to Jewish people whose lost homeland, Aram, was destroyed long ago. The Ashkar are hated and envied by the malbushim (non-Ashkar), partly because they still have access to small forms of ancestral magic despite all other magic being erased from the world.
As a result, they are subject to discriminatory laws and forced to live in walled communities, which they are forbidden to leave after sundown.
The Ashkar live in hope of a Goddess reborn who, it has been prophesied, will return in the form of an Ashkari girl and lead them to glory.
The series continues with an abundance of conspiracies and threats of exile in the newly released book two, The Ragpicker King.
But the story elements that set the Chronicles of Castellane apart have also served as a point of contention.
Some readers have found Sword Catcher — released three days after the events of October 7, 2023 — all the more poignant given the Israel-Gaza conflict, identifying similarities between the discrimination the Ashkar face and the real-life rise in anti-Semitism and Islamophobia in recent years.
Others have drawn parallels between Aram and Israel.
Clare says she is not in any way ""trying to comment on the current situation in the Middle East"" with The Chronicles of Castellane. (Getty Images: Eric Fougere/Corbis)
One BookTokker argued: ""I don't think that this is the book to read at this point in time because of the way that the Ashkar are talked about and the way that it is implied at the end of the book that they will rediscover their homeland, which they have lost, which is destined for them…
""I do not think this is a book to recommend, that this is a book to talk about, if you are in support of Palestine.""
Clare says she didn't write Aram as a comparison to Israel and that real-world politics have not influenced the story. She doesn't think the Chronicles of Castellane can ""speak directly to current events"". And she doesn't want it to.
""This [story] draws on my own family experience, knowledge of Jewish history and Jewish culture … and I also didn't want to do a one-to-one comparison,"" she explains.
Clare created a different religion and language for the Ashkar, and made Aram ""not Israel, in the sense that it's destroyed … there's nothing there, no-one lives there, it's basically a heap of sand and slag"".
Clare has dealt with — and overcome — controversy before.
Plagiarism allegations were levelled at the author online by some readers relating to her work as a fan-fiction writer in the early 2000s.
Clare brushed them off in a 2014 Guardian interview.
Carissa Broadbent wasn't loving her first ""big-girl job in corporate America"", so she decided to try writing a romantasy book. Now she's a best-selling author.
Then, in 2016, fellow fantasy author Sherrilyn Kenyon sued Clare, claiming Clare used elements from her 1998 Dark-Hunter series in The Shadowhunter Chronicles. Clare later wrote on her tumblr that the copyright infringement elements of the lawsuit had been dropped and the trademark part of the complaint settled.
Then there was the incest controversy.
At the end of the first published book in The Shadowhunter Chronicles, protagonist Clary Fray is told that her love interest, Jace Wayland, is her brother.
The pair struggle deeply with the revelation, but their romantic feelings ultimately do not dissipate, and there is kissing. It takes two more books to get to the reveal that they aren't actually siblings.
Some readers weren't phased by the storyline. Others were.
When asked by the ABC how she's dealt with the controversies in her career, Clare doesn't respond to the plagiarism accusation part of the question.
But on the incest, Clare says ""nobody seemed bothered"" by the storyline until the movie adaptation that came out about six years after the book.
""Suddenly, there were all these people reading it and being very upset about the Jace and Clary thing, especially because the movie doesn't really clarify anything for you.""
Clare hadn't anticipated the backlash.
""I was sort of like, 'This is like a standard piece of business in movies and soap operas.'
""[If] you can handle the amount of brother-sister stuff that's in Star Wars, which is watched by nine-year-olds, you can handle the fact that Jace and Clary think they're brother and sister and then find out that they're not.""
Helen Scheuerer could have traditionally published her debut novel, but she decided to self-publish instead.
Clare trusts herself to handle the complex themes her writing touches on, even if some don't.
She rejects arguments that ""by writing about Clary and Jace, I'm saying, 'You should go out and marry your brother,' or by writing about the Ashkar, I am in any way trying to comment on the current situation in the Middle East … I absolutely am not in any way"".
""I do wonder, if I was a man, would they trust me to handle these topics?""

Why medieval animal art has gone viral on social media,Anna Levy,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-19/viral-medieval-animal-art-on-social-media/105008036,"Snails wielding swords and fighting off knights. Elephants that look like oversized golden retrievers. Dogs with uncanny proportions and hauntingly human eyes. Cats wearing clothes and playing musical instruments.
These are part of a treasure trove of medieval animal illustrations that has taken the internet by storm.
From listicles about ""super ugly medieval dogs"" to Instagram accounts devoted to ""weird medieval guys"", it seems people can't get enough of these pictures — the stranger, the better.
That's something Matthew Ponesse knows well. An associate professor in history at Ohio Dominican University, he runs a medieval meme Instagram account, @medievalistmatt, with over 160,000 followers.
Dr Ponesse says animal imagery is ""a go-to that just always connects"" on his Instagram account. (Supplied: Matthew Ponesse)
""When I first started this account [in 2018], it was simply a means to connect with students,"" he says.
""My students felt so sorry for me, [like] 'He's trying, we should follow him out of pity'. It never even occurred to me to create anything, especially [something] that wasn't historical or educational.""
But soon he realised he could capture his students' attention with memes, even if they weren't necessarily from the early medieval texts that were his area of expertise.
""Social media is meant to be an escape, a diversion — it's clearly a place where my students didn't want to be further burdened with academic content,"" he says.
""So I started challenging myself … I [would] pour myself coffee, give myself an hour, just stare at images and wait for something to hit.
""Most of it is just absolutely absurd and idiotic.""
The account grew slowly until last year when it ""completely skyrocketed"".
""For some reason, this medium and this content really connects [with] a modern audience,"" Dr Ponesse says.
And animals, it seems, are key.
""Animals are just an easy area to go to if I want to post something that I know is just going to immediately be popular and get passed around,"" Dr Ponesse says.
So, how did these artworks make their way from niche historical archives to Instagram feeds? And why do they look so bizarre to us today?
The medieval period, also sometimes known as the Middle Ages, is generally understood to have spanned about 1,000 years, from the 5th century to the start of the Renaissance in the 15th century.
Most of the animal depictions that have made their way into the mainstream are from Western European manuscripts, often in the form of marginalia: small illustrations around the borders of the text.
During this period, books were for ""the medieval 1 per cent"", explains Larisa Grollemond, associate curator of medieval and renaissance manuscripts at the Getty Museum.
This Dutch prayer book from the late medieval period features detailed miniatures to accompany the text. (Public Domain)
""They're created for a really elite readership … A high-ranking nobleman might own a handful of religious texts, including books to guide personal prayer — that's where you see a lot of these funny animals and marginalia,"" she says.
""There are also secular books, like romances, histories, in some cases, music.""
The artists behind the marginalia — known as illuminators — ranged from monks to secular craftspeople in professional ateliers.
Dr Grollemond says the purpose of marginalia has been long debated by medieval art historians. Some say they're satire, others say they demonstrate the ideas of the manuscript, and others say they're purely for fun.
""Medieval people were still people, they had senses of humour. They found a lot of the same things funny that we find funny,"" Dr Grollemond says.
""A medieval person loved a poop joke, a fart joke, just like we do. It turns out that is an element of the human sense of humour that has not been lost over centuries.""
This illustration from a 14th-century manuscript clearly demonstrates a sense of humour. (Public Domain)
The medieval preoccupation with animals comes down to how people lived during this period, says Julia Perratore, associate curator in the Department of Medieval Art and the Cloisters at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
""People lived their lives side-by-side with animals in a way that we do not,"" she says.
""The vast majority of people lived in rural settings and worked on the land, so that meant working with domestic animals.
Images of knights warring against snails are common in marginalia, but historians aren't certain why. (Public Domain)
""People often lived physically closer to animals. It was not so unusual for the human inhabitants of a house to live on the upper storeys and the animal inhabitants to be on the lower storeys because the more you can keep bodies together for warmth, the happier you'll be.""
As a result, animals turned up ""in any possible context where art would be made"", from wall paintings and carved doorways to clothing and coats of arms.
It's no secret that medieval animal paintings don't exactly resemble their real-life counterparts. In fact, it's the subject of most viral memes on the topic.
But Dr Grollemond explains that this wasn't a lack of skill on the part of the artist, but a stylistic choice.
""Medieval artists were not trying to depict animals accurately,"" she says.
""They're not trying to do photorealism. They're trying to communicate certain things about the world around them through the depiction of animals.""
Dr Perratore points to a fresco housed at The Met Cloisters. It features a painting of a camel on the wall of a 12th-century Spanish monastery, which uses flat forms, stylised lines, and bold colours.
""[The artist] is using the stylistic language of the day,"" she says.
""I think some people might look at this and say it's quite simplistic or the person who made it wasn't skilled. I think they're actually highly skilled.
Dr Perratore says the artist behind this camel created ""a form that's quite dynamic, but they're doing it in their own way"". (Public Domain)
This creative licence is more pronounced in depictions of exotic animals. While some medieval courts had menageries, where wild animals were kept for show, most artists were unlikely to have come across a lion, elephant or jaguar.
Dr Perratore says it was like a game of ""telephone"", where a description becomes further from the truth the more it's passed on.
""It's not that they were unskilled, it was that they were making artistic choices based on the information that they had,"" she says.
""They're not trying to be super naturalistic here. It's not their artistic goal.""
This depiction of an elephant from the 15th century suggests the artist wasn't all that familiar with the animal. (Public Domain)
Evidence of these medieval artists' creativity can be seen today. Many of the dragons we find in pop culture — in the popular television series Game of Thrones, for example — are based on medieval interpretations.
That was intentional, too.
""There is such a care, I think, among medieval artists and illuminators to make animal faces say something and a lot of that does happen with the eyes,"" Dr Grollemond says.
The more human-looking animal depictions, like this one from a late medieval altarpiece in Switzerland, make for popular memes. (Public Domain)
""I think they're going for humour in some ways, making things a little bit eye-catching, but especially in cases where animals stand in for moral exemplars, you're supposed to see yourself in that animal.""
This is particularly the case for animals depicted in bestiaries: medieval encyclopedias of real and imagined creatures steeped in Christian theology.
""[The artists] are using animals as examples of Christian lessons and to teach Christian theology, essentially, so all of the animals are imbued with particular behaviours or characteristics that are given to them by God,"" Dr Grollemond says.
Creatures like tigers, stags, pelicans, and panthers — like this one from a 13th-century bestiary — were often symbols of Christ. (Public Domain)
Dr Perratore points to a collection of Western European fables called Reynard the Fox, which was hugely popular in the late medieval period.
""[It] was a great storytelling tradition in which animals essentially played out human social roles,"" she says.
""Animals became ways of telling stories about people, which is universal but was no less loved in the Middle Ages than it is today.""
In every Reynard tale, the fox is summoned before a court of his animal peers for his bad behaviour, only to outfox them with his cunning. (Public Domain)
Well, perhaps the Middle Ages weren't so dark, after all.
""[We had] 1,000 years of history where humanity didn't hide out in a cave while the barbarians ravaged the world. That's not what happened. What really happened was, we kept developing, we kept evolving, we kept creating,"" Dr Ponesse says.
""This is an age that was supposedly barbaric and backwards and ignorant and intolerant, and yet the way they depicted animals is sweet, beautiful, playful.
Animal imagery, like this much-circulated image from a Bavarian coat of arms, was often playful. (Public domain)
While Dr Ponesse says art historians are likely ""rolling their eyes"" at his memes, Dr Perratore and Dr Grollemond are big fans of his Instagram account.
""The sheer inventiveness of a lot of what we encounter in these memes is really a source of continual delight,"" Dr Perratore says.
""I think it's important for people to be exposed to art of the past, no matter how they encounter it … It does help to humanise the past.""
The home of gripping narrative history series. Dive into true stories told by the people who lived through them.
Dr Grollemond thinks the artists behind these memes would have enjoyed them, too.
""It is my fervent belief that medieval people would have loved the internet. The repurposing of [their] art I think would have been very gratifying to illuminators,"" she says.
On his desk, Dr Ponesse has a small paperweight, which he had specially made. On it is written a Latin expression, which translates to: ""The soul is rejuvenated with laughter.""
""I think the world needs a little bit more lightheartedness. It needs a little more cheer,"" he says.
""If I can go back into an age that is supposedly so dark and violent [to] show the lighter side of that, who knows? Maybe it'll make people reconsider the age that we live in and see some of the positive things.""",ABC News,music
DJs to spin their way into hearts of Adelaide Fringe-goers on disability club night,By Matthew Smith,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-21/disco-dj-performs-at-adelaide-fringe-heart-beat-club/105066736,"When James Bull puts on his DJ headphones, the world seems a better place.
""The feeling when you're up there is like — it's surreal, like you get the vibe of your audience,"" he said.

James — or, as he prefers to be known, DJ Bucking Bull — used to jump out his bedroom window as a teenager and go clubbing.
But now he's the one setting the mood on the dance floor, though he admits it might take a moment or two to gauge the vibe of the groovers.
""When I'm up there, I get a bit of stage fright,"" he admitted.

James said his epilepsy had meant he could not go to nightclubs because of the strobing lights.
The experience is not an uncommon one.
Nightclubs are places that are sometimes avoided by people with disabilities, not always out of choice.
""For some disabled people going to a club — if you're a bit of a wobbly disabled person, I can't tell you how many I know [who] have been turned away from clubs by bouncers assuming they're drunk or something,"" said Gaelle Mellis, who is creative director of Tutti Arts, which supports performers with disabilities.

It was those types of attitudes that helped inspire the birth of The Heart Beat Club.
""They wanted to do a club, but do it their way,"" Ms Mellis said.
Such is the demand from budding DJs that each set is limited to 10 songs.
That's a challenge for Lorcan, who has 150 songs on his preferred playlist, including some ""bangers"" in electric dance, house and dubstep.
But DJ Power doesn't care, as long as he can get up there and perform.

"Coober Pedy Drive-in cinema, the last in South Australia, repaired over scorching summer",By Viki Ntafillis,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-18/coober-pedy-drive-in-cinema-repaired-in-scorching-summer/105065408,"When contractor Dan Measey found out on Christmas eve he had won the public tender to rebuild Coober Pedy's drive-in cinema he knew he had a David and Goliath task ahead of him.
That is, he would be David, and working at the height of an outback summer would be his Goliath.
""The biggest enemy for us was the temperature and wind,"" Mr Measey said.
""We had a few days there where we were nudging 45, 46 [degrees Celsius].
""We're lifting sheet metal and long, steel members up into the air.
""Some late evening work and early morning work to try and avoid the heat and wind was really key because some of those things pretty much stopped the job.""
The Coober Pedy Drive-in was repaired during hot and windy conditions this summer. (Facebook: Coober Pedy Drive-in)
The screen was pulled down last October but repairs would not take place until January.
They took about four weeks and were finally completed mid-February — Coober Pedy's hottest time of the year.
Several working bees with local volunteers also contributed to getting the venue running again.
While assessing the site Mr Measey also found much of the timber structure supporting the screen had rotted away over time.

Coober Pedy is in South Australia's outback, about a nine-hour drive north of Adelaide.
Its drive-in cinema is the last in the state after Adelaide's closed in November 2021.
Mr Measey has lived in Coober Pedy on and off, and is also the chair of a community group called Coober Pedy Together.
He said the drive-in had been ""a big part of Coober Pedy's history"" since it opened in 1965.
""Obviously back then no TV, no video, no DVD, no streaming,"" he said.
""The drive-in was open sometimes five, six, seven times a week.
""I remember my mother telling me, back in the 1970s her and Dad, when they first met, used to go there.""

The venue was forced to close when the screen was damaged by a storm on November 16, 2023.
Coober Pedy Drive-in committee chair Chantelle Bamford said the repairs took so long to happen because they were waiting on insurance to confirm if they could cover the costs.

In the end the insurance company covered the entire $150,000 required.
""They [the contractors] did such a good job, and they did it so quickly.""
The asset is owned by the local council but run entirely by a committee of volunteers, and all the money made at the drive-in goes back into running the venue.
Ms Bamford said the drive-in was a major tourist attraction for Coober Pedy with some visiting the town just to have a drive-in experience.
She said the location made the drive-in unique.

"Mariah Carey didn't steal All I Want For Christmas Is You from other writers, judge rules",Ned Hammond,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-21/judge-rules-mariah-carey-did-not-steal-all-i-want-for-christmas/105080190,"A US judge has ruled that Mariah Carey did not steal her perennial mega-hit, All I Want for Christmas Is You,  from other songwriters.
Judge Mónica Ramírez Almadani granted Carey's request for summary judgement on Thursday, giving her and co-writer and co-defendant Walter Afanasieff a victory without going to trial.
In 2023, songwriters Andy Stone of Louisiana — who goes by the stage name Vince Vance — and Troy Powers of Tennessee filed the US$20 million ($32 million) lawsuit alleging that Carey's 1994 song, which has since become a holiday standard and annual streaming sensation, infringed the copyright of their 1989 country song with the same title.
It was the second time Stone sued over the song, after he withdrew a 2022 case.
Their lawyer Gerard P. Fox said he was ""disappointed"" in an email to The Associated Press.
Fox said it is his experience that judges at this level ""nearly always now dismiss a music copyright case and that one must appeal to reverse and get the case to the jury.""
""My client will make a decision shortly on whether to appeal. We filed based on the opinions of two esteemed musicologists who teach at great colleges,"" he said.
In pop music, the line between inspiration and rip-off is blurry. Olivia Rodrigo is the latest to get caught out by it.
Stone and Powers' suit said their All I Want For Christmas Is You song contains a unique linguistic structure where a person, disillusioned with expensive gifts and seasonal comforts, wants to be with their loved one, and accordingly writes a letter to Santa Claus.""
They said there was an ""overwhelming likelihood"" Carey and Afanasieff had heard their song — which at one point reached No.31 on Billboard's Hot Country chart — and infringed their copyright by taking significant elements from it.
After hearing from two experts for each side, Judge Ramírez Almadani agreed with those from the defence, who said the writers employed common Christmas cliches that existed prior to both songs, and that Carey's song used them differently.
She said the plaintiffs had not met the bar of showing that the songs were substantially similar.
Judge Ramírez Almadani also ordered sanctions against the plaintiffs and their lawyers, saying their suit and subsequent filings were frivolous and that the plaintiffs' lawyers ""made no reasonable effort to ensure that the factual contentions asserted have evidentiary support"".
She said they must pay at least part of the defendants' legal fees.
Lawyers for the defence and publicists for Carey did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Carey's Christmas colossus has become an even bigger hit in recent years than it was in the 1990s. During the holiday season, it has reached number one on Billboard's Hot 100 chart — which measures the most popular songs by airplay, sales and streaming — the past six years in a row.
Queensland University of Technology music lecturer Dr Yanto Browning said the law made these types of cases challenging.
""It's hard to copyright a chord progression, for example,"" Dr Browning said.
Musicians Pharrell Williams and Robin Thicke were successfully sued by the estate of Marvin Gaye in 2015 after they claimed Williams' and Thicke's song Blurred Lines infringed on Gaye's 1977 track Got To Give It Up.
Dr Browning said such lawsuits could be based on lyrical and melodic content, and also a more overarching style or ""vibe"".
""It's almost like the textual components as much as the chordal and the lyrical ideas,"" he said.

Dr Browing said the situation was unlikely to get easier in the future, with the rise of generative artificial intelligence.
Musicians have big concerns about AI, but it's up to us to shape its future.
Dr Browning expected individual cases would become increasingly insignificant, taking a back seat to copyright infringement claims that centre on the use of existing music to train AI companies' large language models.
""Now you can go into AI generators and just say 'Give me a folk song in the mould of …' and then that's been trained on all of these other artists,"" he said.
""But there's no talk of, how do you remunerate an entire genre?""",ABC News,music
"QAGOMA's Asia Pacific Triennial has stunning tapestries, spellbinding video and art to delight",Jo Higgins,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-11/apt-qagoma-asia-pacific-triennial-prompts-conversation/105011840,"A mesmerising time-lapse captures up close a melting, multi-coloured block of ice as it disintegrates into swirling pools that resemble otherworldly topographies.
Singaporean artist Dawn Ng's multi-channel video installation, currently on display as part of the 11th Asia Pacific Triennial (APT) at the Queensland Art Gallery and Gallery of Modern Art (QAGOMA), compresses a 20-hour process into an efficient but hypnotic 40 minutes.
An accompanying label explains that Ng is exploring how we experience time: ""Some things seem to take forever, while others are over very quickly"".
Over several screens, a fractured time-lapse captures up close a pigment-infused block of ice as it melts into colourful eddies. Ng says she's ""interested in the ways time is experienced"". (Supplied: Queensland Art Gallery/Dawn Ng. Photo: J Ruckli)
It's a fitting description for the two days I spend absorbed and distracted, dazzled, confounded and moved by the 500 works across APT11, and the time I've spent since, thinking about the experience of looking at art and what it can reveal — about ourselves and the world around us.
APT is QAGOMA's flagship program and it's played an intrinsic role in shaping the gallery's identity nationally and internationally. Since 1993, APT has shown the work of more than 650 artists from 50 different countries across the Asia-Pacific region with more than 4 million visitors.
Its 11th iteration includes 70 artists, collectives and co-curated projects from more than 30 countries and places, including Nepal, Hawaii, Aotearoa New Zealand, Cambodia, Mongolia, Mindanao, the Sulu Archipelago in The Philippines, and Australia. For the first time, artists from Saudi Arabia, Timor-Leste and Uzbekistan also feature.

But it's not this roll-call of countries or artists that makes APT unique. It's that APT never really ends.
As curatorial manager of Asian and Pacific Art, Tarun Nagesh explains, ""APT is an ongoing process, it's not a singular, one-off, curatorial or conceptual gesture.""
The exhibition happens every three years but the conversations and research are ongoing. APT is rich in relationships.
Particularly in the aftermath of Creative Australia rescinding its 2026 Venice Biennale invitation to artist Khaled Sabsabi and curator Michael D'agostino, and the seismic levels of distress and dismay it has invoked, the experience of the Triennial reiterates one thing for me: that it is the work of artists to hold complexity, nuance and space for critical and personal reflection in their work.
And at APT, there is an invitation for viewers to do the same.
Making your way through APT11, across floors and interconnected gallery spaces, themes start to emerge. You notice recurring expressions of care; of attention to environmental and political crises; as well as meditations on the importance of community and cultural knowledge.

Bi-lingual wall labels help to orient you but there's no one prescribed way to read a work and so, moving from room to room, your curiosity becomes your compass.
Curiosity is also what drives APT's curators in their research and relationship-building across the region. This perpetual work, around and between editions is the heft and the magic of APT. It doesn't start with the art and it doesn't end with the exhibition.
""These ideas of care and crisis [that emerged through APT11] were, in some ways, less about the end product of the show and more about the conversations that were happening while developing the show, with the artists and with a lot of our collaborators,"" Nagesh explains.
Ruha Fifita, the curatorial assistant in the Pacific Art team agrees. ""It's not always about specific arts projects with specific people. It can start with what we're learning about the region and the landscape.""
Taiwanese artist Zhang Xu Zhan's stop-motion video installation is just one of the incredible works at APT11. (Supplied: Zhang Xu Zhan/Photo: C Callistemon)
Fifita is also deeply interested in considering the role art plays outside the gallery context.
""I think that's something that's really evident in a lot of the selections across APT — trying to think about working with artists whose work fulfils another, almost primary, function within the context in which they make it. And it's a really nice way to learn not just about an artist's practice but about a place as well.""
For APT11, Fifita worked in Tu'anuku Village in Vava'u, Tonga with weaver and renowned ocean navigator 'Aunofo Havea Funaki to help realise one of the (literally) largest and most ambitious of APT11's commissioned projects.
Funaki is a community leader in Tu'anuku Village and the driving force behind the staggering kutu weaving, Fala Kuta e Toa ko Tavekefai'ana (2024), that overtakes a towering double-height wall space and then continues rolling out over the floor in front of it.
Having also grown up on the island of Vava'u, Fifita understood what the opportunity to make and share work might offer Funaki and the Lepamahanga Women's Group, who wove the mat.
""There are relationships there that are very strong and with a lot of trust, which enabled me to communicate how different this [APT and museum] context is and to invite people into something quite unfamiliar,"" Fifita says.
""Funaki was thinking, 'If we find other reasons to make this, it will also help us to keep at the forefront of our minds the significance of this kuta pond that we care for and the value of our role in that,'"" Fifita says. (Supplied: Aunofo Havea Funaki)
The mat that hangs in APT is an artistically ambitious weaving but it's also an intergenerational project and work of environmental advocacy.
Vava'u is home to Tonga's largest freshwater lake and Funaki and the community are custodians of its surrounding ecosystem, which includes the increasingly scarce reeds that are used in their kutu weavings.
This Triennial features works from more than 70 artists and collectives, and projects from over 30 countries, across virtually every medium, technique and use of material.
""Funaki's experiences as a navigator and what she's learning have always had this parallel where she's thinking about what to do as a climate activist and the projects she wants to do in her women's group, with weavings that respond to some of what she's learning about the region,"" Fifita explains.
At the foot of Funaki's mat is Saudi-Arabian-born, Palestinian artist Dana Awartani's Standing by the ruins (2022). The geometric installation of 439 handmade adobe bricks echoes the textural weft of the mat but it also has its own things to say about collective memory and cultural legacies in the face of conflict.

Leaving out the straw that would normally bind them together, Awartani's bricks have begun to crack. As Nagesh explains, ""She's interested through her practice in thinking about the Middle East and the histories of conflict there and the loss of culture that has meant, whether it's monuments and architecture or the continued ways of making things and knowledge.""
The cracking speaks poetically to this vulnerability but there's also something reverential about Awartani's work. A resilience and deep respect for the traditions of making it sustains.
It's over 16,000km from Tonga to Palestine but those aforementioned threads of care and crisis gently knit these two seemingly disparate works together and it makes for a really moving encounter.
Nearby, Wiradjuri artist Karla Dickens' mixed-media installation, As above, so below (2024), includes works from her 2022 series, Disastrous, which confronts the devastating environmental legacies of exploitative forces and colonial legacies.
On the wall opposite, Mumbai-born Rithika Merchant's large-scale whimsical science-fiction watercolours speculate on life after the planet has become uninhabitable, with fantastical creatures moving in and making do.

Elsewhere, across a large concertina of screens, CAMP Studio's Bombay Tilts Down (2022) deploys zooming single-takes from CCTV footage that pan from out across the horizon down to vendors on the street below who seem to realise they're being watched and so wave back.
Around the corner from here, there's a series of witty video works from Thai artist Kawita Vatanajyankur, where she takes on the task of otherwise mechanised processes — a weaving loom becomes a complex acrobatic performance; a spinning wheel becomes a spider-like dance — to comment on the invisibility of women's labour in textile production and mass manufacturing.
If a sucker-punch can delight you, this is one.

And then there are works of just astonishing beauty. Wardha Shabbir's dazzling experiments with Pakistani miniature painting; Uzbekistan artist Madina Kasimbaeva's sprawling tapestry with its distinctive suzani (needlework) that took four years to complete; Indonesian-born, Tokyo-based Albert Yonathan Setyawan's mandala-like wall of more than 3,000 individually slip-cast terracotta hands and flames.
Early next year, QAGOMA is presenting an exhibition of APT's ""greatest hits"" at London's Victoria & Albert Museum. Some works haven't been shown in decades and it will be the first time they've been shown in Europe.
Wardha Shabbir's artworks are influenced by her home city of Lahore, Pakistan. (Supplied: Wardha Shabbir/Sabrina Amrani Gallery, Madrid)
For Nagesh, who is working on the exhibition, it's not just an opportunity to celebrate some of APT's most important works. It's also a chance to reconsider them within the context of the V&A's own collection and its colonial context.
""We're approaching it with some of the same principles we bring to each Triennial. Thinking about the different expressions of history and colonialism [as well as geographies and politics] and the great diversity to contemporary art that exists in the Asia Pacific region; it's not a conventional idea of contemporary art.""
If there's a work at APT11 that sums up the Triennial's commitment, ambition, energy, reciprocity and delight, for me it's Taiwanese artist Zhang Xu Zhan's cinematic, dizzying stop-motion film, Compound eyes of tropical (2020–2024). It's a 16-minute, single-channel film with accompanying dioramas all made from delicate joss paper and wire.
Mashing Chinese folk dance, mythological archetypes, European puppetry and exhilarating Taiwanese and Indonesian percussion, it tells the Malay fable of a mouse-deer who tricks a crocodile to help it cross a river.
It's genuinely jaw-dropping and, like so many other works at APT, it's absolutely worth looking at.

Late change of venue saves Rabbits Eat Lettuce music festival,By Peter Sanders,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-21/rabbits-eat-lettuce-venue-change-south-burnett/105081092,"The Rabbits Eat Lettuce music festival has found a new venue just weeks out from the event after being denied access to its previous location on Queensland's Southern Downs.
The five-day Easter event will move to Crystal Springs, a campground at Stonelands, about 130 kilometres west of Gympie.
The South Burnett Regional Council granted organisers a temporary event permit on Thursday.
Last year, Rabbits Eat Lettuce became the first festival in Queensland to run pill testing after Ebony Greening and Dassarn Tarbutt died from suspected overdoses in a tent at the 2019 event.
The future of the festival had been in doubt since February after the Southern Downs Regional Council refused organiser REL Events' development application and temporary permits for the previous site, Cherrabah Resort, about 200km south west of Brisbane, near Warwick.

REL Events director Erik Lamir said he was relieved to find a new location, with about 5,000 people expected to attend the event from April 17 to 21.
""It's still going to be the same spectacular show that we always produce all stages and artists are still coming across to the new venue,"" he said.
Mr Lamir said pill testing at the event would be operated by Pill Testing Australia this year.
Rabbits Eat Lettuce was the first festival in Queensland to offer pill testing last year. (Facebook: Rabbits Eat Lettuce festival)
""We saw a huge reduction in drug related medical presentations to our medical facility [last year], and it also resulted in zero ambulance transfers,"" he said.
Mr Lamir said tickets would not be refunded for people who could no longer attend the new location.
In February, the Southern Downs Regional Council refused a development application from REL Events Pty Ltd to host up to 10,000 people at Cherrabah Resort over 12 days per year.
It would have allowed the company to hold multiple events at the site at different times in the year.

Southern Downs Regional Council documents showed REL Event's development application was refused for several reasons including environmental impact, sound, land conflict, and safety issues.
Mr Lamir said his company planned to appeal the decision in the Planning and Environment Court so the event could return to its original site in the future.
""We ran a very successful, squeaky clean event last year,"" he said.
""We were expecting an approval, and then when it got to the council meeting, it turned into a political issue, and it was voted down.
""We have a very strong case with the Planning and Environment Court, I'm confident in our case.""
REL Events had also applied for two temporary entertainment event permits at Cherrabah Resort and nearby Thanes Creek, but Mr Lamir said the council also rejected those applications.
The council declined to comment on the development application and the temporary entertainment event permits.
South Burnett Regional Council said it could not find any reason not to approve the event at Stonelands this year.
Mayor Kathy Duff said REL Events ticked all the boxes for compliance with the council's planning department.
""I have had a brief conversation with Erik [Lamir], and I've spoken to our planners at length, and they said that they've put in a lot of regulations,"" she said.
Kathy Duff says it remains to be seen if the council will consider holding a second event. (ABC Southern QLD: Peter Sanders)

""It's an opportunity to for our region to have an economic boost, particularly to that area [of the region] … I'm hoping that they get some economic benefits.""
Councillor Duff said she supported pill testing to continue at the festival.
""I'm hoping that everyone is safe, and that the and that there's no incidences, and that it's just a great event for our region,"" she said.",ABC News,music
Donatella Versace steps down as creative director after almost three decades,Elissa Steedman,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-14/donatella-versace-steps-down-as-prada-circles/105051048,"Haute couture stalwart Donatella Versace has been replaced as creative director of the luxury fashion house Versace.
She will be replaced by Dario Vitale, who most recently was design director at Miu Miu, with his appointment effective on April 1.
It marks the first time in the brand's 47-year history that it will be led by someone without the Versace surname.
Versace welcomed Vitale to the role, emphasising in a statement that ""championing the next generation of designers has always been important to me"".
""I am thrilled that Dario Vitale will be joining us, and excited to see Versace through new eyes,"" she said.
""I want to thank my incredible design team and all the employees at Versace that I have had the privilege of working with for over three decades.""
The matriarch said she would take on a new role as chief brand ambassador and ""will remain Versace's most passionate supporter"".

The creative shift comes amid speculation that Prada Group is in talks to buy Versace from Capri Holdings, which paid 2 billion euros for the fashion house in 2018.
The US group also owns Michael Kors and Jimmy Choo.
Miuccia Prada — the head of Prada Group — acknowledged interest in the brand on the sidelines of Milan Fashion Week last month, while Versace made no comment at what was to be her last runway show.
Versace symbolically wore a vintage jacket that Gianni made for her in 1992, inspired by the powerful Miss S&M collection.
Capri Holding's statement made no mention of any plans to sell Versace, but the arrival of a designer from Miu Miu — a brand also owned by Prada Group — is only likely to fuel speculation of a possible deal.
Versace was thrust into the role of creative director in 1997 after her brother Gianni Versace's murder in Miami.
""It has been the greatest honour of my life to carry on my brother Gianni's legacy,"" she said.
""He was the true genius, but I hope I have some of his spirit and tenacity.""
As the fashion house lead, she brought a boldness that led to some iconic runway and red carpet moments.

On the 20th anniversary of Gianni's death, Donatella created a healing tribute that featured supermodels he helped elevate.
Under Donatella, Versace became synonymous with the power woman she herself projected, despite periods of self-doubt.
""I asked why I took so long to find my way,"" she told reporters ahead of the anniversary show.
""The first few years I wasn't sure of myself. I made mistakes. But you learn from your mistakes.""

Versace received an outpouring of love and support on social media from younger designers she championed over the years, including Roberto Cavalli creative director Fausto Puglisi and former Valentino designer Pierpaolo Piccioli.
""I hope I've made you proud so far,"" Versace wrote in a post celebrating her and Gianni's creations and moments from across Versace's nearly 50 years.
Versace CEO John D Idol said in a statement the creative shift was ""part of a thoughtful succession plan for Versace"".
He called Vitale a ""strong leader"", and expressed confidence that ""his talent and vision will be instrumental to Versace's future growth"".
As chief brand ambassador, Versace ""will continue to champion the Versace brand and its values"", Idol said.
Versace represented 20 per cent of Capri Holdings with 2024 revenue of 5.2 billion euros.
Capri recently laid out strategic plans to rebalance the Versace portfolio to return the brand to its more daring roots, increase sales of accessories and win back entry-level consumers put off by a post-pandemic focus on higher net-worth clients.
During the presentation, Idol acknowledged that Versace had recently struggled in menswear ""where the historical … customer was used to us being very, very loud. And we've gone much quieter.""
Versace's loud designs will be a departure from the preppy Miu Miu style Vitale has worked with for more than a decade.  (Reuters: Stephane Mahe)
Coming across from Miu Miu, where he has worked since 2010, Vitale will be tasked with appealing to a new customer base.
""Versace and Miu Miu are very different brands and have very different customers,"" said Federico Giglio, chief executive of Giglio.com, an Italy-based retailer.
The Miu Miu customer likes more detail, a classy look, while remaining playful, whereas the Versace woman has a brasher and sexy style, he added.
""A good designer, however, knows how to identify with the DNA of the company and add his personal touch,"" he said.

The Buddha of Suburbia author Hanif Kureishi broke his neck in 2022 — but he's writing more than ever,Nicola Heath,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-02-19/hanif-kureishi-the-buddha-of-suburbia-book/104926454,"British writer Hanif Kureishi had just opened a beer and sat down to watch football on TV when he suddenly blacked out.
It was 2022, and he was at the Rome apartment of his partner, Isabella d'Amico.
""I don't really know what happened next, but I think I stood up, and then I just fell flat on my face — bang — and I broke my neck,"" he tells Radio National's The Book Show.
Your favourite fiction authors share the story behind their latest books.
Kureishi survived the accident but sustained a serious spinal injury, which resulted in tetraplegia.
When he woke up in hospital, he was unable to use his arms and legs.
""But I can still talk, so when I came out of my unconsciousness, I began to write,"" he says.
""I began to dictate these blogs to Isabella, who would sit next to me on the bed, typing this stuff furiously into her phone.""
Published on social media, Kureishi's posts struck a chord with his followers.
""It was a very strange period, when I was so ill and so isolated and so lost in depression and self pity,"" he says. ""But at the same time, this huge audience started to respond to what I was writing.""
He wrote this way every day, and his three sons soon stepped in to help.
These daily dispatches form the basis of Kureishi's 2024 memoir, Shattered, a diarised account of his accident and ongoing recovery.
The ability to write — to document his experience and connect with his audience — has formed an integral part of his recovery.
""Luckily — despite the fact that I am injured — I can still write, I can do my job and, in fact, I'm probably doing it better now than I have done for a long time,"" he says.
It's the latest chapter in a life of writing that began with the Oscar-nominated screenplay for the 1985 film My Beautiful Laundrette, directed by Stephen Frears and starring Daniel Day-Lewis, about a gay Pakistani British boy growing up in London in the 1980s.
But the book that made Kureishi a literary star was his debut novel, The Buddha of Suburbia, published in 1990.
He joined The Book Show to discuss the story behind his much-loved novel.
The Buddha of Suburbia begins: ""My name is Karim Amir, and I am an Englishman born and bred, almost."" (Supplied: Faber)
Based on Kureishi's life growing up in South London, The Buddha of Suburbia is a portrait of race, sex, class and music in London in the 70s, told from the perspective of 17-year-old Karim.
The novel became an international bestseller, winning the Whitbread Award for best first book. David Bowie — who went to the same school as Kureishi — composed the music for the 1993 BBC adaptation.
Three decades later, The Buddha of Suburbia — adapted for the stage by Kureishi and UK director Emma Rice in 2024 — is still attracting readers.
""People tell me that they read it, they enjoyed it, they laughed at it, and it meant something to them, and that really cheers me up,"" Kureishi says.
Kureishi wrote The Buddha of Suburbia at a moment when London's literary scene was flourishing.
He'd become friends with Salman Rushdie, who had won the Booker Prize in 1982 for Midnight's Children and was known for throwing great parties.
""He was this incredible figure in London at the time. He was so smart, a great raconteur. He'd read everything, seen all the movies [and] talked continuously,"" Kureishi recalls.

Kureishi found himself mixing with the likes of Martin Amis, Julian Barnes, Kazuo Ishiguro and Jeanette Winterson, who were part of a ""huge explosion of English writing"" making waves around the world.
The ambitious Kureishi aspired to join their ranks.
He says he wanted to break new ground by writing about race in the UK in a way that hadn't been done before.
""[I felt] if I don't do this, I'm going to be left behind, and I want to keep up with these people. I wanted to write something original, like Salman was doing.""
The ""Buddha"" of the title is Karim's father, Haroon, styled after Kureishi's father, who emigrated to England in the 1940s to study law.
But instead of gaining a degree and returning home to Pakistan as was expected, Kureishi's father followed his own path, dropping out of university, marrying a white English woman and starting a family.
In the novel, Haroon — like Kureishi's father in real life — develops an interest in Eastern philosophy and soon becomes a popular guru-type figure in the neighbourhood.
Karim finds his father embarrassing but others are drawn to Haroon's brand of mysticism, tapping into an interest in Indian spirituality popularised by the Beatles, who made a famous trip to an Indian ashram in 1968.

At the same time, however, the UK was witnessing an ugly upswing in racist attacks on South Asian people.
""We were chased around the streets by skinheads. We were terrified of being beaten up and abused. You had to really be careful in South London at that time,"" Kureishi recalls.
Navigating this charged political atmosphere as a mixed-race kid was challenging.
""On the one hand, you were this kind of scum who was always being pursued by white nationalists,"" Kureishi says.
""On the other hand, you then became this font of wisdom for talking about anti-materialism and meditation.""
Kureishi says his father, pleased to be the subject of a novel, would sit in the front row at readings and tell people he was the Buddha of suburbia.
""He was proud of me because he wanted to be a writer himself.""
While the novel is semi-autobiographical, it's not completely true to life.
""I took out the boring bits and left in the sex and drugs and rock and roll,"" Kureishi says.
""Karim has a really good time. He seduces people, he goes to orgies, he takes drugs, goes to rock and roll concerts, and then he becomes an actor. He has lots of adventures.""
Novels by Sally Rooney, Tim Winton and Booker Prize winner Samantha Harvey top our critics' favourite reads of the year.
But the reality was more sedate, he says.
In the 70s, London was humming with creativity, but it all felt very distant from the dreary conformity of life in the suburbs.
""You lay in your room listening to the radio, knowing the people in London were having a great time while you were trying to do your homework.""
In the tradition of other famous teenage narrators, such as The Catcher in the Rye's Holden Caulfield, Karim's adolescent perspective offers a critique of the adult society around him.
""When you're that age, everything adults do is completely f**king idiotic,"" Kureishi says.",ABC News,music
Home and Away star Lynne McGranger bows out after 33 years,DBy Daniela Pizzirani,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-02-24/home-and-away-star-lynne-mcgranger-exits-after-33-years/104973054,"Home and Away has announced it will say goodbye to legacy character Irene Roberts, played by Lynne McGranger, after 33 years on the show.
The actor, 72, said she is leaving the Australian show in March, with her character set to exit screens in the middle of this year.
The Logie-nominated star, who had previously broken the news to her fellow cast members on set, will step back from the show as she sets off on another nationwide theatre tour of The Grandparents Club.
The cast of The Grandparents Club with Lynne McGranger will tour from July to October this year.
""After almost 33 years in my dream role and working everyday with people who I love, respect and whom I now consider family, it's bittersweet to be closing the chapter on what has been the best and longest gig of my life,"" McGranger said in a statement.
How the character Irene, who has beaten breast cancer, alcoholism and a plane crash, will depart the show is uncertain.
The star revealed she has been involved in the storyline behind the iconic character's exit, but did not say how she will leave Summer Bay.
""I can say that I came up with the idea,"" she told Channel Seven.
""It is very pertinent and it's very current, and I think the viewers won't be disappointed.""

"Parental Guidance showcases distinct parenting styles and, it turns out, a new way of life",Adults live with parents,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-15/parental-guidance-parenting-styles-way-of-life/105052328,"In no imaginable universe would I ever put myself forward for a reality TV show.
OK, maybe Gogglebox, but that's only because, like most Australians, I fancy that I'm an undiscovered stand-up comedian and also because it's a job I could do sitting on the couch eating crisps. I was born for that.
But certainly, none of the rest of them and especially not the one show that my son has positively nagged us to go on: the infrequently broadcast gladiatorial parenting show, Parental Guidance, in which families with self-described distinct parenting styles battle each other to be recognised as best practice.
There's the authoritarian, the free range, the spiritual and the ""team"" styles, among many others. They all have their eyebrow raising eccentricities and their advantages. But the one thing they all have in common is that parenting and being devoted to their children — even the free range ones — is the centre of their lives.
Not for them the family life of my generation: harried parents who kicked you out of the house after breakfast and didn't expect to see you 'til dinner, and who would be speechless if you looked to them to not only feed and house you, but also advise, entertain, comfort and ""snowplough"" for you.
This approach to child rearing lands as indulgent, disabling and preposterous to parents from a time when reproduction was just that — making more humans until they left home and made more humans themselves. Such parenting is blamed for pampered young adults who ""fail to launch"" and many apparently less independent young adults.
So this is where new surveys by the Pew Research Centre in the US land with an unexpectedly happy thud, showing that yes, many parents are highly involved in their young adult children's lives but the clear majority of them, and their children, are very happy about it.
Further, the surveys show that these kids are nonetheless achieving certain milestones of independence even while they remain closely connected to their parents.
A cluster of interdependent changes have aided the shift: tech and telephony advancements that make staying in touch cheaper and easier; changing gender roles and expectations that have seen more fathers taking on (some) greater caregiving responsibilities; and the major social change of the abandonment of authoritarianism as the prevailing parental style.
Adult children who live at home share the pros and cons of living with parents.
Not that every parent wants to be a best friend, but I'd wager that very few wield the straps that were common in my generation's households.
Child rearing is now an entire way of life. It's a choice and an embrace of making a highly connected life with the humans you create because, if it works, it brings mutual joy and closeness. It's the same reason why many people are very reasonably opting not to have children: it's not just because of the cost, it's because the expectation is now of a continuing close and committed life experience that isn't for everyone.
Now, you don't have to yell — I can hear your groans from here, accusing modern parenting of creating a generation that lacks grit or life skills. And yes, I've also seen the less healthy side of parental over-involvement that rivals even the Boomers in its desperate desire to be seen as persistently youthful.
But it is sneaky sophistry to argue this and airily ignore the economic realities that underpin this complete change in parenting. I could — and did — run out the door with my sister at the age of 19, with zero money in the bank but three casual shifts at Woolworths in my diary — and make a go of it.
Somewhere deep inside, my angry parents knew that too: my sister and I would be able to ask the world to provide for us if we offered the fair exchange of our labour.
But that was at a time when mortgage — or rent — requirements sat at about 30 per cent of my income, and I was on a pauper's wage: a full-time university student supporting myself on three five-hour shifts.
In the early '60s, household debt-to-income ratios were around 20 per cent; they crept up a little for me in the '80s: now they sit at around 190 per cent — that's an increase of 850 per cent over my lifetime. With all other costs hurtling skyward as well.
And while Australia never broadcast the classic New York city television PSA asking if you knew where your kids were at 10pm, that would have been a reasonable question in my youth. Maybe I was in bed; or maybe I'd crammed myself into a friend's brother's Torana and we were hightailing it to the Crystal Ballroom in St Kilda to try to sneak past security. We were 16.
The shadow cast by that sort of history provides the other, more heartening side of the discussion, which is: What's the point of doing this at all if you don't really do it?
The Pew research records parents noting that they like their kids, that they are fun to be with. The kids said they value the advice and life experience their parents share with them.
One in three Australian grandparents babysit their grandkids to fill in gaps in childcare, becoming a support ""village"" for working parents, research finds. But what happens if you don't have grandparents to rely on?
Oddly, all of this sounds more like a much older, pre-Boomer way of growing up, when generations shared houses and helped each other grow up.
But you can never quite escape your own past. There's a part of me that cringes when I hear dads describe their grown sons as their ""best mate"" and the enmeshed mother/daughter relationship can truly be one of the most toxic. But then, that's what a kid from the ""do you know where your children are"" generation would say, isn't it?
If the alternative is a staunch and loving parent who is always in your corner and always up for a coffee, a yoga session and a bit of advice, it's hard to see the downside.
This weekend we have a delightful selection of long reads for you, including from our very own Mary McGillivray on the remarkable connection between Australia — and the enduring gifts of the Felton Bequest — and the masterpiece tapestry, The Lady and the Unicorn.
Have a safe and happy weekend and as I cast around with a little envy at all the marvellous acts music festival-starved music festival goers have been able to fall into, I find myself pulling out the CDs (oh yes, still CDs) of the acts I wish I had the time to see myself. I hear PJ was epic. When is she never? Enjoy this and go well.

Anaïs Mitchell proves dreamers have power in Hadestown musical starring Christine Anu,Rudi Bremer,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-22/hadestown-broadway-musical-anais-mitchell-christine-anu/105074366,"When US singer-songwriter Anaïs Mitchell was driving home to Vermont one night in 2006, a melody and some words popped into her head: ""Wait for me. I'm comin' in my garters and pearls. With what melody did you barter me, from the wicked Underworld?""
It seemed to be about Orpheus and Eurydice from Greek mythology.
The story of the man who breaks a rule set by Hades, god of the underworld, not to look at his lover, who in turn disappears, had been a favourite of Mitchell's growing up. She was drawn to it by a sense of kinship with the young lovers.
""They just always captured my imagination … the idea of this young artist, dreamer, lover that believes he could change the way the world is. And he comes up against the reality of the way the world is. I think in my early 20s that was me,"" she says.
""The character that I most identify with now is Hermes; this storyteller, who at some level sits outside of the story, but you can tell that his heart is in there,"" Mitchell says. (Supplied: Jay Sansone)
From Mitchell's snippet of a song, she started to work on a show that would eventually become the Tony Award-winning Broadway musical, Hadestown, a folk-opera retelling of two love stories told by god of travellers Hermes.
In it, Orpheus travels to Hadestown to rescue his love, Eurydice, and lead her home. Running parallel to that is the love story of the gods Hades and queen of the underworld Persephone, who've been together for all of time and are trying to figure out if there's a redemption for them.
Christine Anu is set to lead the cast of the Broadway smash-hit musical Hadestown.
Mitchell finds a certain comfort in the story about a dreamer challenging a power far bigger than themselves.
""The most moving thing about Orpheus [is] he's a hero, not because he succeeds and wins, but because he tries,"" she says.
""There's a sense that, just like spring coming around, young people are always going to be coming up, seeing how things could be, doing their best to change it.""
Although Mitchell was working on her third album, The Brightness (2007), she couldn't stop thinking about the epic love story that seemed to have dropped into her car that night.
Abigail Adriano and Noah Mullins, who play characters Eurydice and Orpheus, bring the epic journey of love, hope and sacrifice to life. (Supplied)
Together with collaborators, including Michael Chorney and Todd Sickafoose, she started to develop a ""DIY community theatre version"" of Hadestown.
""Those guys come from jazz and a much more expansive big band/art rock sound and all of those influences are in the music,"" Mitchell says. ""Michael from the earliest days, put the trombone in there, and it suddenly felt very New Orleans-y.""
For a few years she and her team continued to write songs and refine the show. They even made a studio record featuring Ani DiFranco.
But it wasn't until Mitchell moved to New York City that she could fully develop the show for the stage.
It's there that she met Rachel Chavkin (Natasha, Pierre & The Great Comet of 1812), who became Hadestown's director throughout the show's off-Broadway, Canada and London runs, and then, in 2019, its Broadway run.
""It's so funny because it was never the goal to take it to Broadway. It was really one foot in front of the next … It's beyond my wildest dreams that we ever made it to Broadway and that it could have a life of its own in the world,"" Mitchell says.
The musical has now won eight Tony Awards, including Best Musical, and the Grammy Award (2020) for Best Musical Theatre Album. (Supplied)
Still for all the ""effort and sweat and tears"" that went into Hadestown, she can't help but feel like it was a show that already existed.
""[It's] almost like we were excavating a thing out of the ground or, like the idea of a sculpture in the stone, that it's already in there, and you're just chipping, chipping, chipping away.
""So there's a way in which, when it went out into the world, it kind of felt like it was never mine. It was never ours anyway. It just always existed,"" she explains.
Hadestown is a sturdy enough show that it can be — and has been — transplanted onto new stages with new creative teams.
""I love to imagine how Australian people are going to receive it and also how that company is going to make it their own and bring their lived and felt experience into those roles and see how it resonates,"" Mitchell says.
In order to find the right people to bring an Australian stamp to Hadestown, open call auditions were held in Sydney and Melbourne in June 2024.
It led to newcomers Eliza Soriano and Joshua Kobeck being cast alongside seasoned performers like Noah Mullins (West Side Story, RENT), Abigail Adriano (Matilda the Musical, Miss Saigon), and multi-ARIA Award winner Christine Anu.
""I've never felt so addicted to music in a show before,"" Anu told the ABC. (Supplied)
Auditions were a democratic process, echoing Mitchell's experiences in the folk music world.
""It's not like you need to be discovered by some corporate boys in the back room … It's sort of like there's an open door and you go through it and you're like: 'Here's my songs. I'll play for whoever I can,'"" she says.
That open door also allows for a greater level of diversity — an important part of Hadestown since the beginning.
""Certainly [diversity] is an ethos of Rachel's as a director … It feels very mythic to reflect the breadth of who we are as humans in the telling of this mythic story, so that it truly can feel like it's everyone's story,"" Mitchell says.
So, while André De Shields originally played the role of Hermes on Broadway, Anu is playing the god of travellers here in Australia.
The shift in gender means that, rather than being addressed as ""brother"", Anu's Hermes is ""sister"". But this isn't the first time the gendered language of the show has been adapted.
""We had a Hermes in London who preferred to play the role kind of ungendered or non-binary and so I rewrote some language so that that exists … The world is changing and, ideally, the show can change with it,"" she explains.
""I fully relate to her, every shade of her,"" Rokobaro told Theatre Royal Sydney about her character, Persephone. (Supplied)
Over the course of the almost 20 years since Mitchell first began developing Hadestown, she's seen the themes in the work shift from rhetoric to reality and back again more than once.
In the first act, Hades and his workers sing about building a wall ""to keep [them] free"".
""I wrote that [song] in 2006 and it definitely predated 2016, when then, our current president was campaigning for his first election and literally the same words [were] coming out of his mouth in a call-and-response fashion with his crowds, which was very chilling,"" Mitchell says.
""Part of our history is protests and people in the streets and unionisation and collective organising, stuff like that. And then there also is another part of our history that is like compulsive capitalism, industrialism and ultimately fascism, which is a word that I feel like I used to throw around in a light way,"" Mitchell says.
""And it doesn't feel so light anymore.""
Hadestown is on until April 29 in Sydney at Theatre Royal, then shows at Her Majesty's Theatre in Melbourne from May 8, 2025.",ABC News,music
Mosaic headstones help people work through grief for lost loved ones,By Oliver Brown,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-16/mosaic-headstones-help-people-work-through-grief/105048238,"On a dry, 34 degree Celsius day at a cemetery in remote New South Wales, Monica Kerwin gazes down at a grave site she hoped to never see with her own eyes.
The 55-year-old Barkandji woman from Wilcannia faced the unthinkable when she lost her son to suicide three years ago.
Although Ms Kerwin's parents, grandparents, siblings and uncles are all interred at the cemetery, she said this loss was so much worse.
""[Accepting] it is so hard … I'm still not to that stage, and I don't think anyone [is] ready to accept that someone you love so much is gone.""
Ms Kerwin says accepting the loss of her son has been very difficult. (ABC Broken Hill: Oliver Brown)
Ms Kerwin's grieving process has been different from most.
She is using her own two hands and lots and lots of broken tiles to make sure her son's cheeky smile and passion for rugby league are never forgotten.
Ms Kerwin is a founding member of Paaka Thartu Karnu, a grassroots community project that teaches Aboriginal people the art of mosaic so they can create personalised and affordable headstones for deceased loved ones, some of whom never had one previously.
Instructions: Use left and right arrow keys to control image transition
Established in 2018, the program has been on hold for the last few years, after Ms Kerwin and fellow founder Kelvin Thornycroft both lost close family members.
But Ms Kerwin said using her own program to manage her grief has, over time, spurred her to bring back a service she knew had helped so many people.
""It's special because you're taking a tile, something that's already been created, then you're smashing into 20 pieces to put it back together,"" she said.
An estimated 40 to 50 mosaic headstones have been created and installed at the Wilcannia cemetery. (ABC Broken Hill: Oliver Brown)
Since its inception over six years ago, dozens of colourful gravestones now decorate the Wilcannia cemetery.
""I love going to the cemetery [and] to look at all these mosaic headstones people have made in the past few years, they look really great, [it] brightens the cemetery up,"" local Barkandji man Steven Harris said.
While Mr Thornycroft is not returning to the project in a full capacity, Ms Kerwin has his full support as the sole operator.
Barkandji man Steven Harris says the project has helped him through his own grief. (ABC Broken Hill: Oliver Brown)
Mr Harris, who created headstones for his parents through the original 10-week workshops, said he was also enthusiastic to see it return.
""Doing a headstone makes you feel really, really proud … I didn't want to leave it,"" Mr Harris said.
""I've [since] done a few more besides my own [and] if they do ever start up again, I'd jump in and [be] quite happy to help.""
Gregory Phillips is a big supporter of programs with a focus on mental health outcomes.  (Supplied: Gregory Phillips)
Gregory Phillips, an adjunct professor in First Peoples health at Griffith University's School of Medicine, is also an admirer of how the project benefits local Indigenous mental health outcomes, particularly around death.
""Colonisation has meant we're dying at far higher and younger rates than the general population, so the amount of funerals generally for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people is much higher,"" the Waanyi and Jaru man said.
""Any ways that communities can deal with grief and do that in a ceremonial or positive way just helps with healing and recovery.""
In addition to resuming the project in Wilcannia, Ms Kerwin dreams to take it further, through installing cement slabs alongside the headstones, as well as sharing it with other Aboriginal communities.
While there was a positive response when she and Mr Thornycroft presented it to small groups in Menindee and Kempsey before the pandemic, she said financial support was needed to make it a reality.

Dr Phillips said he saw Paaka Thartu Karnu having the potential to go nationwide, but it would ultimately come down to finding the right partner.
""One of the risks in government funding is they want to take over and own it,"" he said.
""So if the community could find a way where they work with government or philanthropic or corporate partners to make sure it stays a community based [and] run program, I think that would be its strength.""",ABC News,music
"The truth behind Adolescence, the new Netflix series exploring incels and Andrew-Tate-style misogyny",Rachel Rasker,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-20/adolescence-netflix-manosphere-incel-jamie-crime/105066666,"Could a teenage boy be so influenced by the likes of misogynist Andrew Tate that he's driven to murder his young classmate?
This is the question at the centre of Adolescence, the gripping new Netflix crime drama.
In four episodes, each told through one continuous shot, the ramifications of 13-year-old Jamie's arrest is played out in spectacular style.
First-time actor Owen Cooper, who was just 14 at the time of his performance, compellingly leads in a series that takes toxic masculinity, loneliness and the gender divide to its extreme.
Adolescence explores the dark ideas influencing vulnerable young men online. (Netflix)
The show questions ""what can happen to a boy who's rejected by traditional masculinity"", explains Ryder Jack, the principal facilitator at Tomorrow Man, a social enterprise helping young people break down harmful gender stereotypes.
""Where does he go? What happens to [someone] craving affection and validation, [who] is so isolated?""
Spoilers for Adolescence ahead.
In Adolescence, Jamie attempts to balance the traditional gender expectations of his father's generation with the modern messaging presented to him online.
""[Teens today] have grown up through cancel culture, through the pandemic, and then now they're in this time of polarity where there's the 'woke left' and the 'extreme right',"" Mr Jack says.
It can leave teens scared of being ""cancelled"" or of saying the wrong thing.
""We're seeing boys retreat online, [where they] have all the freedom in the world … to push the boundaries, [to] outdo each other and shock each other.""
And it's in the online world where the 'manosphere', an umbrella term for overlapping misogynistic communities, runs rampant.
One idea presented by the manosphere is the 80-20 rule, a myth one teen in Adolescence presents as fact, explaining ""80 per cent of women are attracted to 20 per cent of men. You must trick them, because you'll never get them in a normal way"".
A teenage boy believing he needs to hoodwink girls into sex is not new.
Films like Superbad (2007) and American Pie (1999) focus on young men so desperate to lose their virginity they'll do absolutely anything to make it happen.
But Mr Jack says today's young people are bombarded with these messages on their phones and laptops 24 hours a day — and we're yet to see the full impact.
Mr Jack says manosphere influencers sell young men ""a quick fix"" to complexities like forming healthy relationships. (Netflix)
Initial effects are already playing out in schools, with Mr Jack hearing of ""boys trying to embarrass"" their female teachers, which is reflected in Adolescence too.
Jamie negs his female psychologist with mimicry, backhanded compliments and degrading name-calling in an attempt to gain control and power over her.
""You can see how he's using whatever he's been taught [online] to try to control the situation,"" Mr Jack says.
Key to the tension in Adolescence is the increasing polarisation between genders.
We learn that Katie, who Jamie is accused of stabbing, began a cyberbullying campaign against him, branding him an 'incel'.
An incel is an involuntary celibate — a community of men frustrated by their lack of success with women. They blame women for this perceived failure.
Online misogyny impacts girls and women in schools in real life and in the show. (Netflix)
In the show, the term ""incel"" is used as an insult and a joke, and it's a term Jamie consistently rejects.
Mr Jack says in his workshops with young people, teenage boys also tend to be evasive about the beliefs they hold towards women.
Tomorrow Man's partner organisation, Tomorrow Woman, runs workshops with girls, with the genders initially separated before being brought together for later discussion.
""The girls will talk about the boys a lot and how they're impacted by them … [whereas] we have to be strategic and encourage [the boys].""
Mr Jack stresses that it's not everyone — only ""a very small pocket"" of teenage boys are incels. (Netflix)
There are other things the show gets right, Mr Jack says.
In Adolescence, Jamie is bewildered at the idea of men having platonic friendships with women, and boys and girls at his school are split into 'us' and 'them'.
From Mr Jack's observations, ""Girls are fired up, like they should be … and for boys, they feel under attack. They get defensive … there's a real divide.""
He says bringing girls and boys together for open discussions about their experiences with gender stereotypes can be ""really powerful"".
It's healthy for kids to be curious about things like the manosphere, experts say, but parents need to help them navigate the harmful messages it promotes.
Mr Jack says Adolescence carries a powerful lesson in the importance of prioritising your relationship with your teenager.
His advice to parents and carers is to download and become familiar with the apps and sites teens are on, so they feel a little less ""foreign [and] scary"", and he suggests checking out the federal government's algorithm of disrespect resource.
If rules are put in place about no phones in bedrooms or after lights-out, he'd recommend leading by example, and following these same boundaries.
He suggests being curious rather than reactive — making a huge deal out of something may simply cause defensiveness, and could stop teens from coming to an adult again.
""If [your child] says something toxic or that he's heard from the manosphere, rather than biting his head off, go: 'Wow, that's a pretty interesting thing to say. What do you mean by that?'""
While Mr Jack wouldn't necessarily recommend teens watching Adolescence as a life-lesson, it could lead to positive discussions at home.
He recommends parents approach it with a comment along the lines of, ""Hey, I heard about this show. I'd love to watch it and discuss it with you and hear your thoughts.""",ABC News,music
Severance's Gemma — Australia's Dichen Lachman — takes us behind the scenes ahead of the season two finale,Rachel Rasker,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-21/severance-gemma-lumon-explained-cold-harbor/105075584,"This season of sci-fi thriller Severance, fans have demonstrated their commitment to Lumon Industries like never before.
Social media has become overrun with convoluted theories about the fictional corporation. We've seen costume parties featuring Severance-themed food and matching lanyards. There have been endless memes and TikToks following each episode's release.
And Apple TV+ has leaned in, with a promotion campaign on another floor entirely.
Since its iconic pop-up office at New York’s Grand Central station, the streamer has released a series of unnerving Lumon training videos (including on LinkedIn), an eight-hour focus mix aptly titled Music To Refine To, and even made Ricken's infamous self-help book, The You You Are, available as both an e-book and an audiobook.
The hype is all due to come to a head today, as the 76-minute season finale, Cold Harbor, finally hits our screens.
If all goes well (and it probably won't), Mark will finally reunite with his wife Gemma, played by Australian actress Dichen Lachman, who grew up in Adelaide.
Lachman sat down with Jason Di Rosso on ABC Radio National's The Screen Show to unpack the cult that is Severance.
Severance (pre-finale) spoilers ahead.
Before Severance became the record-breaking hit we know it as today, Lachman explains that the show's creator, Dan Erickson, had never set foot on a TV set.
The aspiring writer dreamed up the idea while enduring his own soul-crushing office job cataloguing door parts on a computer, wishing he could simply fast forward to the end of the day.
Will Mark and Gemma reunite in Severance's season finale? (Apple TV+)
""I don't think, from my conversations with [Erickson], that when developing this in the door factory … he envisioned it exactly the way it is now,"" Lachman says, crediting Erickson's collaboration with Ben Stiller as key to the show's success.
Initially, severance was introduced as a procedure to separate someone's memories between their work and home self, creating an 'innie' version of them at work, and an 'outie' in their personal life.
This season, the concept was expanded from a simple corporate tool to a fully fledged product, allowing those who've gone through the procedure to avoid everything from writing Christmas cards to going to the dentist.
Meanwhile, there's a part of their consciousness that's forced to sit through endless cavity fillings.
One part of Gemma's consciousness lives in a reality where she writes Christmas cards all day, every day. (Apple TV+)
For Lachman, the show's creative spin on the sci-fi genre helps it hold an ""extraordinary mirror"" to our society.
""We're always trying to shut things off that are unpleasant, or numb ourselves.
""I would never personally choose to go through the severance procedure [because] I feel like, as painful as some things are in life, you have to have that contrast to really experience the joys.""
Outside of Lumon's commercial interests, there's a religiosity that dominates much of Severance's world.
Patricia Arquette's Harmony Cobel seems particularly drawn to the cult of Kier, while the show's innies treat Ricken's self-help book like a Bible.
In the season one finale, Mark discovers wellness adviser Ms Casey is actually his wife, Gemma. (Apple TV+)
""As humans … we have a tendency to want to create these myths and stories,"" Lachman muses.
Jason Di Rosso interviews the makers of the movies and TV you need to see.
""Inside Lumon, it's like they're building a completely different construct for these [innies] … because essentially, they don't understand anything of what's happening in the outside world.""
Lachman feels this isn't so different from the constructs we've created in our own reality.
""Like, I don't know, the stock market, or just the fact that we wake up every day, we get in our cars and we go to work, there's a belief system [in that].
""Sometimes, I think, 'Why am I doing this? This seems completely pointless,' but it's just a part of what you do because that's what we've been doing for hundreds of years.""
Key to this season's expansion is Lachman's pivotal episode, Chikhai Bardo, where we discover just how far the procedure can go.
It's the first time we see Lachman as Mark's wife, Gemma, outside of still photos, having previously only been familiar with her innie, Ms Casey.
His grief over her loss forms the emotional heart of the show, and the love story of their early days plays out as flashbacks on film.
For Lachman, shooting on film also added a ""little bit more pressure"" to her performance because, while modern cameras never run out of storage, there's a time limit with film to get it right.
""With film, there is something finite about it, and it captured the light differently in such an organic way,"" she explains.
Ben Stiller was kept busy as the crew's second unit cinematographer in charge of their old Bolex camera.
""Between set-ups … Adam [Scott] and I would go outside with Ben and he'd be cranking up the Bolex, and it felt like what making an independent film feels like, it was really exciting.""",ABC News,music
"Daredevil: Born Again treads the same ground as its predecessor, and that's not a bad thing",By Christian Harimanow,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-19/daredevil-born-again-review/105065268,"As a series title, Daredevil: Born Again holds a double meaning. Disney+'s latest Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) show — about a blind lawyer who moonlights as a vigilante in Hell's Kitchen, NYC — draws its name from a seminal story arc of its comic book source material: 1986's Born Again by Frank Miller and David Mazzucchelli.
Except this series is not an adaptation of that storyline at all. Instead, the title refers to Daredevil being 'born again' into the MCU continuity.
It is essentially a revival or direct sequel (just don't call it a comeback) to Netflix's beloved and much-lauded Daredevil series, which ran for three seasons from 2015 before it was unceremoniously cancelled in 2018, despite the show's popularity.
The good news is the original cast is back. Charlie Cox returns as Daredevil (and daytime alter ego Matt Murdock) and Vincent D'Onofrio reprises his larger-than-life (pun intended) arch-nemesis, Wilson Fisk, AKA Kingpin. Also returning are Deborah Ann Woll and Elden Henson, who play sidekicks Karen Page and Franklin ""Foggy"" Nelson respectively, as well as Jon Bernthal as everyone's favourite psychopathic vigilante, The Punisher.
""[I remember] the excitement of sitting down with Charlie again, even with him playing this annoying character,"" D'Onofrio told Marvel. (Supplied: Disney+)
The even better news is this latest incarnation, after three episodes, is off to a solid start. Daredevil: Born Again wisely never strays too far from what made the original so good. It retains the earlier series' gritty style and crunchy, visceral, close-quarter action scenes. But the show is at its best when Cox and D'Onofrio are simply verbally sparring across a table.
It also inherits the Netflix show's uneven pacing. But if we could live with it before, we can live with it again, just to spend nine more episodes (at least) with The Devil of Hell's Kitchen.
Daredevil started life as a comic book in 1964. It follows the story of Matt Murdock, who becomes blind after his eyes are exposed to radioactive materials as a child but finds his other senses enhanced to superhuman levels.
Fast forward to adulthood and, following the death of his father at the hands of the mob (a superhero origin-story staple), Murdock has become a successful lawyer. But, secretly, he has also been trained by a blind ninja master named Stick. Combining these ninja skills with his superhuman senses, Murdock prowls the night as Daredevil, protecting Hell's Kitchen from organised crime and supervillains alike.
""It's so cool to be standing here today and feeling thrilled with the product, that we ended up in the place we wanted to be,"" Cox told The Hollywood Reporter. (Also pictured: Deborah Ann Woll and Elden Henson) (Supplied: Disney+)
Daredevil is essentially a street-level superhero. Yes, he has superpowers but he's no god of thunder (Thor), nor is he clad in a high-tech battle suit (Iron Man). His arch-nemesis, Kingpin, is a mob boss who controls Hell's Kitchen.
It's also a comic book steeped in Irish Catholic symbolism and lore. Daredevil often explores themes of guilt, the saviour complex and the pressures of always trying to be a good person. In that same vein, Daredevil storyline titles often feature religious references, such as End Of Days, Guardian Devil and, of course, Born Again.
In 2015, alongside more colourful, techy, high-concept franchises like The Avengers, X-Men and Spider-man, Netflix's Daredevil felt refreshingly grounded. It was pitched as a crime show with masks rather than a superhero show and pleased both casual viewers and fans of the comic books.
It was violent, yes, but that violence was purposeful. It had weight. Fights were consequential, in close quarters. After a fight, Daredevil would have blood on his knuckles. He'd need stitches and rest to recover. (Take a look at this to give you some idea.)
With the show's inarguable success came the inevitable flood of spin-offs that failed to match Daredevil's high bar.
Cox told SFX: ""Coming back after all these years, we don’t want to just do exactly the same thing."" (Also pictured: Deborah Ann Woll as Karen Page) (Supplied: Disney+)
And while Netflix never gave a definitive word as to why the show was cancelled, it was likely a combination of the streamer calculating that continuing Daredevil, an expensive show, would lead to diminishing returns, coupled with Disney announcing plans to launch their own streaming service and the company's (who owned Marvel) desire to bring its intellectual properties in-house.
Fans were understandably angry and feared the character might be gone forever or recast and reimagined by Marvel Studios. But, as it turns out, #SaveDaredevil groups wouldn't have to wait long after all.
Three years later, in 2021, Murdock, played by Charlie Cox, made a brief appearance in Spider-Man: No Way Home as Peter Parker's lawyer.
The character appeared again in Disney+ shows She-Hulk: Attorney at Law (2022) and Echo (2024).
""I never go into work that day thinking, 'Hey, I'm playing a bad guy,'"" D'Onofrio told USA Today. (Supplied: Disney+)
Daredevil: Born Again officially began development and shooting in 2022 but was then completely overhauled by 2023, with the initial directors replaced.
The show finally premiered on Disney+ on March 4, 2025.
While it's possible to follow Daredevil: Born Again without having seen the original series, it is basically the fourth season of the show.
The story picks up directly from the end of season 3, when Daredevil has once again seen off Kingpin, beating him to within an inch of his life. However, the finale leaves enough loose ends to set up the perfect jumping-off point for the new series.

US TV personality Wendy Williams says she's being denied her freedom,Rebecca Armitage,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-16/wendy-williams-guardianship-conservatorships/105046092,"It started with a piece of paper tossed from the fifth-floor window of a luxury assisted living facility in New York City.
The note read ""Help! Wendy!!,"" according to US media.
When police were called to conduct a welfare check, they took a 60-year-old woman living on the facility's memory ward to hospital.
That woman was Wendy Williams, a beloved TV personality in the US, whose long-running talk show once rivalled Ellen Degeneres for the top slot in the syndicated daytime ratings.
Three years ago, her life seemed to implode.
After a series of health issues and a very public divorce from her husband, Williams' show was cancelled in 2022.
Her bank accounts were frozen because Wells Fargo said she was ""incapacitated"" and a ""victim of undue influence and financial exploitation"".
The court appointed a lawyer to act as her guardian, overseeing her finances and welfare, and Williams' spokesperson later said the star had been diagnosed with progressive aphasia and frontotemporal dementia (FTD).
""Over the past few years, questions have been raised at times about Wendy's ability to process information, and many have speculated about Wendy's condition, particularly when she began to lose words, act erratically at times, and have difficulty understanding financial transactions,"" her team said.
Williams has been living in the care facility for almost three years, but after she was taken to a New York hospital this week, she was given a series of mental competency evaluations.
She then phoned up a local TV news station and told them she ""passed with flying colours"".
Her niece Alex Finnie has previously stated that her famous aunt is ""being denied her freedoms"".
""She is being held, and she is being punished, for whatever reason that other people are coming up with as to why she has to be kept in this position,"" she said.
The furore has reopened a debate in the US about whether the practice of legal guardianships — in some states, known as conservatorships — is rife with abuse.
Several female celebrities, including Britney Spears and Amanda Bynes have both been placed under conservatorships, and had to fight the courts to regain their legal and financial autonomy.
As the #FreeWendy movement gains momentum, her legal guardian says coverage of Williams' predicament is ""untrue, inaccurate, incomplete, or misleading"".
But Williams' loved ones say a system designed to protect vulnerable people is being used to deny an adult woman her freedom.
The Wendy Williams Show, with all its chaos and messy gossip segments, had legions of fans for its 14-year run in the US.
At its peak, it was averaging more than 1.6 million viewers an episode, many of them young women.
And while it wasn't broadcast in Australia, you'll probably recognise Williams anyway, because she was eminently meme-able.
Ever heard the trending audio: ""she's an icon, she's a legend, and she is the moment""? That was Williams talking about rapper Lil Kim.
Or what about: ""Lucy, denial is a river in Egypt. Your husband is gay""? That was Williams dispensing advice to a radio caller having marital issues.
The show would veer from wildly entertaining, to slightly chaotic, to sometimes outright offensive, as Williams gave her views on pop culture and current events.
In 2012, she was swarmed by the Beyhive for saying that Beyonce ""talks like she has a fifth-grade education"".
And she caused controversy while gossiping with her audience about Spears' struggles to free herself of a conservatorship imposed by her father.
""How dare you, Mr Spears, you had me fooled. And you too, Mrs Spears. Death to all of them,"" she declared before her stunned audience.
But in 2017, during a Halloween-themed episode, Williams passed out live on air while dressed as the Statue of Liberty.
""That was the first sign something was really wrong,"" Finnie said during an interview with People Magazine the following year.
Williams said the fainting incident was likely due to Graves' disease, an autoimmune condition that affects the thyroid.
In 2019, Williams, who has always been open about her history of drug dependency, announced that she was living in a sober house, and had broken up with her husband after she learned he was having a baby with another woman.
""You know I've had a struggle with cocaine in my past, and I never went to a place to get the treatment,"" Williams told her audience with her trademark candour.
But as the years passed, her health struggles spiralled, and more diagnoses followed: lymphedema which causes painful swelling in the feet, a shoulder fracture, and alcoholism.
Her show scrambled to find guest hosts when she was unwell, and entire seasons were delayed to give her time to recover.

In the documentary Where Is Wendy Williams?, her former employees said she often struggled to communicate, and her short-term memory was sometimes impaired.
""I don't know what the hell is going on. I think she's losing memory. She doesn't know who I am sometimes,"" her driver said in the docuseries.
In 2022, The Wendy Williams Show was cancelled.
The show had been the mainstay in Williams' life, her identity and her source of connection.
The loss was devastating.
But Williams had no idea that her biggest battle was yet to come.
Williams says her journey into the care facility began with a simple request to access her bank statements because she suspected a financial advisor of misconduct, and was considering moving her money elsewhere.
When Wells Fargo refused, Williams alleged that she defaulted on several bills.
The matter ended up in court in early 2022, with Wells Fargo seeking a guardianship for Williams, claiming that she was an ""incapacitated person"".
Through her lawyer, Williams insisted she was of sound mind.
""It saddens Wendy that Wells Fargo, has chosen to believe the allegations of a former employee who is upset because she no longer has direct and unfettered access to Wendy's financial affairs,"" LaShawn Thomas said.
Wells Fargo denied any wrongdoing, saying its priority was Williams' financial wellbeing.
Williams has never denied living large, but she has always maintained that the money she has earned over the years is hers to spend as she wishes.
In the docuseries about her life, she said she spent $US120,000 ($190,000) on her son's birthday party and contributed $US80,000 to his rent.

But as her health issues worsened, a New York court questioned whether her son was an appropriate guardian to look after her finances.
""While [her son, Kevin] apologised for past mistakes and inappropriate behaviour, the court is not convinced that he can keep her safe and wouldn't willingly or unwittingly expose her to financial exploitation,"" court documents said.
So the court appointed lawyer, Sabrina Morrissey, as Williams' guardian.
Her representatives said the star was diagnosed with progressive aphasia and FTD in 2023, and moved into the assisted care facility where she has remained for almost three years.
FTD is an umbrella term for a group of neurodegenerative disorders that affect the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain, causing changes in behaviour, personality.
""I am not cognitively impaired but I feel like I am in prison,"" she said when calling into The Breakfast Club podcast.
""I'm in this place with people who are in their 90s and their 80s and their 70s […] These people, there's something wrong with these people here on this floor. I am clearly not.""
Williams said she couldn't leave the facility without permission, and her family couldn't visit her or call her without seeking approval.
""I don't have frontotemporal dementia … I am not a baby,"" she insisted.
Last month, Williams signed an affidavit asking for the guardianship to be removed, saying she has ""regained the capacity"" to live independently.
No longer able to wait for the judge's response, she took matters into her own hands this week and tossed a scribbled plea for help into the street below.
It's unclear exactly how many Americans live under conservatorships or guardianships, but lawyers estimate it's more than 1 million people.
Some have disabilities, others are living with cognitive issues like dementia.
With the Britney Spears case shining the spotlight on conservatorships, advocates are pushing for change.
But legal experts and advocates have long maintained that the system is shrouded in secrecy and difficult to escape, meaning that some fully grown adults have no power over their own destinies.
After Spears alleged her own family used a conservatorship to control her for nearly 14 years, several states moved to clean up the legal practice.
In New York, where Williams is based, the state governor Kathy Hochul is being asked to consider a massive overhaul of legal guardianships.
""Too many people have been failed by this system, and a real overhaul is long overdue,"" New York City Council member Crystal Hudson said in January.
""We need a system that instils confidence — one that guarantees people in need of guardianships a dignified existence.""
Williams says she will petition the court again to have her guardianship terminated.  (FilmMagic/Getty: Michael Tran)
Williams' court-appointed guardian has pushed back against the star's claims about her predicament and the state of her health.
Her representative says the care facility where Williams is living has ""excellent medical care, a spa, a workout room, excellent food, a dining room and outside terraces"".
She also said it is ultimately up to a judge to determine whether to terminate the guardianship he ordered, and Williams is free to petition the court.
For her part, Williams says she wants to regain control of her own fate, and will never give up the fight.
""I've been doing important things all of my life,"" she said during a phone interview on talk show The View.
""These people don't look like me. They don't talk like me. They don't act like me. They will never be me. I need them to get off my neck.""",ABC News,music

Ivey says the young Emmaleen is her most autobiographical character. (Supplied: Hachette Australia)
Look closely at the cover of Alaskan author Eowyn Ivey's latest novel and you'll discover the magic at its centre. The illustration shows a stand of dark trees with a bear standing beneath — a bear with the shadow of a man.
Our bear-man is Arthur, a quiet, reclusive man who — yes really — periodically transforms into a bear and goes wandering in the Alaskan woods. But Birdie, a single mum and waitress who falls in love with Arthur, doesn't know that.
Author Eowyn Ivey discusses her new book, Black Woods, Blue Sky, a magical tale set in the beautiful and rugged wilds of Alaska.
It all sounds a bit silly. But in Ivey's careful hands, this strange premise works. The author (whose previous novel, The Snow Child, introduced a similarly fanciful concept) keeps the story grounded in reality: Birdie is a flawed young mum who drinks too much and yearns for a simpler life, closer to nature. In Arthur, she finds a genuine connection and the chance for change.
Birdie's six-year-old daughter, Emmaleen, is wonderfully drawn — it's Emmaleen who learns Arthur's secret and realises the very real danger that mother and daughter face. And that sense of peril permeates the novel from the opening page.
Read it for the breathtaking Alaskan landscapes, read it for the heartbreaking mother-daughter story, or read it for the magic. But make sure you read it.

Brooks, who won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 2006, is the author of six novels and three works of non-fiction. (Hachette Australia)
It's May 2019 and Geraldine Brooks is blindsided by a phone call. Her husband, Tony Horwitz, also a writer, has died in the street — away from home, on a book tour, unexpectedly. Brooks is blindsided by grief and shock, of course, but also by the cruelty of the way she's told. The callous tiredness of the doctor who phones her, the lack of pause, the ways in which the system that held onto his body and processed the story allowed no compassion.
In the immediate aftermath, she had to act, alert their children, tell people, hurl herself onto a ferry from the island on which they lived, then onto a plane, away into the world of bureaucracy and organisation and information. All of this was brutal. All of it was hard. But she got on and she did it.
She was also finishing her sixth novel — Horse — and then travelling the world to talk about it, which she did with poise and reflection. One thing she wasn't able to do on that tour was talk about her husband. This was a private, howling grief.
Three years after his death, she realised she needed to return to that terrible day, to try to understand what had happened, both to him and to her. And she did this by taking herself to an island off the coast of Tasmania, a place of colonial heartbreak and pain, to find solitude and the space for memory — to tell a love story, to write a portrait, not just of the man she'd married, but what they were like together: an Australian and an American navigating the world and their own cultural differences; two foreign correspondents interested in world events; two writers who read each other's work and supported each other's ideas.
This book is the result: it's not just an elegy, it's also something else. An exploration and a reflection on grief; a portrait of love; a flinty facing-down of the hardest week. It's about mourning and memory, but it's not mournful. There's joy in it, as well as sorrow.

Disappoint Me is the second offering from Dinan, whose debut novel, Bellies, came out in 2023. (Supplied: Penguin Books Australia)
Disappoint Me is filled with beautifully flawed and fully realised characters.
It's about a romance between Max, a poet and lawyer who spends her days pretending to be an AI legal assistant bot for a tech company, and Vincent, a British-Chinese corporate lawyer who finds his joy in baking and playing clarinet.
Max is an unusual love interest in that she doesn't seem to have much interest in love. As she says in her apathetic and dry manner, ""I've lost many friends to heteronormativity in the last couple of years. Even queer ones."" Max sees Vincent's life, friends and even their relationship as almost alien displays of heteronormativity. As a trans woman she feels on the outside, with Vincent her only ticket in.
Despite this, Max and Vincent fall into easy harmony and closeness, seeking comfort in the surety of their love over the excitements of passion.
The story follows dual timelines, in present day with their burgeoning relationship, and in 2012 on Vincent's gap year in Thailand. A painful story of toxic masculinity unravels there that Vincent wants to keep from Max at all costs.
Dinan's prose is stark and delicate, sewing incisive comments on race, privilege, money, womanhood and trans identity between poignant takes on love and regret.
Disappoint Me is an immersive and sharp queer love story, published at a time when those are more important than ever.

Greenwell also writes criticism for The New Yorker and The Atlantic. (Supplied: Pan Macmillan Australia)
If the USA ever opts for free — or even affordable — health care, many writers will lose the plot. Literally: the plot of screenplays, where characters hustle or rob or con their way towards bill payment, will disappear; the plot of novels, where someone delays turning up at the Emergency Department because their ""insurance"" might not cover the cost of treatment. All gone.
Instead, in Garth Greenwell's latest novel, Small Rain, the unnamed 40-something narrator (a poet) is undone by sudden, inexplicable pain. It's the type of pain that respects no conventional scale, and he resists heading to the hospital for five days. His Spanish partner, a man referred to as L (also a poet) is confounded by this. The narrator turns his face away, looks inward, gasps, and tries to make sense of it through words and memories and story.
The latest and best fiction reviewed by a team of dedicated bibliophiles.
In the end, he makes it to a hospital, and discovers that yes, indeed, he might have died. He's too young for this, too loved for this, too full of words for this. And with beautiful acuity, he observes the people and systems and hierarchies around him — the small moments of kindness, as well as the indifferent cruelties; the fear embedded, not just in hospitals but in a world suddenly dealing with coronavirus as well; the frustrations and fear of a body newly unknown and unreliable.
This is a book that begins with a body in pain but moves through personal histories and sex, family stories and brutalities, art and poetry, romance and a house renovation.
It's also a novel at play with memoir and autofiction: it reads like ""real life"", but is labelled a novel. It shares details with both Greenwell's own life and the lives created in his earlier books (Cleanness, What Belongs to You). It also, surprisingly, shares a revealing moment of body shame and reflection with an Australian poet — hang on, isn't that X? — who is not named until you read the acknowledgements. So read on, read it all.

The first Asian woman to win the Nobel Prize in Literature — and one of its youngest recipients — Han Kang's latest novel explores the legacy of state-sanctioned violence that directly affected her parents' generation in Korea.
Kyungha is barely able to sleep or eat. Her pain isolates her. The line separating nightmare and reality has begun to blur.
She suffers anxiety. Everywhere she looks, bodies are fragile, death-stricken. She does not tell others about the visions she experiences. She fears they will not believe her. Even the autumn trees with their stripped bark resemble ""grey-white flesh stripped raw"".
Most of her time is spent writing ""a letter of farewell addressed to everyone"". Walking to the room where she writes, she imagines snipers on the rooftops, guns poised.
Hosts Kate Evans and Cassie McCullagh dissect Nobel Prize winner Han Kang's latest novel, We Do Not Part.
Gradually, we learn that the manuscript she is working on is connected to a real historical event. Beginning in late 1948, the Korean government suppressed a left-wing insurgency on Jeju, a volcanic island off the southern coast. Homes and lives were destroyed. Official estimates vary, but American allies were told the military and police killed around one-fifth of the island's population, or 60,000 people.
An unexpected message from a former coworker, Inseon, draws Kyungha out of isolation. Both Inseon's parents are survivors of the insurgency. Returning to the village to rebuild, her parents kept this violence hidden for the rest of their lives. When Inseon suffers a logging accident, she asks Kyungha to travel to the family home to care for two budgies left there. Kyungha's visit unearths secrets — and helps her begin to make sense of the pain she has been experiencing.
Picture a painting whose outlines are stark and whose colours are slowly filled in. That is how Kang writes. Like the gorgeously described snow throughout the book, this is a spare, haunting novel.
We Do Not Part is about how we must wait for years, even lifetimes, to hear the stories of people who have waited a lifetime to find the words for them.

You might assume that a novel about deradicalising ISIS brides would be serious or sombre. However, Nussaibah Younis's debut novel, Fundamentally, is silly, entertaining and deeply irreverent, translating a difficult topic into an easy read.
Protagonist Nadia's life in London is falling apart. Her girlfriend has left her, her mother ends each conversation by telling her she's going to hell and her relationship to religion is shot. Nadia makes the somewhat rash decision to move to Baghdad to run the controversial (and not particularly evidence-based), United Nations Deradicalisation Organisation — aptly titled UNDO.
Novels by Sally Rooney, Tim Winton and Booker Prize winner Samantha Harvey top our critics' favourite reads of the year.
As an expert in this field, Younis is perfectly situated to poke fun at the absurdity of humanitarian work and UN bureaucrats. We meet Pierre, the son of a French Tom, the head of security, an archetypal jock; and ""Sheikh Jason"" who prefers ""receiving energy from crystals"" over Islamic teaching.
Nadia is out of her depth. When she meets Sara, one of the women she is tasked with rehabilitating, she is transfixed. A gobby and rude East Londoner, Sara reminds Nadia of herself, forcing her to question her purpose at UNDO and whether she is just, as Sara calls her, ""a slag with a saviour complex"".
The writing is fun and conversational, and Younis depicts with honesty how difficult it is to find the moral ""right"" within the grey of conflict.

Probert seeks to learn how Roy from Wales became Bill from Kent in her family memoir. (Supplied: Upswell Publishing)
When Belinda Probert was growing up, her father never shared stories about his childhood. He attended King's College in London and served in the army in World War II — but Probert knew little else. Her father lived in the moment, travelling the globe as an executive for a multinational company and pursuing his passions for luxury cars and fly fishing in his spare time. He was sometimes beset by fits of rage when he drank too much but was otherwise a loving husband and father.
For Probert — a social scientist who was born in the UK but moved to Australia in 1976 — it never felt strange that her father didn't talk about his past. ""We probably assumed that his silence meant that Bill did not have any particularly interesting stories to tell,"" she writes in her latest book.
Author Belinda Probert discusses her search to uncover her father's secret past.
She learned just how misguided this assumption was when a letter arrived four months after Bill's death in 1994, revealing he was born to a large mining family in Wales and had disappeared at the end of World War II. It was a startling revelation to Bill's grieving widow, Janet, and his three children, who had no sense of his Welsh origins, particularly given his polished English accent.
Nearly 30 years later, Probert embarks on a mission to uncover the truth about her father. As she painstakingly pieces together his secret past, she sees Bill anew: as the son of a Welsh coal miner, a star student who became a gifted linguist, a war hero and perhaps a spy.
In her search for answers, Probert takes the reader along for the ride, documenting her amateur sleuthing and the roadblocks she encounters. Because this is real life, there is no neat resolution at the end. Most of the story's main players are dead, which means they can never answer questions about the past. Nor can Bill's family ever ask him why he hid his identity for so long. After surveying her father's fascinating life, Probert is left with more questions than answers — perhaps the most salient being, how well can we ever know our parents?

Ernaux's account of her love affair while undergoing cancer treatment was serialised in The New Yorker. (Supplied: Penguin Books Australia)
French author Annie Ernaux, another Nobel Prize in Literature winner, is known for her bracing examinations of sex and relationships, much of it semi-autobiographical.
Her latest is a little different: a collaborative memoir with Marc Marie, a photojournalist with whom she had an intense relationship in 2003. The book is interspersed with 14 pictures taken during their relationship, shown alongside meditations by each lover, detailing the emotional arc of their brief but forceful affair.
Ernaux asks the question that perhaps lies at the heart of all past relationships: what did it all mean?
Your favourite fiction authors share the story behind their latest books.
During the relationship, Ernaux is undergoing chemotherapy for breast cancer. The body becomes undeniable. She describes the photographs in ways that render them tactile, organic. They are, she says, like ""blood, semen and urine stains on sheets, or old mattresses, discarded on pavements […] the stains of wine or food embedded in the wood of sideboards, the stains of coffee or greasy fingers on old letters — the most material and organic kinds of stains.""
Ernaux takes the apparent stillness and solidity of each photograph as an invitation to reflect upon the hidden movements and life changes they secretly depict: a pair of boots lying far apart upon the floor reflects ""the force with which they were flung off"" before making love; a sheaf of scattered manuscript notes lying beside an office cord reminds her how passion let her forget, for a moment, her cancer.
The Use of Photography offers a challenge: if we cannot make sense of love and death, how do we at least think about them? Few acts put the present into focus like a love affair, particularly a short one.

Australia's Good Life Festival announces it is skipping 2025 edition due to rising costs,Jared Richards,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-19/good-life-australia-festival-cancelled-2025/105071776,"Good Life Presents is the latest Australian music festival to announce it will not return for 2025, citing ""rising operational and talent costs"".
Launched in 2010, Good Life is a multi-city day festival exclusively for teenagers. It has held more than 100 events nationally — most recently, last April's Lost City Festival in Brisbane and Sydney, headlined by US rapper Lil Pump and UK DJ Joel Corry. A 2025 event had not been announced.
In a social media statement shared on Wednesday, the festival — owned by Mushroom Group — reassured audiences that ""this isn't goodbye"", adding that it planned to return in 2026.
It continued: ""These challenges have made it unfeasible to deliver the world-class line-up and experience that Australian teens have come to expect.
Good Life has previously featured major international and Australian acts such as Avicii, The Kid LAROI, Lil Uzi Vert, Macklemore, Havana Brown, Rudimental, Skrillex and A$AP Rocky.
The cancellation is another blow to Australia's festival market, following the cancellation of large-scale events Splendour In The Grass and Groovin The Moo, both for the second year running.
In February, Souled Out cancelled a week before it was due to begin in Melbourne, the first of three events.
""Like many festivals in Australia, we have faced ongoing challenges in the current market,"" Souled Out's statement read.
Just over half of Australian music festivals are actually turning a profit, according to new research from Creative Australia.
Last year, arts investment and advisory body Creative Australia released a report into the music festival sector that found more than one-third of Australian music festivals were losing money as the sector faced increased operational costs.
The report found only 56 per cent of music festivals in 2022–23 were profitable and that young audiences between 18 and 24 years old were no longer the sector's primary market.
In March, a parliamentary inquiry into Australia's live music sector recommended a variety of ways to help the industry. These included tax offsets, a rebate or voucher scheme for 18-24-year-olds in line with programs in Germany, France and Spain, and the reduction or abolition of policing costs for festivals.",ABC News,music
Medieval manuscript in Australia may hold key to mystery of The Lady and the Unicorn masterpiece,Mary McGillivray,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-10/lady-and-unicorn-musee-cluny-wharncliffe-hours-art-mystery/105002634,"In his autobiographical account, The Travels of Marco Polo, the famous 13th-century Venetian explorer recorded his visit to Sumatra, Indonesia.
""There are wild elephants in the country"", he wrote, ""and numerous unicorns, which are very nearly as big. They have hair like that of a buffalo, feet like those of an elephant, and a horn in the middle of the forehead, which is black and very thick.""
Obviously, the creature Marco Polo was describing was not a unicorn, but a rhinoceros.
However, it's important to remember that, to the average medieval European, unicorns were not mythical, but a zoological truth.
Medieval art is full of unicorns. One famous example is the series of tapestries known as the Lady and the Unicorn, which now hang in the Musée Cluny in Paris.
And the artworks have an unexpected connection to a precious manuscript in Melbourne.
The Cluny tapestries have been the subject of debate ever since the museum acquired them in 1882.

Dating to around 1500 and woven in wool and silk, they are rare survivors of a fragile — and incredibly expensive — art form. Even without the mystery that surrounds them, they would still be considered masterpieces.
Each of the six tapestries features a woman, dressed in very fine clothing and jewellery, accompanied by a gleaming white unicorn.
Art historians generally agree that five works in the series represent the five senses: smell, taste, touch, sight and sound.
In the scene thought to be ""Touch"", the lady takes small sugared sweets from a bowl presented to her by a servant, while in ""Sound"" she plays an organ.
For ""Sight"", the lady sits with the unicorn gently resting in her lap as she holds a mirror so that the creature may admire its own reflection.
The sixth tapestry, however, throws a bit of a spanner in the neat, allegorical works.
The largest of the set, the final scene in the series, shows the same woman in the canopy of an elaborate tent, upon which a mysterious motto can be read: ""À Mon Seul Désir"" (""To my heart's desire"").
Beneath this motto, the lady is depicted removing her jewels and placing them in a chest, while the standard-bearing lion and unicorn watch on.
The tapestries were probably commissioned by the Le Viste family, whose heraldry (a red and blue banner with three crescent moons) is seen on every tapestry. (Supplied: Musee Cluny/Wikimedia Commons)
This tapestry has been interpreted in many ways: maybe it is a dedication to the intended recipient of the tapestries, a declaration of love, or a commemoration of a marriage, or perhaps the scene represents a ""sixth sense"" — a higher sense than the rest — where all wealth and pleasures are abandoned in favour of the heart's truest desire.
But there are other clues about how to read the tapestries in richly illuminated medieval manuscripts, many of which — you might be surprised to learn — are hidden away in Australia's own public collections.
One such deliciously decorated book is the Wharncliffe Hours: the first manuscript to be acquired by the National Gallery of Victoria, which purchased it at auction in 1920.
The Wharncliffe Hours gets its name from its 19th-century owner, the first Earl of Wharncliffe. (Supplied: National Gallery of Victoria, Felton Bequest, 1920)
The 15th-century French ""book of hours"" — or prayer book — is filled with psalms, prayers, stories from the Gospels and calendars of important Christian feast days.
In one of the pages of this richly decorated book is a scene that will look familiar to any fan of the famous Cluny tapestries.
Just like in the Cluny tapestries, we see a finely dressed woman with a unicorn sitting in her lap, mesmerised by its own reflection in a mirror.
This scene is not strictly, however, an allegory of sight: it has a much more loaded meaning.

What we are seeing here is known as the ""entrapment of the unicorn"" — a popular narrative in medieval art.
According to medieval belief, the unicorn was a powerful and ferocious creature whose horn possessed antidotal properties that could be used to counteract poisons. In attempts to capture a unicorn, however, only a virgin woman was pure enough to coax the beast into submission.
By the 15th century, the tale had morphed into ""the hunt of the unicorn"", where stories of hunting parties with dogs and spears use a chaste virgin to capture and slaughter the magical beast.
In the 15th century, unicorns began to be depicted as animals worthy of attack, such as in this painting, The Hunters Return to the Castle (1495–1505). (Supplied: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York/John D. Rockefeller Jr., 1937)
Aside from serving as a chivalrous tale of 15th-century hunting culture at European courts, the story of the entrapment of the unicorn also reflects late-medieval ideas about gender and sexuality.
Not only was the supposed purity of the virgin who captured the unicorn associated with the immaculate conception of the Virgin Mary, but it also served as a warning to men about the guiles of women and their powers to ""entrap"" men.
At best, the starving artist trope is a manufactured aesthetic of suffering. At worst, it's a convenient way to excuse the poverty many artists throughout history have endured.
The other scenes in the margins of the Wharncliffe Hours reveal just how deep this idea ran.
In the top right corner of the same page, we see another woman who mirrors the virgin below. But this woman is Delilah, and it's not a unicorn resting in her lap, but Samson.
In the Old Testament tale of Samson and Delilah, the sex worker entraps Samson by cutting his hair, and thus breaking his vow to God as a Nazarite.

The illustrators of the Wharncliffe Hours have deliberately presented these two stories — the capture of the unicorn and Samson and Delilah — together on one page to inspire meditation on the virtues of chaste women, and the dangers of female entrapment.
For a set of tapestries that is commonly thought to be about love, devotion and marriage, this love comes with a caveat: the women deserving of devotion and praise are those who remain chaste and pure.
The Lady and the Unicorn is not only a reminder of some of the more troubling ideas about women's sexuality that have been passed down to us, but it also prompts us to remember that all art — old and new — carries multiple meanings.",ABC News,music
"The Electric State, a Netflix adaptation of a graphic novel, is one of the most expensive movies ever made",By Jamie Tram,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-17/the-electric-state-review-millie-bobby-brown-chris-pratt/105046498,"When it comes to its line-up of exclusive blockbusters, Netflix has never been one to spare any expense — even if it means hitting subscribers with another price hike.
Netflix's latest big-ticket release arrives in the form of The Electric State, a $US320 million adaptation of Simon Stålenhag's dystopic graphic novel, which sits among the most expensive movies ever made.
What: In an alternate sci-fi vision of the 90s where robots have been outlawed, a teenage girl goes searching for her brother with a smuggler and a team of misfit machines.
Starring: Millie Bobby Brown, Chris Pratt, Ke Huy Quan, Stanley Tucci, Giancarlo Esposito
Directed by: The Russo Brothers
Where: Streaming now on Netflix
Likely to make you feel: Negatively charged
Its directors, Joe and Anthony Russo, are no strangers to titanic Hollywood productions. Avengers: Infinity War and Endgame had a combined price tag of a billion dollars and demonstrated the brothers' unparalleled talent for finding a clear path through an impenetrable thicket of plot lines, acting schedules, CGI punch-ons and merchandising deals.
The Electric State has no shortage of other Avengers alumni. Chris Pratt (Guardians of the Galaxy) stars as another Han Solo rip-off, whose robot sidekick is voiced by Anthony Mackie (Captain America: Brave New World). Writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, editor Jeffrey Ford and composer Alan Silvestri also collaborated with the Russos on Endgame.

But even when re-assembled with the talents behind their record-breaking superhero hits and equipped with a blank cheque, the film suffocates within the brothers' narrow creative limits.
Stålenhag's enigmatic approach to world building is immediately jettisoned via an opening info-dump montage: an alternate timeline of the 90s has seen animatronics revolt against their human masters, resulting in all-out war. The machines are on the precipice of winning — until tech CEO Ethan Skate (Stanley Tucci) invents an army of humanoid drones (controlled via neural interface) that turn the tide.
The Electric State kicks off several years after the war, where the surviving robots have been contained within a walled-off chunk of New Mexico termed the 'Exclusion Zone', and Skate's technology has enjoyed widespread adoption in the form of 'Neurocasters': chunky helmets that silo brainwaves into remote work and VR leisure simultaneously, leaving its users drooling and slack-jawed underneath.
The movie is strongest when it leans into the famous imagery from Stålenhag's graphic novel, particularly the disintegrating machines left to rust away after the war. (Supplied: Netflix)
Millie Bobby Brown plays Michelle, a rebellious teenager whose family died in a car accident during the war. At home, her foster dad lords over her primarily in drone form; at school, she resists the mandatory use of Neurocasters.
When the mind of her genius brother Christopher (Woody Norman; C'mon C'mon) suddenly resurfaces as the robot mascot from their favourite cartoon, she embarks on a road trip to the Exclusion Zone — picking up Pratt's roguish smuggler Keats along the way — to uncover the truth behind his apparent death.
The sooner movies abandon Gen X nostalgia, the better. The Electric State isn't a sci-fi adventure so much as it is a saccharine skip down memory lane; tributes are lovingly paid to a bygone American era of strip malls and twinkies, littered with twee covers of rock anthems.
Nowhere is the film's consumerist zeal more grating than in the prominence of real-life peanut butter mascot Mr Peanut, who's first glimpsed negotiating a peace treaty with Bill Clinton — an absurd sight gag that grows less funny the more screen time he's afforded. Voiced by Woody Harrelson, he's the leader of a group of animatronics who've made a new home within the Zone, and inexplicably becomes a driving voice of reason and compassion within the film.
Mr Peanut was killed off during a Superbowl commercial in 2020. Now he's the face of the revolution, for some reason.
There are other characters that exist within the Russos' new film, but none of them manage to crawl out from the shadow cast by this civil rights figurehead wrought from a walking, talking, and ghoulishly rendered advertising meme.
Besides, what else is there to say about Chris Pratt's reluctant manchild hero, except that he's clearly too old to still be doing this shtick? Ke Huy Quan (Everything Everywhere All At Once), on the other hand, has been criminally underutilised in his post-Oscars career — and is stuck playing a mysterious scientist working for Skate, with a screen time of mere minutes. Both are straddled with the least-convincing wigs $US320 million can buy.
The Electric State briefly switches on when it recreates Stålenhag's famous imagery, particularly that of hulking mechanical colossi rusting away in misty fields, or the parasitic headsets lodged to people's faces. The more disquieting implications of its world, as well as the despairing, melancholic tone of the Swedish artist's work, are understandably elided in this family-friendly blockbuster, yet raises questions of why the graphic novel was adapted in the first place.
The enormous budget seemingly doesn't extend to the wig department in Electric State. (Supplied: Netflix)
From their beginnings in experimental film to their pitch-perfect genre parodies in Community, it's apparent the Russo brothers have some affection for the medium. Yet their output over the past decade suggests a far greater passion for distilling cinema into content. Their films have increasingly challenged how flat and colourless an action blockbuster can be, and how hard the backs of CGI artists can be broken.
They bill themselves as independent filmmakers, only to use their extraordinary capital, goodwill and creative largesse to cook up different flavours of generic, straight-to-streaming slop.
The Electric State not only suggests that robots can have a soul — it convincingly argues that its filmmakers are still searching for one.",ABC News,music
"ICYMI: Hollywood director arrested for swindling Netflix for $17 million, Jason Isaacs retracts White Lotus penis comments",By Velvet Winter,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-21/white-lotus-gal-godot-snow-white-netflix/105080128,"Welcome to ICYMI, where we recap the pop culture and entertainment news you might have missed over the past week.
Carl Erik Rinsch — best known for directing 2013 action film 47 Ronin — has been arrested and charged with wire fraud and money laundering this week.
Prosecutors will argue that Rinsch conducted a scheme to defraud Netflix after the streaming giant paid him millions of dollars for a show that never materialised.
This new one-take crime drama takes toxic masculinity to a violent extreme.
Netflix paid Rinsch $US44 million ($69 million) for an unfinished show called White Horses, and later another $US11 million ($17 million) to wrap up production.
However, according to prosecutors, Rinsch didn't spend this money on production, instead funnelling the $11 million into a personal account and promptly losing around half of it on bad investments over two months.
The filmmaker clawed some of the money back by dumping it into the cryptocurrency market and then went on a spending spree.
According to prosecutors, Rinsch spent about $10 million on personal expenses and luxury items, including credit card bills, lawyers to sue Netflix for more money, furniture and antiques, five Rolls-Royces and one Ferrari, watches and clothes.
Rinsch had an initial hearing at a Los Angeles court earlier in the week where he did not enter a plea and agreed to pay a $US100,000 ($150,000) bond.
He'll face a New York court on his charges at a later, unspecified date.
While you may be familiar with Jason Isaacs for his role as Lucius Malfoy in the Harry Potter series, he's made a new name for himself as a shady southern businessman with a lorazepam habit in the latest series of The White Lotus.
The HBO hit has long been known for its comic portrayal of male nudity; from season one's anilingus scene to Theo James's nine-inch flash in season two.
And as Isaac's character, Timothy Ratliff, unravelled, so too did his hotel-supplied bathrobe, which slipped in episode four this season, revealing his genitalia to his horrified children.

But when questioned about whether he used a prosthetic, Isaacs complained about a ""double standard"" for male actors, pointing to Margaret Qualley's nude scenes in The Substance and Mikey Madison's role as a sex worker in Anora.
""I don't see anybody discussing her vulva, which was on [the screen] all the time,"" he told CBS mornings.
After online backlash, Isaacs has since backtracked on his comment, telling Variety, he ""said the wrong words in the wrong way"".
""I was tired — I'd done so many interviews,"" Isaacs explained.
""There is a [different] double standard — women have been monstrously exploited and men haven't.""
The 61-year-old actor admitted he ""absolutely should not"" have specifically referred to the two Oscar-nominated actresses, who he said he was ""a massive fan of"" and respects ""enormously"".
""My point wasn't that men have had a harder time than women — that would be absurd.""
Aaron Blabey, the Australian author and illustrator behind The Bad Guys book series — which was turned into an animated heist movie starring Sam Rockwell and comedian Marc Maron in 2022 — signed an eight-figure book deal this week.
""I have a little formula on my wall... it's just 'smart-dumb, funny-scary.' I just have to find [the] balance between those elements in each [Bad Guys book],"" Blabey said in 2022. (Supplied: Universal)
The bestselling children's author will write seven new books for tweens for publisher Macmillan, to be released in the UK, US and Australia. The books will drop in two series: the first a collection of fantasy books titled Game of Pets, expected in 2026, and the second called The Awfuls.
""In June 2023, I completed the final Bad Guys book — my 40th title in 10 years — and genuinely felt it might be time to retire. I mean, that's a lot of books!"" Blabey says.
""However, the infectious enthusiasm of everyone at Macmillan for a pair of new ideas (that I had quietly tucked away) has made me think perhaps all I needed was a holiday and a shot of new positive energy. I am very excited to get back to work.""
DreamWorks’ latest feature adapts the bestselling Australian kids book series about a posse of ‘bad’ animals learning to be good.
Blabey's books have sold about 55 million copies, with the author first finding an audience with his picture book series about a crotchety dog: Pig the Pug; and following it up with Thelma the Unicorn, the story of a somewhat-delusional pony that was turned into a Netflix movie (starring Brittany Howard from blues rock band Alabama Shakes) last year.
Blabey explained to ABC Arts in 2022 he thought The Bad Guys — about a gang of anthropomorphic criminal animals — resonated with children because it looked like the kind of book they might not be allowed to read.
""That cover with the four guys in the black suits, it was very Reservoir Dogs-ish, and it looked like something that [a kid's] older brother might look at, but not them,"" he said. ""And they suddenly realised it was not only for them, but pitched directly to them.""
The second Bad Guys movie is due out later this year. The 20th — and final — book in the series was released in 2024.
Israeli actor Gal Gadot's Hollywood Walk of Fame ceremony earlier this week was disrupted by protesters on either side of the Israel-Gaza conflict.

Police were called after a pro-Palestine protester stole an Israeli flag and the event was delayed by approximately 15 minutes, according to Variety.
Disney's decade-long mission to remake their classic animation catalogue marches on with a live action remake of their first feature.
About two dozen demonstrators reportedly gathered, and a video shared by Variety reporter Katcy Stephan on X (Twitter) depicted pro-Palestine supporters chanting ""shame on Gal Gadot"".
Another video from Stephan showed a pro-Israel protester declare that Gadot was ""being persecuted because she is [Jewish] and we will not stand for anti-Semitism"".
In an interview with Variety ahead of her Hollywood honour on Tuesday, Gadot said she had no regrets about speaking out post-October 7, 2023.
""I was shocked by the amount of hate, by the amount of how much people think they know when they actually have no idea, and also by how the media is not fair many times. So I had to speak up.
""When your compass is clear, your conscience is clean. I know what I'm advocating for, and I know what I wish for the world.""

Author Robert Lukins examines the ultra-rich in Succession-like Somebody Down There Likes Me,Nicola Heath,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-16/robert-lukins-author-somebody-down-there-likes-me/105042750,"In 2022, Robert Lukins spent three months traversing the United States in a tiny one-and-a-half-seater aeroplane built by his friend and travel companion.
They were on the hunt for ghost towns — a shared obsession — in places like the Sierra Nevada and Death Valley, when they made a pit stop in Yosemite National Park.
It was there Lukins befriended a rock climber with a hidden past.
""He was a self-professed dirtbag who lived out of the back of a van and lived for climbing rocks,"" Lukins tells ABC Radio National's The Book Show.
""One night, he let slip that he'd grown up in a family of billionaires, and he was from this very tiny, very strange town called Belle Haven in Connecticut.""

The rock climber — whose ultra-rich neighbours had included members of the Kennedy clan, Donald Trump and Diana Ross — said his hometown had a ""gurgling undercurrent of strangeness and drug addiction and scandal"".
Captivated by the tale, Lukins decided he had to see Belle Haven for himself and headed east. After following ""some sketchy directions"", he eventually arrived at its perimeter.
Undeterred by the imposing fences and patrolling security guards, Lukins slipped through a hedge into the gated community.
Your favourite fiction authors share the story behind their latest books.
He was greeted by luxury on a scale he'd not before encountered.
""Every house was like a picture book version of a mansion; a great, glittering white edifice,"" he says.
He wandered along the streets until he came to the water, where, from over a nearby hedge, he could hear the ""thuck"" of a tennis ball being struck.
""Like a film, a tennis ball came arcing over the hedge, bounced in front of me and rolled in front of my feet. I picked it up, and stamped on it [was] 'Belle Haven Country Club' with a logo of a yacht sail,"" he recalls.
Lukins did just that. Somebody Down There Likes Me is his biting account of an ultra-rich family's fall from grace, and it's set in the 1990s in Belle Haven.
Fax and Honey Gulch have recalled their adult children, Lincoln and Kick, to their palatial home to deliver some bad news: time is up for the Gulch empire.
""Lukins is a great stylist,"" Jonty Claypole, Red Room Poetry CEO, said on ABC Radio National's The Bookshelf. (Supplied: Allen & Unwin)
Honey has heard — from the FBI agent to whom she clandestinely hands over envelopes of cash — that the authorities are closing in. But just what illegal acts the Gulches have committed are never specified.
Fax long ago relinquished control over the empire to his wife, who proves to be a shrewd, if nihilistic, CEO. For Honey, there's ""no useful difference between business of a criminal and non-criminal nature"".
Some have drawn comparisons between the Gulch clan and the Roy family from the smash hit HBO series Succession.
But Lukins — who has had a version of the Gulch family bouncing around his consciousness for years — has been fascinated by the ultra-rich since he was a small child.
""I would consume these books about the Rockefellers and [industrialist Andrew] Carnegie and great corporate collapses … in the same way that I was fascinated by books about UFOs and Bigfoot,"" he says.
""They may as well have been an alien species — they seemed to occupy space in a parallel universe.""
Lukins grew up as a ""fluoro-boardshorts-wearing, zinc-creamed kid on the Sunshine Coast"". (Supplied: Allen & Unwin)
As an adult, his perspective of the ultra-rich has changed.
""It's just money,"" he says.
""When we watch these people, it's comforting to think, 'These are almost another breed of human.' But there's the potential that they're quite a bit like us, just in vastly different circumstances. I'm interested in where that line exists, or whether it exists at all.""
The four members of the Gulch family are an unlikeable bunch.
But Lukins isn't afraid to admit they are, actually, all drawn from his own character.
""When you write, all your characters are fragments of yourself, and this time, they're me zoomed-in to monstrous proportions,"" he says.
The only character with anything resembling a moral compass is Kick, the prodigal daughter who cut ties with her family and its vast fortune 10 years earlier.
When the book opens, she's broke and pumping gas in a ghost town in the Nevada desert.
Kate Evans and Cassie McCullagh review new fiction, including Somebody Down There Likes Me by Robert Lukins.
But even Kick is accountable for her family's corruption.
""She has a great sense of justice and injustice, but all she does with that is burn up inside,"" Lukins says.
Kick fails to turn her rage into action, a sin of which Lukins feels he is similarly culpable.
""She feels both furious and powerless but also guilty for not doing what she knows she should be doing,"" he says.
""This was a little bit of self-analysis … I make myself feel better by walking around thinking the right thoughts and feeling the right way about injustices in the world. But if I put myself under the microscope, I'm not doing nearly as much as I could.

Somebody Down There Likes Me is a departure from Lukins' previous two novels, Loveland (2022) — a story exploring controlling male behaviour set in Nebraska — and his 2018 debut, The Everlasting Sunday, a poignant tale of teenage friendship set in an English boarding school in the 1960s.

The organisers, Holy Holy frontman Tim Carroll and Dan Rooke, have been contacted for comment.
A number of music festivals around the country, including Falls Festival in Tasmania's Marion Bay, have stopped running or announced extended breaks in recent years as it becomes increasingly tougher for organisers to break even.

The exact location of the forests has remained secret, with the government and Sustainable Timber Tasmania yet to provide any indication that it is considering logging the area near the festival site.

"Australian author Diana Reid returns with Signs of Damage, a thrilling summer noir set in France",Nicola Heath,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-22/diana-reid-australian-author-signs-of-damage/105075276,"A few years ago, Diana Reid began to see a trend emerge: the trauma plot. It was everywhere in books, films and television series.
""You get introduced to a character who's a bit odd or self-destructive — like Phoebe Waller-Bridge's character in Fleabag — and there are these flashbacks that penetrate the narrative that suggest something terrible happened,"" the author tells ABC Radio National's The Book Show.
""And then, in the last episode, you find out what that terrible thing was, and you feel this sense of resolution because you know why they were behaving like that all along.
Your favourite fiction authors share the story behind their latest books.
While Reid acknowledges that trauma can often explain problematic behaviour, she believes it has now become the default explanation.
She interrogates this ""cultural script"" in her latest novel, Signs of Damage, a follow-up to Love and Virtue (2021) and Seeing Other People (2022).
""I didn't want to reject that narrative entirely, or say that it's not true … I just wanted to query whether it always applies,"" she says.
In Signs of Damage, 13-year-old Cass joins her friend's family for a luxurious getaway at a villa in the south of France.
Two mysteries propel Signs of Damage, one set in 2008 and another in the present day. (Supplied: Ultimo Press)
To the starry-eyed teen, who has never travelled overseas before, ""the whole holiday was … impossibly chic and cultured"".
But one dark spot blights an otherwise idyllic sojourn: one afternoon, Cass goes missing. She's discovered several hours later trapped in a disused storage space on the grounds, shaken by her ordeal but otherwise unharmed.
When, as an adult, Cass begins to have seizures that medical professionals find difficult to explain, the traumatic incident takes on renewed significance.
""She has what's called a functional neurological disorder, which is essentially when you exhibit symptoms that don't have an identifiable physical cause,"" Reid explains.
Functional neurological disorder — or FND, as it's known — accounts for between 20 and 30 per cent of people who seek treatment for epilepsy.
""It's … psychosomatic,"" Reid says. ""The cause is in their mind, which is not to say it's not real, but it's neurological.""
The condition can also present as other hard-to-explain conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome and chronic fatigue syndrome.
Reid's interest in FND was piqued after reading All in Your Head by British neurologist Suzanne O'Sullivan.
She learned that in many cases, it's true that FND is caused by past trauma.
""[For these people], interrogating their past to find the triggering event can be really therapeutic,"" Reid says.
Reid says she treats each book as a new challenge. ""If you want to keep writing over a long time, it has to remain interesting to you."" (Supplied: Ultimo Press)
But this explanation doesn't account for every case.
""Some patients reported that they felt like everyone around them was imposing that explanation on them, and it could almost make them feel like if they just were more psychologically robust, or if they just faced up to their past, then they would be cured.""
As the narrative in Signs of Damage shifts between the south of France in 2008 and the present day in Sydney then Italy, the mystery of what happened to Cass in the hours she was missing and how it relates to her health is slowly revealed.
Her friend Anika — who has long harboured guilt about her part in the holiday incident — has a theory: ""Cass's seizures weren't just random eruptions; they were the ugly expression of what she had repressed.""
Whether she's right is one of the novel's central questions.
""The whole book is about how perception is flawed, and how people bend the facts to suit their story,"" Reid says.
There's another mystery in Signs of Damage. In the prologue, Cass is speaking to a coroner in a Tuscan police station. Someone has died after falling from a balcony — but we don't learn who until the novel's end.
She describes her book as ""summer noir"", a narrative set-up she likens to the popular TV series White Lotus.
But it's a genre with a long literary history, she says.
Of particular inspiration were Never Mind, the first book in Edward St Aubyn's Patrick Melrose series; The Line of Beauty by Alan Hollinghurst (which won the 2004 Booker Prize); and Swimming Pool, a 2003 French film starring Charlotte Rampling.
These stories — where terrible things befall the rich and powerful in luxurious settings — offer a satisfying sense of schadenfreude.
""They're fun to read,"" Reid says.
""That's why White Lotus is so popular — because you get the best of both worlds … all the escapism, but then you don't sacrifice the more thrilling elements of something darker.""

Launceston mayor criticised for 'hanging out' with controversial US singer Ronnie Radke,By Ashleigh Barraclough,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-18/launceston-mayor-matthew-garwood-ronnie-radke/105061988,"The mayor of Tasmania's second-largest city has been criticised by his community for posting a photo on social media with a US musician who has had multiple run-ins with the law.
Launceston Mayor Matthew Garwood posted to Facebook on Sunday about meeting Ronnie Radke, lead singer of metal band Falling in Reverse and previously Escape the Fate.
Radke has served prison time in the US and has previously faced charges including assault, aggravated assault, domestic violence and battery.
Cr Garwood posted a photo of himself with Radke, who recently toured Australia with Falling in Reverse.
(Facebook/MatthewGarwood)
""Maybe one of the most controversial characters in my generation of the hard rock music scene. Through Escape the Fate and now Falling in Reverse — Ronnie Radke!"" Cr Garwood wrote on Facebook.
""Was awesome to spend some time together and talk all things Tassie and personal growth and learning.
""Always a mic drop moment when I get to play the 'Mayor card'.
Cr Garwood's Facebook page states that it is his personal page and the ""views expressed"" are his own, although he has 20,000 followers and frequently uses it to comment on Launceston City Council matters.
A number of community members expressed concerns with Cr Garwood's post in the comments section.
""Openly hanging out with convicted criminals and abusers is a quite refreshing change for a politician. Normally they'll try and hide it.""
""How embarrassing, last person on Earth I'd want association with.""
""I can't believe an elected council representative ie mayor is this controversial or idiotic, what am I missing here?""
""Imagine posing with a person as detestable as this and when people voice concern for your open adulation of such a character, you just label them as 'haters' and don't address any of their concerns. What a disappointing post and response from what is meant to be a leader in our community.""
In response to a commenter who said the post was not a ""good look"", Cr Garwood said: ""why? People can't make mistakes and learn from them and then use their massive platform to express how things can positively change?""
Other commenters defended the mayor, saying he was allowed to spend his time as he wished and he may not agree with Radke's past actions.
Councillor Andrea Dawkins said she had received concerned messages from Launceston women about the mayor's Facebook post.
""They are understandably perplexed why our mayor would stand in solidarity with a person convicted of parole violations associated with violence,"" she said.
Cr Dawkins said she had raised the matter with the council chief executive.
Andrea Dawkins says some members of the community are ""understandably perplexed"". (ABC News: Georgia Hogge)
Councillor Lindi McMahon was also critical of the mayor's post.
""I stand in solidarity of all the women who have suffered at the hands of violence whose voices are continually silenced while men like Ronnie Radke are given hero status,"" she said.
""I'm sure the women of Launceston who attended the launch of the 16 days of activism [against gendered violence] would be questioning the sincerity of the words spoken by our mayor on that day.""
Councillor Tim Walker said ""all councillors must endeavour to not bring disrepute to the council, and therefore our city of Launceston"".
Councillor Joe Pentridge said ""we're getting a little too precious"".
""Matthew's being a popular mayor and you can't please everyone. I support Matthew because he was elected by the people.""
Falling in Reverse's tour website states its December United Kingdom tour had been postponed due to Radke's visa application being rejected.
UK rules state applicants who have spent more than 12 months in prison could be refused entry.
In 2008, Radke went to prison following an altercation that led to the death of a man in Las Vegas.
Ronnie Radke, who has said ""maybe I shouldn't have showed up with brass knuckles to a fight, but I didn't murder anybody"". (Facebook: Ronnie Radke)
Media reports, and Radke himself, have stated that Radke and an accomplice went to a fight and the accomplice shot the man.
""My friend got self-defence,"" Radke explained in a video.
""I'm the only one who got a charge, months later, for having brass knuckles on me.
""I pleaded from two felonies to one felony, two felonies being possession of a dangerous weapon/concealing a dangerous weapon, to one felony — battery, which never happened.
""I never hit anybody — I just pled to one felony.
In the video, he also hit out at the outrage over an incident where he injured someone at a New Jersey music festival by throwing microphone stands into the crowd.
Media reports state he injured two people and was charged with assault and aggravated assault.
""I threw some mic stands into a crowd. OK, I injured somebody — stupid, right?"" he said.
Radke has also faced a domestic violence charge.
A Los Angeles court document states the charges of domestic violence and false imprisonment were dismissed due to a plea negotiation. Radke served 24 months' probation on the remaining charge of disturbing the peace.
Responding to questions from the ABC, Cr Garwood said in a statement he attended the Falling in Reverse concert in Adelaide on a personal trip and no council funds were used.
""I attended the concert in a personal capacity as a music fan, not as an official representative of the City of Launceston,"" he said.
Cr Garwood says while he admits ""I know I do things differently"" he also remains committed to representing ""all residents of Launceston"". (ABC News: Morgan Timms)
He acknowledged concerns raised by some community members about allegations against Radke.
""My attendance at the concert was solely as a fan of music, and my interactions with Radke were brief and focused on music and performance.
""I appreciate that people may have differing views on this, and I respect those perspectives. My intent is never to cause concern or upset members of the community.",ABC News,music
Two new plays show disability representation is improving but theatre still has a long way to go,Hannah Diviney,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-20/disability-roles-in-theatre-hannah-diviney-bridie-mckim/105060124,"As a young kid growing up with cerebral palsy, I never saw anyone who looked like me represented in the mainstream media. Not on TV or in film, in books I read, games I played or toys available on shelves.
When I did eventually start seeing characters that represented something of my experience as a wheelchair user, they were more often than not played by able-bodied actors who wore disability like a costume and got praised for the level of physical, emotional and psychological transformation required.
Hannah Diviney is an activist, author and AACTA-Award-nominated performer. (Supplied)
In recent years, that phenomenon has slowly shifted thanks to tireless campaigning from advocates, changes in production values and in the platforming of disabled performers.
One place that's remained stubbornly resistant to that progress, however, is the theatre.
It still blows my mind for example, that in 22 years of the musical Wicked being performed on stages around the world, there has never been a disabled actor — not one — cast in the role of Nessarose Thropp, despite the fact she's always been a disabled character.
But this year, two disabled actors are reinventing classic characters, challenging audience perceptions and taking the opportunity to try to even-up the representation scales.
When Liam Gamble strides across theatre company Sport for Jove's rehearsal space, I can see why he's playing a king.
Gamble takes on Richard III, Shakespeare's conniving anti-hero, hell-bent on gaining power, in The Player Kings, transposing Shakespearean language, drama and tragedy onto a political epic.
The cast of The Player Kings, with Gamble third from left (seated). ""It's been great to finally sink my teeth into Richard,"" he says.
It's a role, Gamble says ""he absolutely had to have"" when he heard about it.
""Literally the day before this audition brief came through, I was lying on my bed asking the universe to give me an opportunity because, you know, as disabled actors, we don't get them as easily.""
Although the disabilities between Gamble and Richard the III's character are different, they hold striking points of similarity, which Gamble has been able to put to spectacular use to slide into villain mode.
His otherwise gentle face sets into an almost rictus snarl as he stomps and bellows, every inch of his 180-centimetre frame drawn into an imposing shape.
Gamble shifts into multiple roles in the production, as Richard III doesn't show up until the last of the play's eight acts.
This means he plays characters who haven’t necessarily been thought of as disabled, but are in this production, simply because of the actor playing them.
It reflects a trend of disability not necessarily being the focal point of the narrative, that Gamble and I both hope to see continue.
Bridie McKim shares the same hope, as she takes on the storied character of Laura Wingfield in Tennessee Williams' semi-autobiographical play, The Glass Menagerie (her character is based on his sister).
The play has been a staple of theatre stages since the 1940s.
McKim is known for her roles in TV shows Bump (2021) and The Heights (2019). (Supplied: Prudence Up)
Written as having a somewhat ambiguous physical disability, Laura has historically been interpreted and performed as someone meek and mild, without a lot of agency or spark.
McKim remembers watching a performance of the play when she was 15. It deeply distressed her.
""I recall bursting into tears and being so upset by it because she was played in such a way where she had no autonomy and no courage … [She] was kind of cowardly. And while I know everyone's different, that is not my experience of what it's like to have a disability.""
This regional theatre company has become one of Australia’s leading performing arts exports, all by making work that defies expectations.
For the record, it's not mine either, although I have at times felt robbed of my agency or anxious about taking up space in the world.
It's why I perform — this way, I get to control the story and be what I never saw.
Case in point: when I quietly suggest to McKim that her performance as Laura might inspire and empower a 15-year-old girl in the audience this time, we both get a little emotional.
She's determined to play Laura with a more fire and sass than the version she first encountered, as the kind of woman who will resonate with 2025 audiences.
There's progress, but there's much further to go for disabled representation.
In 2023, Screen Australia research showed that while there'd been an increase in the representation of disability in Australian TV and online dramas — 6.6 per cent, up from 3.6 per cent in 2016 — disability representation remained ""critically low"".
As McKim puts it: ""We represent 20 per cent of the population. Let us take up 20 per cent of the jobs.""
Sounds good to me.

"The impact of But I'm a Cheerleader, starring Natasha Lyonne and RuPaul, 25 years on",By Rachel Rasker,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-02/but-i-m-a-cheerleader-at-25/104967056,"Made by community for community, But I'm a Cheerleader has become one of the most iconic queer films of all time.
It could have gone terribly wrong — media executives could have become overly involved, toning down the project until it was palatable for mainstream audiences and the male gaze.
And yet, this campy, irreverent film set in a conversion camp was somehow greenlit in 1999, and enjoyed a cinematic release in Australia by 2000, premiering at the Mardi Gras Film Festival.
25 years on, But I'm a Cheerleader remains a beloved re-watch for queers both in Australia and globally.
To explore its cross-generational impact, we spoke with Alice Maio Mackay — a 20-year-old trans filmmaker from Kaurna/Adelaide, who's behind a string of horror flicks, including T Blockers — and Kate Jinx, an ""older millennial"", programmer at the Melbourne International Film Festival, and the co-host of the See Also podcast, which featured an episode on the modern classic.
But I'm a Cheerleader follows the life of preppy blonde teen Megan, played by honorary queer Natasha Lyonne, who is sent to a conversion camp to make her ""normal"" after her friends and family accuse her of being a lesbian.
The cult comedy, which also stars the actually gay Clea Duvall, has been heralded as a ""sea change"" for queer cinema in the 21st century, and is widely regarded as ahead of its time.
The film's impressive cast includes Cathy Moriarty, Michelle Williams, Bud Court, New Zealand's Melanie Lynskey and even a young RuPaul out of drag. (Lionsgate)
Many other LGBTQA+ films of the era told soul-crushing stories of repressed sexuality and the AIDS crisis, or featured straight actors ""playing gay"" for a mainstream audience.
Instead, But I'm a Cheerleader poked fun at heteronormativity and gender roles, taking dark themes of homophobia, social isolation and conversion therapy and turning them into a candy-coloured romantic romp.
For Jinx, who watched the film as a 20-year-old from Sydney's Western suburbs, the film was ""hugely influential"".
""A lot of what I was watching and dealing with were quite sad portrayals [of queer life],"" she says.
""The tragic lesbian is such a thing, and I felt like everything was so loaded, but this film had so much life and energy and lightness and a great soundtrack … it really blew me away.""
Since But I'm a Cheerleader and Heavenly Creatures, Melanie Lynskey has become known for Yellowjackets and countless other roles. (Lionsgate)
She had a friend who worked at their local cinema, who would let Jinx and her housemate enjoy back-to-back viewings.
""We would watch the film and then wait 15 minutes, and then it would start again.""
For Maio Mackay, who first watched the film as a 12-year-old exploring the tantalising world of SBS content, it's But I'm a Cheerleader's expert handling of light and shade that makes it so special.
Cathy Moriarty's Mary Brown ran True Directions with her ""straight"" son, Rock, played by Eddie Cibrian. (Lionsgate)
True Directions is a 1950s-style world, where girls vacuum and wear plastic pink dresses, and boys play with toy guns among phallic blue trees. RuPaul, who's an ""ex-gay"" camp counsellor, preaches about masculinity while wearing a ""Straight is Great"" T-shirt.
As Maio Mackay says, it's ""not a grounded film"".
""It's very satirical and colourful and campy and it's not like the real world.
""But at the same time, there's some sad and pretty shitty stuff that happens … we see these characters go through it but [because] it is such a vibrant world, it's still a fun watch.""
Jinx agrees the film is rooted in truth; director Jamie Babbit's mother even ran a rehabilitation centre called New Directions, albeit for drug addiction.
""Even though it comes off as this pastel-coloured confection, there's so much honesty in there too,"" Jinx says.
At its time of release, But I'm a Cheerleader was widely panned by reviewers, many of whom were straight men who misunderstood the film's humour, or who were scandalised by its focus on queer love and belonging.
But there was backlash from the LGBTQA+ community too, especially from the generation who'd lived through the AIDS crisis and didn't think it appropriate to laugh at topics such as homophobia.
But I'm a Cheerleader, a silly, irreverent film about conversion therapy, also has plenty of heart. (Lionsgate)
Over time, attitudes have changed, as has our understanding of gender and sexuality.
There's a character in the film who's implied to be a transgender man, however this isn't overtly explored, and they're mostly just the butt of the joke.
""It's not the greatest representation of all time,"" Maio Mackay says.
""But it's a product of its time and it still meant a lot to see a character like that when I was younger, when there weren't a lot — there still isn't a lot — of that kind of thing in the media.""
The film's tender portrayal of female love and desire has also kept it relevant to modern teens, including a sex scene the director had to fight for.
And Clea Duvall's soft butch character, Graham, clearly intended for the queer female gaze, has captured the imagination of a whole new generation.
TikTok today is full of horny Graham edits, with Gen Zs expressing their love for the film through sexualised montages of her character, as well as more generalised tributes and cosplays, all backed by a soundtrack of modern pop hits.
While many members of But I'm a Cheerleader's cast have gone on to have mammoth careers in the two and a half decades since the film's release, it's a project they're still frequently asked about; Natasha Lyonne and Melanie Lynskey recently reunited for Variety's Actors on Actors series.
The film was adapted into a stage musical in 2005, premiering at the New York Musical Theatre Festival, with a 2022 London production of the same script winning WhatsOnStage's Best Off-West End Production.
It's unclear if pop superstar Chappell Roan's cheerleading bop Hot To Go! was inspired by the film, but she is evidently a fan.
MUNA and Phoebe Bridgers's gay anthem, Silk Chiffon, made a more direct homage in its music video, with band members playfully re-enacting scenes and characters.
On an individual level, But I'm a Cheerleader has had a personal impact on many in the queer community, including trans actor Elliot Page, who credited it with changing his life.
Page brought up the film while receiving an award at Outfest film festival: ""We don't talk enough about how important representation is and … how many lives it saves.""
For Jinx, the film has been ""such a touchstone"" in her life.
""It was the kind of film I wanted to show everyone … it's those sorts of films that make you want to go into film curation and programming because it's all about connecting with people and creating dialogues.""
For Maio Mackey, the way the movie blends queerness with comedy influenced her own style of twisting the transgender experience through horror.
""A lot of people my age and a lot of people I work with really love the film and the story and how it's told.
""For any film made 25 years ago … I think that's pretty special.""

Rachel Kushner on the story behind her Booker-shortlisted spy novel Creation Lake,Hannah Story,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-15/rachel-kushner-creation-lake-the-mars-room-booker-shortlist/104990582,"In 2008, police raided a commune in Corrèze, rural France, where they alleged ""anarchists"" were conspiring to sabotage the country's railways.
A decade later, the group — mostly young people, choosing to live simply and communally — were acquitted of most charges and a secret agent who had infiltrated their group had been exposed.
""There were things about [the case] that seemed ready-made for fictionalising,"" says American writer Rachel Kushner, who first met members of the commune, Tarnac, when visiting France about 20 years ago.
Creation Lake, the latest novel from Kushner — the author of the Booker-shortlisted The Mars Room — does just that.
Kushner was inspired by the 70s crime novels of French author Jean-Patrick Manchette: ""I borrowed from Manchette the idea of the narrator as an agent of destruction.""

  (Supplied: Penguin Books Australia)
It's the story of ""Sadie"", a disgraced former FBI agent who now works as a spy for hire. She travels to rural France to infiltrate eco-activist commune Le Moulin while at the same time keeping tabs on a local politician.
As Kushner told ABC Radio National's Claire Nichols at Adelaide Writers' Week, the real commune was also infiltrated by a secret agent from the UK police. When the commune found his fake passports in his car, they confronted him.
""Apparently he started to cry, and he said, 'I've come over to your side' … Because they were nice people, they let him go instead of beating the crap out of him.
He was fired from the police for misconduct, and wound up working as a spy for an American military contractor.
Kushner took hold of a particular lesson in his story: ""There is life for these people after they are disgraced"". She used it to create her novel's ""malicious"" narrator, Sadie.
It took Kushner three years to find the right character to narrate Creation Lake.
""You can have milieu and texture and even scenes and characters, but if you don't have one organising mind, it's really hard to write a book,"" she says.
She didn't want a narrator like herself — a writer ""sympathetic to the social project of leaving the city and moving to the country"".
""If there's a problem with a book, the problem is not the idea and the theme, the problem is with me and my approach to it,"" Kushner said at Adelaide Writers' Week. (Supplied: Penguin/Chloe Aftel)
The only ""transformation"" for a character like that would be becoming disillusioned with the political project of the commune — a story she knew was all too common from speaking to people who lived at Tarnac.
""People went to the commune to try to be a part of it, and everybody ended up leaving, feeling like, 'Oh, I was excluded,' or 'The leader's an asshole,'"" she says.
""There's always some reason why things don't work out. It's really hard to figure out how to collectivise labour and live together with other people.""
Guiding the commune as they try to work out how to do those things is Bruno Lacombe. He's a teacher-turned-philosopher who lives in a cave, emerging only to write lengthy emails about the lives of Neanderthals.
Kushner, who toured Australia this month for Adelaide Writers' Week and All About Women festival in Sydney, says Bruno is the ""beating heart"" of the novel.
""He believes that if you treat people with dignity and softness, they likely will be able to reflect and even generate those attributes,"" she says.
Kushner realised her narrator could be reading Bruno's emails, searching for information about Le Moulin's plans. It helped her find the voice of Sadie.
""She's there to effectively destroy [the commune members'] lives,"" Kushner says.
That malicious intent meant Sadie's narrative arc wouldn't be about disillusionment. Instead, ""[She could] go from experience and cynicism towards something like innocence.""
Sadie moves towards innocence as she becomes enthralled by Bruno and his lofty ideals.
His character is loosely inspired by a real philosopher: Jacques Camatte, who Kushner heard lived in a cave and sent long emails.
""I thought: 'That's a fascinating contradiction,'"" Kushner says. ""And I immediately came up with my own version of Camatte.""
It seemed natural, she says, that a figure like Bruno would be thinking about how to re-organise social life by looking at the past ""to see if earlier versions of humans left any clues for us"".
That search leads him to mostly live in the subterranean caves of Corrèze and, in writing about his living conditions, Kushner drew on the knowledge of her teenage son, an avid spelunker and cave guide.
""I don't like to go deep into caves,"" Kushner says.
""[But] I had this sense of what Bruno's underground world would be like … [because my son] tells me what he finds down there: he's had to wade through neck-deep water and shimmy through spaces that are so narrow you can't turn your head.""
Bruno poses questions Kushner often thinks about. In Creation Lake, Bruno writes: ""We are headed toward extinction in a shiny, driverless car, and the question is: How do we exit this car?""
Kushner says: ""On any given day, it's too much to ask that question … It's painful.
""We're all conditioned to normalise this state where we just have disposability casually raining down on us all the time. It's like, 'Oh, just throw that thing away and get a new one,' or 'There's a new operating system,' or 'Technology is going to get us out of this bind.'
""Or [it's like] nothing matters. Now, it's just 'right-wing accelerationism' — the whole idea that we just colonise Mars and leave this place behind.""
Kushner, pictured at All About Women, isn't interested in writing autofiction: ""I always want some more hallucinogenic wrapping around the reality of the book; something that's like this world, but a little different."" (Supplied: Sydney Opera House/Cassandra Hannagan)
But, like Bruno, Kushner believes in human goodness — and that life is ""holy and blessed"".
Asking questions about human existence in the novel was ""a bizarrely healing experience"", she says.
By drawing upon her own questions about how to live, Kushner approached Creation Lake like much of her past work: ""Write what you know [and] what you're interested in.""
At Adelaide Writers' Week earlier this month, Kushner spoke on a panel for ABC Radio National's Late Night Live about whether the pandemic led to ""excessive individualism, narcissism, and disconnection"".  (Supplied: Sydney Opera House/Cassandra Hannagan)
Her first novel, 2008's Telex from Cuba, was about the role of Americans in the Cuban Revolution in the 50s; her mum grew up in Cuba in the years before the revolution, near where revolutionary leader Fidel Castro grew up.
Her second, The Flamethrowers (2013), is also concerned with revolutions, taking place in the 70s in both the New York art scene and among the communist Red Brigade group in Rome.
It was inspired partly by Kushner's time living in New York, where she met artists who first moved there in the 70s. But it was also spurred by the anecdotes she heard from people who had participated in Italy's radical political movement of the same period.
""I thought, it's crazy that nobody has written a novel about this,"" she says.
In her 2018 novel, The Mars Room, about a recently incarcerated woman who killed her stalker, she raises issues around failures of carceral justice.
Like Romy in The Mars Room, Kushner grew up in San Francisco with some people who later went to prison. (Supplied: Penguin)
She's long been interested in whether ""society could be better organised than it is right now"".
It's an interest that stems from her childhood, raised by ""deeply unconventional people"", and her younger years spent bartending and racing motorcycles in San Francisco's 90s countercultural scene.
It was seeing indie musician PJ Harvey performing — from 2am until after dawn — that inspired her to finally try to become a writer, at the age of 26.
""I was witness to an artist who wanted to play all night because she was born to do it,"" she writes in an essay collected in her 2021 book, The Hard Crowd.

Frida Kahlo exhibit brings artist's life from Mexico to regional Victoria,Close to 500k Australians could have missed out on savings at the pharmacy,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-08/frida-kahlo-exhibition-bendigo-clothing-blue-house/104930644,"In the family home of iconic artist Frida Kahlo in Mexico City, a colourful Mexican skirt is wrapped delicately in special tissue paper and gently placed into a padded art packing box.
The hand-woven garment is then placed into a protective crate and transported more than 13,000 kilometres away to the Bendigo Art Gallery in Central Victoria.
The clothing has been carefully unboxed ahead of the exhibition's opening next month. (Supplied: Bendigo Art Gallery)
It's rare for these pieces to leave Kahlo's home, now a museum — let alone Mexico.
Any item that leaves Kahlo's former home does so only with the permission of the Mexican government, which makes the latest venture to regional Victoria all the more impressive.
""People will be so moved by her clothing,"" gallery curatorial manager Lauren Ellis said.
""It's every bit as spectacular and colourful as you think, from all those viral images of her, and they're so beautiful of their era.""
It is tipped to be an economic boon for the regional gallery, which has drawn more than 748,000 visitors and generated more than $113 million in economic impact for Greater Bendigo since 2012.
The garments are packed with care before making the 13,612km trip from Mexico City to Bendigo. (Supplied: Bendigo Art Gallery)
Protecting Kahlo's work is increasingly difficult in an era of fast fashion and mass production where her image can be printed on unofficial tote bags, tea towels, mugs and posters.

However, her clothing and jewellery tell the story of a life lived in extremes, and the opportunity to see them up close is unique.
Included among the exhibits are handwoven garments, the sleeves of which are still coloured in paint and cigarette burns, as well as the medical corsets Kahlo wore after spinal surgery, which she hand-painted and embellished while she lay in bed.
The clothing was hidden away in a bathroom in her home, now a museum in her honour, for 50 years at the behest of her husband, muralist Diego Rivera.
He stipulated they must remain locked away until 15 years after his death.
Rivera died in 1957 but the room remained unopened until 2004, when the Frida Kahlo Museum began cataloguing its contents.

""It's a privilege, but also a great responsibility, to take care of and to communicate and share the legacy of Frida Kahlo,"" Frida Kahlo Museum director Perla Labarthe Alvarez said.
Ms Alvarez said she hoped the upcoming exhibition led to a deeper understanding of Kahlo's life and her work as an artist.

The curatorial team at Bendigo Gallery said the exhibit would take guests beyond the pop-culture-driven understanding of Kahlo as an artist.
""It's actually very interesting when you go back to her work and images of her, you realise there's a lot more to her than just the painted face with the flower crown,"" Ms Ellis said.
Kahlo suffered polio as a child, and was also involved in a bus accident that broke her spine in three places at the age of 18.
Her work, mainly self-portraits, celebrates Mexican life, art, and its traditions.
The exhibition in Bendigo will run for four months from March 15.

Picnic at Hanging Rock gains new life thanks to up-and-coming Noongar director Ian Michael,Nicola Heath,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-02-20/director-ian-michael-picnic-at-hanging-rock-stc/104949236,"Few stories are more firmly ingrained in Australian culture than Picnic at Hanging Rock, the tale of three schoolgirls and a teacher from a prestigious college who go missing in the bush in 1900.
The famous story — told in Joan Lindsay's 1967 novel, Peter Weir's 1975 film and Tom Wright's 2016 play — has captured the national imagination for decades.
Ian Michael was working at the Malthouse Theatre box office selling tickets when Wright's adaptation, directed by Matthew Lutton, premiered there in 2016.
The Stage Show brings you in-depth conversations with the world's top directors, performers and writers for the stage.
Nine years later, Michael, a Wilman Noongar actor and director, is bringing the story to a new audience in a Sydney Theatre Company (STC) production.
So, what drew Michael to a work that's already been performed so many times?
""Anytime I direct anything, I always ask myself, 'Why this play? Why this story now?'"" Michael tells Radio National's The Stage Show.
In this case, it was the chance to apply a First Nations lens to a much-loved postcolonial classic.
""Theatre allows us to tell stories but also to reinterpret them and breathe life into familiar narratives,"" he says.

Michael started his career as a theatre kid performing in the local eisteddfod in the coastal WA town of Bunbury.
Performing offered an escape from a childhood that was sometimes traumatic.
At school, he joined the choir, played the clarinet and piano, and appeared in local theatre productions.
Taking on new characters and exploring their worlds ""took me somewhere else"", he says.
""That feeling has never really gone away.""

His grandmother nurtured in him a love of storytelling from an early age.
They'd watch films together and she'd take him to the library when he stayed with her during school holidays.
""She'd give me free rein, and I could pick whatever books I wanted,"" he says.
His grandmother — who arrived in Australia alone from Scotland when she was just 17 — encouraged the young Michael to go after his dreams.
""[She taught me] imagination could lead you anywhere,"" he says.
When Michael finished high school in the mining town of Collie, he moved to Perth to study journalism.
There, a fortuitous conversation with Auntie Lynette Narkle — a respected actor and director working as the university's Aboriginal education officer — set him on a different path.
He told her he was having misgivings about journalism, and she asked him why he hadn't chosen acting instead.
It was a revelatory moment for Michael, who'd always felt that an acting career was unattainable, and he told her he'd think about it.
""Within a week, I dropped out of that course,"" he says.
Combining real-life fears, spooky tropes and Aboriginal spirits, Jon Bell has created a horror movie with a lot of heart.
The following year, he enrolled in the 12-month Aboriginal Performance course at the Western Australian Academy of Performing Arts (WAAPA), whose alumni include The Moogai stars Shari Sebbens and Meyne Wyatt.
""For me, that place was like Disneyland,"" Michael says.
""You're there every single day, nine hours a day, learning the deep basics of what it is to be a performer and a maker.""
He went on to join Perth-based Noongar theatre company Yirra Yaakin and, later, Ilbijerri Theatre Company in Melbourne.
He was making a living as an actor but was yet to score a main-stage role at the likes of the Melbourne Theatre Company or the Malthouse.
""Those were the places that I wanted to be [but] unfortunately, I wasn't seeing people like me on those stages at that time,"" he says.
In 2014, Michael and a friend had a discussion about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in out-of-home care.
It was an issue that infuriated Michael.
""The statistics were so shocking to me. You feel so helpless in those moments, and I thought, 'What can I do? … How do we make sure that people don't forget about the Stolen Generations?'"" he says.
""Because it wasn't a thing that was in the past, it was something that was very much in our present time and continues to be.""
His response ""as an actor, as a maker [and] as an Aboriginal person"" was to turn to the theatre.
He joined forces with fellow theatre-makers Penny Harpham and Seanna van Helten from She Said Theatre to create HART, a one-man show based on the testimonials from the Stolen Generations.

The show — which premiered at the 20-seat Parlour Room at the Melbourne Fringe Festival in 2015 — was a hit.
""We sold out every night,"" Michael says.
HART won three Melbourne Fringe Festival awards — Best Emerging Indigenous Artist and two Tour Ready awards — which enabled Michael to take the show on a sell-out tour around Australia and New Zealand.
Performing HART came with a great sense of responsibility to the survivors of the Stolen Generations, who Michael would often meet in the foyer after the show.
""I can't count the number of times that [people] would come up to me afterwards and say that I was the first person that they told that they were stolen, which was such an incredible thing,"" he says.
It was while working on the script for HART that Michael discovered his father was also a part of the Stolen Generations.
""I was 25 years old, and it was the first time that my dad had told me that him and his siblings were taken from their father,"" he says.
""It was the turning point in my life.""
Sydney Theatre Company’s latest production is a timely reminder of the ""truth and pain"" of the Stolen Generations.
Michael was still touring HART when Clare Watson, then the artistic director of Black Swan Theatre Company in Perth, offered him his first main-stage role in the vampire romance Let the Right One In.
He spent the next four years at Black Swan as a resident artist.
""It was such an incredible time because I was learning so much, so fast,"" he says.
""I was spending a lot of time in rooms watching directors work, and I guess I got bitten by the directing bug.""
Michael made his STC directorial debut in 2023 with a production of British playwright Nick Enright's Constellations.
Before that, he served as associate director to Kip Williams for the acclaimed productions of The Picture of Dorian Gray and Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.
In Picnic at Hanging Rock, Michael wanted to explore the implications of a group of young white women entering a space they weren't meant to be in.

Hanging Rock, a former volcano located 70 kilometres north of Melbourne, is a sacred site for the Dja Dja Wurrung, Woi Wurrung and Taungurung people.
""It was a space for initiation and … transformation. People would be sent up to the rock as children and would come back down as adults, particularly young men,"" Michael says.
""One of the first things I said to [the creative team] was, 'I think the rock swallowed them up'.
In the STC production, Olivia DeJonge, Kirsty Marillier, Lorinda May Merrypor, Masego Pitso and Contessa Treffone play five contemporary schoolgirls who take turns to narrate the story.
As the play progresses, they come to inhabit the characters and act out the narrative themselves.

In Michael's telling, Picnic at Hanging Rock is a story about colonisation.
""I knew straight away that I couldn't tell this story … with five white bodies on stage,"" he says.
Michael draws out the tensions in a colonial narrative set on unceded land, embodied largely by the character of Mrs Appleyard, the school headmistress.
""Mrs Appleyard is the force of colonialism. She is repressing those girls. She's wanting to tame them. She's wanting to control them,"" he says.
Kuungkari and South Sea Islander actor Lorinda May Merrypor delivers a line that strikes Michael every time he hears it: ""Everything is a colony in 1900"".
""For me, that says so much about this production.""

The White Lotus takes film tourism's 'powerful marketing tool' to Thailand,JBy Jessica Riga,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-02-23/the-white-lotus-and-the-immense-value-of-film-tourism/104924748,"The White Lotus has returned, welcoming a fresh batch of addictively awful characters to another lush part of the world where, despite their best efforts, someone always comes home in a body bag.
After stays in Hawaii and Sicily, the third season of Mike White's Emmy-winning social satire anthology takes place in Thailand on the idyllic island of Koh Samui.
With a population of less than 70,000, the island is the latest picture-perfect backdrop for one of the buzziest shows on television.
Thailand will be hoping to ride the wave of film tourism, where travellers book their next holiday based on the locations they see on screen.
And according to experts, it is a powerful marketing phenomenon.
While the White Lotus is a fictional resort, in reality, HBO struck a deal with the Four Seasons last October after using its Maui and Taormina locations for seasons one and two, respectively.
Every season of The White Lotus is set across one week at a luxury resort where dark secrets derail a relaxing holiday. (HBO)
Four Seasons executive vice-president and chief commercial officer Marc Speichert told ABC News the hotel and resort chain observed ""significant interest"" from guests following The White Lotus.
""The growth in visitor numbers has been truly remarkable,"" Mr Speichert said.
""Maui experienced a 425 per cent year-over-year increase in website visits and a 386 per cent increase in availability checks during season one alone.
After the first two seasons of The White Lotus, Expedia saw searches for Hawaii and Sicily each spike 300 per cent, though the travel website did not provide raw numbers.
The third season of Mike White's ""eat the rich"" series jets off to Thailand, introducing a whole host of people you'll want to strangle and locals you'll want to save.
""Destination marketing is vitally important for countries all around the world,"" says Professor Gary Mortimer from the Queensland University of Technology's Business School.
""You only need to think of actual travel shows, which often are funded by a tourism board of a country.
""In any show or doco that profiles a location, particularly the travel, tourism and hospitality elements of it — great bars, amazing resorts, beautiful beaches, fabulous landscapes — it's designed to attract people to that destination.""
Professor Mortimer adds that The White Lotus resonates with ""a particular audience"".
The White Lotus sells Koh Samui as an island paradise — but the whole season was nearly set in Japan.
When producers began location scouting, tourism authorities in Thailand pulled out all the stops to lure the critically acclaimed production to its shores.

Tourism Authority of Thailand executive Siripakorn Cheawsamoot told the ABC last April they were proactive in their attempts to be chosen as the show's latest destination.
""We approached The White Lotus production team and then we talked with them about trying to bring their budget costs down with potential partners,"" Mr Cheawsamoot told the ABC's South East Asia correspondent, Lauren Day.
As fans eagerly wait for a new lot of guests to check into the White Lotus, a behind-the-scenes drama has been unfolding to secure the filming location of the Emmy Award-winning show.
Two kinds of incentives were used to entice the production: cash incentives such as rebates, then ""in-kind incentives"" such as free services.
But one of the biggest drawcards was the Thai government's film incentive program, which offers a cash rebate of up to 20 per cent for foreign film productions.
In 2022, the government waived the personal income tax for foreign talent for five years, meaning the stars of season three would not have paid Thai tax during filming.
According to Associate Professor Monica Chien, a tourism behaviour and destination marketing expert from UQ Business School, Thailand's bid for The White Lotus underscores ""the immense value of film tourism as a strategic tool for destination marketing and economic growth"".
""Film tourism is a multifaceted phenomenon that encompasses a wide range of activities and cultural experiences, all of which can significantly influence a destination's image and drive visitation,"" she told ABC News.
The story, not just the scenery, helps drive film tourism, according to Monica Chien. (HBO)
Traditionally, film tourism involves visits to locations featured in specific films or television shows.
""These include the interplay of landscape, iconic features, narratives and characters, as well as the extent to which the location itself becomes a central character in the story,"" Dr Chien says.
""Film tourism has proven to be a powerful marketing tool, capable of increasing awareness and interest in lesser-known destinations while adding value to already popular tourist hubs like London or New York.
""For instance, I vividly remember my trip to New York 15 years ago, where the first thing I wanted to do was take a guided tour to visit all the iconic locations featured in Sex and the City.
The White Lotus isn't the only show giving viewers finding travel inspiration.
According to Expedia, Ted Lasso prompted a 160 per cent surge for searches for Richmond, the leafy suburb of London, following its second season.
For all its benefits, film tourism can quickly give way to overtourism. (HBO)
Meanwhile, searches for the Scottish Highlands recorded a 190 per cent ramp-up following the second season of The Traitors, compared with data from two years prior.
""The relationship between cinema and tourism is deeply intertwined,"" Dr Chien says.
""When tourists visit film locations, they generate substantial revenue for local businesses, including accommodations, restaurants, tour operators, retail outlets and transportation services.""
Destination marketing is ""vitally important"" for tourism, Gary Mortimer says. (HBO)
Beyond the obvious economic advantages, Dr Chien says several other advantages include enhancing a destination's image, propping up off-season business and reputational management.
But a surge in popularity can quickly give way to overtourism, straining local infrastructure, disrupting communities and degrading the environment.
""Many destinations are unprepared for the sudden influx of tourists driven by the popularity of a specific film or television series,"" Dr Chien says.
One example Dr Chien points to is Thailand's Maya Bay, which was made famous by the film The Beach.
""The surge in tourism following the movie's release led to severe ecological damage, forcing authorities to close the beach for several years to allow the fragile ecosystem to recover,"" she said.
The White Lotus has already been renewed for a fourth season, but no location has been locked in yet. (Supplied: Binge/HBO)
Audiences are only just getting to know the characters of season three, but The White Lotus has already been renewed for a fourth season.
As for where viewers can expect the show to travel to next?
""We're going on some location scouting in the next couple of weeks, so we'll know soon,"" HBO programming executive Francesca Orsi told Deadline.
""I can't really say where we're going to land but chances are, somewhere in Europe.""",ABC News,music
Watching Apple Cider Vinegar filled me with rage and clarity: The answer to Belle Gibson's lies is science,JBy Julia Baird,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-02-20/apple-cider-vinegar-belle-gibson-lies-rage-science/104954630,"It's hard not to watch Apple Cider Vinegar without experiencing a slow boiling rage.
Rage at cancer patients shouting at doctors and (fatally) refusing their advice, rage at con-artists pretending to be ill in order to garner a following and monetise the misery of others, rage at the continual elevation of quackery, of false cures and false hopes and rage at those who purvey and profit from expensive, unevidenced treatments that can make people sicker.
If you have somehow missed the story, Belle Gibson was a young influencer and app-creator who lied about having cured herself from brain cancer she never actually had with food and alternative therapies. She developed a successful ""wellness"" brand, advocated against conventional medical treatments and purported to raise money for charities — little of which she ever passed on.
In 2015 she finally admitted ""none of it is true"".
Vanity Fair called her ""one of the most hated women in Australia"".
Few things incite headlines as quickly as a fraudulent female fantasist and, years after the Federal Court found Gibson guilty of engaging in misleading and deceptive conduct, and fined her $410,000, her story continues to be told.
A new Netflix series, Apple Cider Vinegar, picks a sticky way through her webs of deception, trying to explain how it all happened, fathom how so few questioned her, and highlight the dangers of lack of interrogation of such claims (in short: people die).
The series, which Netflix says is a ""true-ish story, based on a lie"", also features a character based on wellness blogger Jess Ainscough who sought alternative therapies for cancer (as well as medical treatments) but sadly died at 29. Her family is furious at her false depiction as a rival to Gibson.
Now, another a documentary titled Dangerous Lies: Unmasking Belle Gibson involves further head-scratching.
I rocketed down a rabbit hole after watching the series, as I suspect others have too.
First, the original articles by the journalist who broke the story, Richard Guilliatt, who has queried its accuracy and called it an ""over-caffeinated, pop-soundtracked caricature … a drama about a real-life compulsive liar, told with little regard for the truth"". Having been written out of the story, Guilliatt suggests it's a ""bit rich"" that his own wife's breast cancer was ""grafted onto"" the plot line, connected to a fictional journalist.
Then I found myself looking at Ainscough's Instagram, and that of her partner, whose heartbroken posts are interspersed with his finding new love, and was cheered by his recent marriage. I went back and watched the 60 Minutes interview with Tara Brown and saw in Gibson the face of a woman accustomed to lying, to employing loopholes of language, basting in her own contradictions as Brown turned her on a spit of accountability.
So what does all this mean for cancer patients?
The level of public loathing for Gibson has become so high and feverish that one 29-year-old woman who has terminal stage four bowel cancer — Kellie Finlayson, a mother and the wife of a Port Adelaide AFL player — says that she has been compared to Gibson ""countless times, several times a week"", which is ""a big punch to the face"".
""It's kicking me while I'm down,"" she told one reporter, but she believes people are doing it because she has sought alternative therapies and often looks well despite her illness.
""Being called this woman's name is offensive — it's abusive almost,"" Finlayson said. ""Having gone through the things that she described … or pretended to have gone through and the way she manipulated people around her to empathise and to give her so much … it makes me physically ill.""
I also can't help but feel concerned about one aspect of having cancer that seems to have been lost in all of the indignation about Gibson's pathological lies: it can be hellish traversing the medical system sometimes.
I say this whilst sharing this indignation and advocating, at all turns, science.
I have had uncharitable thoughts about people who advised me, after my own cancer diagnosis, to take some concoction that cured their Aunty Beryl, to drink vats of cucumber juice or to just think positively, which one woman I met claimed sorted her cancer right out.
If there was legitimate research finding sleeping with crystals nestling in our armpits would prevent or shrink tumours, we'd all do it, night after night.
But the answer is not to patronise or dismiss as mad cancer patients who seek gentler, less stressful routes. If we want to avoid the potentially fatal sway of canny fabulists like Gibson, the answer is not to ridicule patients but to elevate science, to put more money into cancer research.

Let me say baldly, I have had recurrent cancer and I have dutifully followed everything my doctors have told me to do. But I'm fully aware that it is a rare type, and under-researched, so much of the treatment guess-work. Smart guess work, done by smart people based on the available science. Which is why I have followed it.
But like many, I have had bad experiences too. My usual surgeon is brilliant, dogged, and exceptionally hard working. I am indebted to her. But I once consulted, and trusted, another surgeon, who ended up being contradictory and dismissive once his proposed treatment failed.
After my last appointment with him, I was so shocked by his blunt, almost cavalier approach that I struggled to sleep for several months — as did my friend who came with me. It was a truly awful and avoidable experience that made me wonder if we are doing enough to equip medical professionals to deal with the mental pain and uncertainty of chronic illness.
Medical staff can say incredibly insensitive things; people can get lost in the whirr of machines, the pinging of MRI lasers, the draining of blood, the pricks of cannulas.
This is often why people who are desperately ill turn elsewhere — because it can be so hard to grasp what you are going through, because few of us have sufficient medical knowledge or scientific understanding to be able to comb through academic journals and be satisfied about the correct route to take. Because it can be bewildering and overwhelming and sometimes the cleverest of doctors can be the worst communicators.
People don't refuse treatment just because they don't want to cut off an arm — as was suggested in Ainscough's case — but because they don't understand the complexity and uncertainty and, especially for those with rarer diseases, the gaps in research. Because they seek some semblance of control and fear the pain and toxicity of treatment.
American actor Kaitlyn Dever talks about finding the good beneath the surface of Belle Gibson, and the rise of the wellness industry.
The story of Belle Gibson is an important one, and it should be widely known for several reasons: so that we might avoid snake oil, challenge misinformation, question bogus medical claims, recognise what ignoring medical science might mean, and — allow me this — also witness the importance of good, properly funded investigative journalism. As well as shoddy journalism, of course — those who platform people claiming to have unproven miracle cures without demanding evidence.
In an era of increasing distrust of science, medicine and vaccines, we urgently need scientists and doctors who can communicate effectively. We also need to understand the root causes of that distrust, rational or otherwise, if we are to save lives from destructive ""self-healing"". We need to ensure people trust their doctors.
But let's not be distracted by simply fixating on a group of women who people seem to love to hate — pretty female influencers — and ensure we keep the medical system accountable too. So much remains unknown about so many cancers; no funding can go to waste.

Israeli police raid Palestinian family-run East Jerusalem bookshop for the second time in a month,Matthew Doran,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-12/israeli-police-raid-palestinian-run-bookshop-for-second-time/105039850,"Israeli police have raided a family-run Palestinian bookshop in East Jerusalem for the second time in a month, confiscating more than 50 books and briefly arresting the owner.
The Educational Bookshop is a literary haven in the city selling a wide variety of titles discussing the Israeli-Palestinian relationship and Middle East culture.
Supporters of the Muna family, who run the store, have said it is being targeted as part of a crackdown on freedom of speech and expression by Israeli authorities.
On Tuesday morning Israel Police arrived at the store, not far from the walls of Jerusalem's Old City, and arrested its owner Imad Muna.
Police seized books from the shelves, going so far as to ask Imad's wife Najwa for plastic bags to help carry what they had claimed was evidence against him.
CCTV shows almost a dozen police searching the store, with one heavily armed officer standing guard on the street outside.
Mr Muna's brother Murad said police did not present a search warrant as they entered the store and ordered it to close.
""Najwa tried to go to the bathroom and they pointed their guns at her and started yelling at her, 'Where are you going and what are you doing,'"" Murad told the ABC.
""Then she said she was going to the bathroom.
""They came, opened the door, there was a picture on the wall, they threw the picture on the ground, then they turned on the light and said, 'now, go in.'""
The lawyer for two Palestinian men arrested over books they were selling in their family store says they are being pursued for political reasons.
Israel Police confirmed Imad Muna was released shortly after being taken into custody.
""The Israel Police received a report from a caller who stated that he had observed books containing inciting content at a bookstore in Jerusalem,"" police told the ABC in a statement.
""Upon arrival at the scene, officers seized three books and temporarily detained an individual present at the location to verify his identity and the details of the store.
""Following the verification process, the individual was released.
""The police have initiated a review of the books, and based on the findings, a determination will be made on whether to refer the matter to the State Attorney's Office for further investigation into the suspected sale of inciting materials.""
Among the books seized but returned are titles by British street artist Banksy, American author Noam Chomsky and Israeli historian Ilan Pappé.
Two of the three books police kept are Footnotes in Gaza, by journalist and cartoonist Joe Sacco and Israel and the Clash of Civilisation, by British writer Jonathan Cook.
Murad told the ABC the family believed they knew who had called the police, and that the man could be seen on CCTV visiting the store about an hour before the officers arrived.
""He came to Najwa half an hour before [the police arrived] and opened the book of Joe Sacco, 'Footnotes in Gaza',"" Murad said.
""And he saw a picture of children with blood on their hands, and he asked Najwa what was this picture.
""She said to him 'this is a picture of when they slaughter a lamb following the construction of a new home and people put the blood on their hands and then paint the walls.' It's a ritual/tradition that people do in the world.'
""And then he said to her, 'Now I understand why they raided you the last time.' And then he left.""
Murad said the man spoke English and was carrying a camera with a long lens.
In February Mahmoud and Ahmed Muna, Imad's brother and son, were arrested and charged with breaching the peace by selling books with Palestinian themes and imagery.
One of the books sparking concern was a children's colouring in book titled 'From the River to the Sea', which is a Palestinian resistance phrase.
After two nights in custody, the pair were released.
Ahmed described the latest raid as ""heartbreaking.""
""For me this time it was even harder than last time when I was arrested,"" he said.
""But this time, I had to see my mum and dad being humiliated by them.
""They were only two police, and then two more arrived, and then two more undercover, and then two more undercover.
""They made a whole scene, you know? They closed the road, they drover against the traffic. They were coming as if it were an emergency.
""They came in cars from all corners, and then more undercover police came and more undercover police came. We ended up with 10 people in the shop.""
He said it was a concerning development.

The first raid in February prompted outcry from members of the expat community in Jerusalem, labelling it as an attack on freedom of speech, and a number of foreign diplomats had packed into one of the city's small courtrooms to show their support for the family and watch the court proceedings unfold.
Israel's State Prosecutor had criticised police's actions in the weeks after the bungled raid, saying officers had not requested an investigation be launched into alleged incitement offences before the arrests were made — something required under Israeli law.

Snow White is a great trailer for Disney's original animated masterpiece,By Luke Goodsell,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-21/snow-white-review-gal-gadot-rachel-zegler-disney/105060984,"Heigh-ho! Undeterred by cultural indifference, Disney's decade-long mission to remake their classic animation catalogue marches on.
And yes, after much delay, they've arrived at the fairest title of them all: the widely beloved Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
What: A live-action remake of Disney's classic animated feature, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Starring: Rachel Zegler, Gal Gadot, Andrew Burnap
Director: Marc Webb
When: In cinemas now
Likely to make you feel: Entertained — if you're in the single digits
Not only was that 1937 film the studio's very first feature, and the standard-setter for all that was to come but, adjusted for inflation, it remains the highest-grossing animated movie of all time — bigger than Frozen, bigger than The Lion King, more popular than anything Pixar ever produced.
That's a lot of pressure on this live-action remake, which is directed by Marc Webb (The Amazing Spider-Man; 500 Days of Summer) and stars Rachel Zegler and Gal Gadot as the feuding fairytale royals.
Like so many of the Mouse House's recent remakes, it's a no-win situation: stick too close to the original and it becomes a pointless retread; deviate from the classic text and risk incurring the wrath of everyone with an axe to grind.
In the case of the latter, the new movie already seemed doomed. Beyond the usual racist bores crying foul over the lead casting, there was Zegler's presumably disparaging comment about the cherished original, the matter of Gadot's hot-button political allegiance, and controversy over resurrecting a story that embraces outdated depictions of dwarfism. Talk about a magic mirror for the moment.
""I feel so lucky that I got to play something that is so far from what I know and what I'm used to, and I super, super enjoyed every second of it,"" Gal Gadot told Variety. (Supplied: Disney)
Of course, Disney's original feature took its own liberties with the Brothers Grimm fairytale on which it was based, so there's room for all kinds of retelling — the more radical, one might argue, the better.
Both an enhanced musical and a fleshed-out narrative, the 2025 version opens with more or less business as usual: having lost her royal parents, erstwhile princess Snow White (Zegler) has been relegated to palace servant under the tyranny of the vain Evil Queen (Gadot), who rules the once-utopian land with a bejewelled claw and sentient looking glass.
Prince Charming, the original Disney hunk, is nowhere to be found, however — or at least, he's been reconfigured as Jonathan (Andrew Burnap), a Robin Hood-like bandit who Snow White catches stealing potatoes in the royal scullery.
There's a flicker of, well — not exactly true love, but a shared interest in the redistribution of wealth. How romantic.

Once Snow White flees the Huntsman (Ansu Kabia) and stumbles upon the cottage of the seven — what should we call them, magic little men? — well, things start to get weird.
In Disney's typically disingenuous fashion, the movie never once mentions the D-word, but in every other respect Doc, Grumpy, Dopey and co. replicate the caricature appearance of their cartoon counterparts — only this time, using disconcerting CGI.
In place of simply using actors with real-life dwarfism, these photo-realistic digital creations are deeply unsettling, not unlike those real-life renderings of Simpsons characters. The whole thing is made even more odd by the fact that there are flesh-and-blood dwarf actors in the bandit crew.
""The filmmakers have taken such good care of this timeless classic,"" Zegler told The Movie Report. (Supplied: Disney)
Such hedging of bets is a familiar strategy of the Disney remake machine, eager to look progressive but wary of offending anyone. The result is a curiously benign film that isn't lacking for ideas, but whose execution is diluted — the bind of putting shareholders ahead of art.
Resurfaced comments made by actress Rachel Zegler about her upcoming film Snow White spark outrage online.
At the same time, there's plenty to admire here — and a younger audience, especially one unfamiliar with the many incarnations of the fable, will likely have a pretty good time.
Zegler, who broke through in Steven Spielberg's West Side Story and carried the surprisingly enjoyable reboot of the Hunger Games, brings a flinty exuberance to the title role, even as her theatre-kid vocals exist in another universe to the quaint music of the 1937 movie.
Her singing lights up the classic 'Whistle While You Work' and the newly created 'Waiting on a Wish', the latter one of the original songs by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul (2019's Aladdin). It's a standard, post-Wicked musical playbook, albeit with a couple of memorable additions. 'Princess Problems', a duet between Burnap and Zegler, generates Han and Leia sparks, while 'All is Fair' provides the Queen with a dastardly vamp — although let's just say that Gadot's singing gives her acting a run for its money.
The movie could probably do without the extra verses crow-barred into 'Heigh-Ho' — still one of the Mouse House's all-time bangers — or the antic rollercoaster sequence that accompanies it, which seems to exist as a not-too-subtle plug for a Disneyland ride. Less is more with the little guys, whose slapstick gets weary, and whose sentimentality is even worse.
Snow White is at its best when it manages to find its own groove, when it sticks to its revisionist guns and explores the relationship between its heroine — and her growing awareness of the Queen's injustice — and its scrappy hero.
Gal Gadot told Jimmy Fallon she was very nervous to say the iconic line: ""Magic mirror on the wall, who is the fairest of them all?"" (Supplied: Disney)
When the people's princess finally storms the palace with an army of peasants who look like they've migrated from a production of Les Mis, the movie achieves a kind of gravity and power, however redolent of #resist-era girl-bossing it may be.
Like most of the Disney remakes, though, nothing about this will be remembered a century — or even a year — from now, despite it being a perfectly serviceable movie on its own terms.
There are many reasons why the likes of the original Snow White, Pinocchio and Fantasia linger in the cultural memory, but one of them is that their magic — and their darkness — is impossible to replicate in today's filmmaking culture.
As ever, the new version makes a great trailer for the original.

Maud Page becomes first woman to be appointed director of Art Gallery of New South Wales,Hannah Story,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-21/art-gallery-of-nsw-director-maud-page-michael-brand/105082770,"Maud Page has been announced as the next director of the Art Gallery of New South Wales (AGNSW), the first woman to lead the state institution in its 154-year history.
""To be the first woman is pretty fantastic,"" Page tells ABC Arts.
Page, who is currently the gallery's deputy director and director of collections, takes on the role next week, replacing Michael Brand, who resigned in October, after 13 years at the helm. She is only the 10th director in the gallery's history.
Page partly attributes the 154-year wait for a woman to lead the gallery to the long tenures of former directors, including Edmund Capon, who ran the gallery for more than 33 years.
Page has worked at AGNSW since 2017, after previously working as deputy director and senior curator of Pacific art at the Queensland Art Gallery/Gallery of Modern Art (QAGOMA) in Brisbane, and as a lecturer in museum studies at the University of Sydney.
Her appointment as director follows a marked shift in the number of women leading state galleries across Australia.
According to the second Countess Report, released in 2019 and charting the period 2014–18, only 12.5 per cent of the director or CEO-level roles at state galleries were held by women. By 2024, with the release of the third report, charting 2018-22, that number had improved to 50 per cent.
Page also notes in the past it was rare to see internal candidates considered for the top job.
Early media speculation raised Page as a potential frontrunner, as well as Lisa Slade from the Art Gallery of South Australia, and international candidates Melissa Chiu from the Smithsonian's Hirshhorn Museum in the US, and Australian Suhanya Raffel from M+ in Hong Kong.
""People coming in from the outside are always shinier, and I know that the competition was fierce,"" Page says.

Particularly so because of the gallery's status among art-lovers worldwide: it's in the world's top 30 most visited art museums.
""It's an institution that's just opened a new building,"" she says. ""We've got an incredible collection, such a great staff base … So, I knew [the directorship] would be really, really contested. I had to really work very hard at it.""
As the leader of AGNSW, Page wants to emphasise the ""transformative power"" of art.
""I really do think that museums and galleries are social spaces, and I really believe in the civic nature of institutions,"" she says.
""I would just love for more people to use it in that way, so that people can walk through our threshold and really see the value of art.""
Page recently worked on the Djamu Youth Justice program, which, since 2017, has seen artists conduct workshops with young people in the justice system in NSW.
""Initially, [the young people] were a bit like, 'Why would we do this?'"" she says.
But by the end of the workshops they were ""experiencing something different and valuing it"".
""Seeing what has happened to those young [people] has been, for me, a life-changing experience. I really love seeing those very real instances where art can make a difference.""
Page's own appreciation of the power of art stems from being taken by her family to galleries and museums when she was growing up. She recalls being amazed by the work of 18th-century French painter Jean-Antoine Watteau, as well as Bull's Head by Picasso — a found object artwork made from a bicycle seat and handlebars.

Now, Page is particularly invested in the work of local artists at all stages of their careers, from emerging to established.
""They're people that are making a difference and that are creating incredible work, aesthetically, subject-wise, materially,"" she says.
""The breadth of our industry is so fantastic; that's what makes it exciting. There's never a dull moment.""
She's particularly excited by the gallery's diversity of spaces — with its new building Naala Badu and its restored neoclassical original building Naala Nura — and how it celebrates both historical and contemporary collections.
She's excited about the way those spaces showcase new work from contemporary NSW artists, for example Archibald-winning Sydney artist Mitch Cairns; or the works of women artists who have been overlooked, such as 83-year-old abstract painter Lesley Dumbrell.

For Page, running a gallery isn't about just ""working with one particular group"".",ABC News,music
