Hip pocket relief finally arrives for millions of Aussie homeowners as RBA cuts rates for the first time since 2020,James Harrison,https://www.skynews.com.au/business/finance/wacth-live-rba-to-reveal-whether-aussies-will-be-delivered-a-much-needed-interest-rate-cut-for-the-first-time-since-2020/news-story/d68b9c246c08e25e382546b729404030,"Aussie mortgage holders have finally been delivered a much-needed rate cut, with the Reserve Bank of Australia lowering interest rates by 0.25 per cent for the first time since 2020.
Join Sky News Australia for all the leading coverage on the RBA’s long-awaited call and breaking news.
The cash rate was held at 4.35 per cent for more than a year as post-pandemic inflation slowly cooled.
That pause came after the RBA hiked rates 13 times from May 2022, over the period of about a year and a half, to stamp out soaring price pressures.
The central bank has now lowered the rate to 4.1 per cent, which could save the average homeowner about $1,200 over the coming 12 months.
All four major banks have now passed on rate cuts to their customers.
Tuesday's decision follows the Australian Bureau of Statistics revealing that trimmed mean inflation – the RBA’s preferred measure which examines the middle 70 per cent of price changes – dropped 0.4 per cent over the final three months of last year.
Annual price increases dropped to 3.2 per cent, this is still outside of the central bank’s two to three per cent target range.
The RBA noted that inflation had eased “a little more quickly than expected”, but added it was still cautiously monitoring future price pressures.
""If monetary policy is eased too much too soon, disinflation could stall, and inflation would settle above the midpoint of the target range,"" the bank said in a statement.
""In removing a little of the policy restrictiveness in its decision today, the Board acknowledges that progress has been made but is cautious about the outlook.""
Sky News' Business Editor Ross Greenwood said this sentiment would ""temper people's expectations"" and pointed to the United States - where rate cuts have slowed.
""You don't want to be like America where you suddenly find yourself having to stall those interest rate cuts or raise interest rates in the future because everybody starts spending and inflation takes off,"" he said.
RBA Governor Michele Bullock reiterated the central bank's caution towards declaring ""victory on inflation"" as price pressures continued to impact Aussies.
""It's not good enough for it to be back in the target range temporarily, the board needs to be confident it's returning to the target range sustainably,"" Ms Bullock told reporters on Tuesday.
She also stressed the decision ""does not imply"" that further rate cuts are coming, as the RBA board would need ""more evidence"" that inflation is continuing to decline.
Market expectations of multiple interest rate cuts in 2025 were ""far too confident"", Ms Bullock stressed, as she told reporters there was uncertainty whether Tuesday's cut is ""one and done"".
She said the board was still concerned about ""upside risks"" from inflation and was waiting to see the economy cool.
""We would need to see easing wage costs,"" Ms Bullock said.
""We need to continue to see the disinflation in market services in particular, we want to see the reduction in housing inflation - we’ve seen it’s sustainable and it’s continuing to come down.""
Treasurer Jim Chalmers said the RBA's rate call was a sign that price pressures had eased from their intense highs.
""Today’s decision and the statement from the Board gives us further confidence that the worst of the inflation challenge is behind us, but we can’t be complacent,"" he said in a statement.
Meanwhile, shadow treasurer Angus Taylor tore into Labor after the rate cut was announced, arguing that the cumulative impacts of post-pandemic inflation had meant Aussies were struggling.
""Despite the welcome cut today, it’s a long journey back to the standard of living Australians had when these interest rates increases began,"" he told reporters.
""We’ve seen 12 interest rate increases under Labor, and one down now, but we’ve also seen the biggest collapse in living standards in our history.""
Trimmed mean inflation has fallen from 6.8 per cent in December 2022, after soaring from the one to two per cent range in the second half of 2021.
The price pressures continue to hurt Aussies in their hip pocket, as the cumulative impacts of post-pandemic inflation mean everyday goods on average cost about 20 per cent more than in 2020.
Louise Southall, an economist at accounting software company Xero, said the rate cut will greatly bolster small businesses through lower borrowing costs and give customers more spending capacity, but also warned the cut itself was not a transformation.
""Rate cuts don't instantly flow through an economy and one rate cut in isolation is unlikely to be sufficient,"" Ms Southall said.
""It can take 18 months to two years for the benefits of lower interest rates to fully pass through.""
Charu Chanana, the chief investment strategist at Saxo, noted that expectations for multiple rate cuts this year should be tapered.
“While disinflation trends have allowed the RBA to start its rate cut cycle, there is still caution on the pace of easing given the tight labour market,” she said.
“The market has been quick to adjust, with one rate cut already pushed out from the RBA expectations curve for this year and only one further rate cut now expected.”
Many major banks and economists shifted their forecasts towards a February rate cut after the December quarter figures were published.
The market had factored in a 91 per cent chance of a drop, while NAB and Westpac both changed their forecasts to a February cut.
Three of the major banks are predicting a full per cent worth of drops throughout the coming 12 months.
Commonwealth Bank of Australia and Westpac both forecast the cash rate to hit 3.35 per cent by December, while NAB said it will hit 3.10 per cent by February.
ANZ is less optimistic than its main competitors, predicting the cash rate will hit 3.85 per cent by August.
Tim Lawless, the research director at analytics firm CoreLogic, said Aussies should not get their “hopes up” for a “a rapid or significant rate cutting cycle in the near term”.
“The RBA is likely to remain alert to the data flows, with persistently tight labour markets, a weak Australian dollar and elevated levels of global uncertainty remaining as downside factors that are likely to keep the loosening cycle a gradual and cautious one,” he said in a statement.",SKY News,finance,"Hip pocket relief finally arrives for millions of Aussie homeowners as RBA cuts rates for the first time since 2020 Aussie mortgage holders have finally been delivered a much-needed rate cut, with the Reserve Bank of Australia lowering interest rates by 0.25 per cent for the first time since 2020.

Coles and Woolworths shares surge after 'benign' report into supermarket sector — as it happened,Stephanie Chalmers,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-21/asx-markets-business-live-news-21-03-25/105079680,"Shares in supermarket giants Coles and Woolworths surged on Friday, as a report into the sector was made public.
Investors seemed to cheer the competition regulator's findings that major grocery chains had increased their margins and that their dominance in the sector was set to continue.
Woolworths shares closed 6.3 per cent higher at $29.93 — its best one-day gain since March 2020.
Coles shares rose 4.9 per cent, while shares in IGA-supplier Metcash gained 3.6 per cent.
""While we do see heightened media publicity around the announcement as likely to negatively impact the supermarkets in the near-term we do not expect a material impact to supermarket earnings from the recommendations,"" Citi analysts said in a note, which called the report ""benign"", according to Reuters.
Senior research analyst Craig Woolford from MST Marquee said investors were breathing a sigh of relief.
""There have been concerns amongst investors there would be significant consequences for the supermarkets.
""While there will be ongoing scrutiny, the ACCC report has concluded that the supermarkets are not responsible for price gouging. The share price response is definitely best described as a 'relief rally'.""
The major supermarkets responded to the report by arguing the Australian grocery market is highly competitive, despite the findings of an oligopoly.
Woolworths said it supported recommendations to improve transparency for buyers and suppliers, and would review the report.
Coles similarly said it would review the recommendations and supported better transparency but cautioned ""against measures that will increase red tape and drive up costs"".
The broader market rose marginally, with the strong performance from consumer stocks offsetting falls the for education, healthcare and technology sectors.
The S&P/ASX 200 gained 0.2 per cent on Friday, leaving it 1.8 per cent higher for the week.
That's the first weekly gain for the benchmark index in more than a month.
Here's how the reaction to the report played out, along with financial news and insights from our specialist business reporters on our blog.

Unless you take meticulous notes of everything you have ever bought at the shops, chances are you've also been impacted by 'shrinkflation'.
The phenomenon refers to a product being downsized when its price either remains the same or increases.
It was a key concern raised by the tens of thousands of consumers surveyed by the ACCC throughout its supermarkets inquiry.
To curb the practice, the regulator has recommended supermarkets be required to publish notifications when shrinkflation occurs.
If you want to learn more about what this involves, read the below piece by Tessa Flemming:

The ASX 200 has closed gained almost 0.2% to close 7,932.10.
It's been a very up-and-down kind of day, with supermarkets lifting the bourse higher.
Coles and Woolworths had some of the biggest gains on Friday, with investors seemingly happy about the ACCC's take on the duopoly's market dominance.
Sector-wise, it was Coles and Woolworths that saw consumer staples finish on top.
Wholesale distribution company Metcash rose 3.6% to $3.19.
Endeavour Group and Graincorp followed suit to gain 2% and 0.4%, respectively
And that's a wrap on markets coverage today.

Steve Ronalds, a co-founder of Victorian milk company Gibson Jersey, criticised major supermarkets for selling milk at a loss to attract customers.
He says retailers offer up discounted products as ""bait to drive in consumers"" by pressuring small suppliers like his to maintain high margins on milk, which then subsidises the cheap milk on supermarket shelves.
""We have to be profitable, and we just can't drop the price. They do ask us to drop the price, or ask how we can supply it cheaper, and we just say we can't,"" he told ABC News.
""Unfortunately consumers are going to have to pay a little bit more if they want to have an Australian industry. Imports are increasing as our local manufacturing is falling off.""
Gibson Jersey says products were removed from 65 Coles stores in Victoria mid-last year for refusing to give the supermarket a bigger profit margin.
Despite being removed from those stores, Ronalds said his sales had increased in independent supermarkets, indicating consumer support for local agriculture
He called for fair milk prices, collective action among suppliers and greater transparency in the industry.

It's been 12 months in the making, but an inquiry into Australia's supermarkets by the competition watchdog has been unable to conclude whether price gouging is taking place.
The federal government directed the ACCC to investigate the country's supermarkets in January last year, following frequent allegations of price gouging during the pandemic and cost-of-living crisis that followed.
But the long-awaited report — the first of its kind in 16 years — declared Australia is home to one of the most profitable supermarket sectors in the world, and Woolworths and Coles don't have a strict duopoly.
Here are the key takeaways from the full 441-page report, and what it means for shoppers at the check-out.

Data from the Australia Bureau of Statistics (ABS) shows 52,800 jobs were lost from the economy in February.
The fall in employment has been attributed to fewer older workers returning to work in February, with employment among older age groups lower than in the same month in 2024.
It raises the bets for an interest rate cut in May, with three of the Big Four banks forecasting one, but that will depend on the next round of quarterly inflation figures due to be released in April.

Coles and Woolies are both up significantly. Was the ACCC report really that good for them?
- Andy Smith
A good question above from reader Andy.
Further from my previous post featuring comments on this from analyst George Boubouras, here is another take on why Coles and Woolworths stocks are rallying today.
Craig Woodford, senior research analyst at MST Marquee, had this to say:
""There have been concerns amongst investors there would be significant consequences for the supermarkets.
While there will be ongoing scrutiny, the ACCC report has concluded that the supermarkets are not responsible for price gouging. The share price response is definitely best described as a 'relief rally'.""
In short, investors reckon the supermarkets have come out the ACCC investigation relatively unscathed.
Currently Coles share price is up 4.5%, to $19.40.
Woolworths has gained 5.5% to $29.72.

Supermarket analyst George Boubouras, managing director of research and investments at K2 Asset Management, has sent through some thoughts on the ACCC's supermarkets report.
He says the ACCC report reinforces that Woolworths and Coles are some of the most profitable supermarkets globally:
""Their margins have fallen however remains high vs global peers which is a key attribute of oligopoly pricing power. Interestingly, the report concluded there is limited evidence of pricing power within the sector. This is clearly very supportive for their share price as some regulatory uncertainty has now been removed.
Despite the increased competition over the past decade, the market share of the major supermarkets still remains one of the highest globally.
Given this persistent market dominance of both COL and WOW, it is difficult to reconcile that this does not lead to “structural” dominance in the sector, from supply chain through to pricing.
The ACCC report is a welcomed report that at the very least keeps the basic concepts of the highly concentrated Australian supermarket sector front and centre for ongoing debate.""
But he says, in the short term, the ACCC report is ""a great result for both COL and WOW given the circumstances. ""
That's because despite the millions spent on investigating supermarket power, as Boubouras points out the ACCC has not produced any concrete or structural findings of wrongdoing. Something Boubouras finds hard to reconcile.
Market dominance, yes. But not much more than that.
Boubouras says the findings on supermarket prices are good news for investors.
Basically, investors are happy about the market dominance, profits and what that means for them as shareholders.

""For decades, America's pharmaceutical giants have been plotting to torpedo Australia's Pharmaceuticals Benefits Scheme (PBS),"" writes our chief business correspondent Ian Verrender.
Twenty years ago, they scored a huge victory when they secured major concessions from the Howard government, as America and Australia negotiated the Australia-US Free Trade Agreement.
Big pharma was at it again during the Obama years when Australia was on the cusp of signing up to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP).
A multilateral trade deal, the TPP was designed to build a regional bloc against China.
Buried in the detail, however, were clauses that quietly entrenched the power of major American corporations.

A survey conducted by Canstar Blue shows 43 per cent of Australians have altered their shopping habits between now and when the ACCC's inquiry into the supermarket sector was announced last January.
Of the 3,000 people asked about their attitudes towards Coles and Woolworths since the probe commenced, 23 per cent said they were more cautious when shopping with both retailers and 17 per cent admitted they were choosing to shop with them less frequently.
And just over one in three respondents said the legal inquiry had not changed where they shopped.
The research also shows some Australians are already doing their supermarket shop across different stores, with 35 per cent splitting their grocery shopping between outlets to maximise their savings.

Consumer advocacy group Choice has welcomed the government's in-principle support for the ACCC's recommendations to regulate confusing promotions, shrinkflation, and price ambiguity.
""We need to fix the power imbalance between supermarkets and consumers and price transparency will help us do that,"" Choice CEO Ashley de Silva said.
Research conducted by Choice last year showed 1 in 4 people found it difficult to identify whether certain supermarket labels represented a true discount.
""Sometimes labels claim a discount, but don’t specify how much or note the previous shelf price, making the claim impossible for consumers to verify. Introducing minimum information requirements on price displays will help stop supermarkets obscuring endless price increases,” de Silva said.
To combat shrinkflation, an instance where a product’s size decreases but the price either remains the same or increases, the ACCC has recommended supermarkets be required to publish notifications when this occurs.
The supermarkets inquiry final report has made 20 recommendations in total.

The Business Council of Co-operatives and Mutuals (BCCM) has backed the ACCC's recommendation calling for federal measures to incentivise more community owned and co-operative supermarket stores in regional and remote areas.
""With cost of living issues likely to be front and centre during the election campaign this ACCC report will put the spotlight on Canberra's response and how it plans to make life just a bit easier for those who vote but don't live in metropolitan areas,"" BCCM CEO Melina Morrison said.
""Consumers outside the big cities will continue to suffer when it comes to their shopping bill on food  and groceries because of the clear oligopoly in the supermarket sector.""
In its report, the ACCC noted major supermarket operators are dominant in areas outside key cities, with limited choices for consumers.
""As  such, supporting existing – and new – community-owned stores in remote areas that would  otherwise be unserved or under-served may be an effective way to address some of the issues that  result from lack of competition in those areas,” the report said.

Chief executive of Aldi Australia Anna McGrath says the ACCC's inquiry into the supermarket sector confirms Aldi's role in offering products at ""everyday low prices"".
The consumer watchdog's report noted that Aldi, Coles and Woolworths appeared to have some of the highest profit margins among supermarkets worldwide.
It found that the latter two had ""limited incentive to compete vigorously with each other on price"", and that Aldi was providing a bit of extra competition.
Here's McGrath's response to the report:
""We've seen more customers turning to ALDI and we take pride in offering consistent value week in and week out, so our customers don't have to chase discounts or specials.
We keep prices low through extraordinary efficiency across our whole business. From our curated range of 1,800 quality products, simplified packaging, our line-up of exclusive brands and our Australian first sourcing policy, to how we stack the shelves and load our trucks — delivering value to our customers is built into our business model.""
She added that a new website due for release next month would include pricing for all of Aldi's core range and discounted items, seeking to make it easier for customers to compare products between retailers.

It's been a rocky day on the ASX 200.
The benchmark index is now up 0.2% to 7,939.
Here's a look at the biggest gains and declines:
Turns out the ACCC's report on supermarket power has been good for Woolworths. Its stocks are up 4.9%. Coles is up 3%.
Cash-strapped consumers and investors tend to view findings of market power and global profit comparisons very differently.
Sectors are mixed as we head towards 1pm, AEDT:
Consumer staples is the biggest winner today. Coles and Woolworths are a big reason why.

Metcash, which runs the IGA brand, has responded to the ACCC's inquiry.
Here is their response in full:
As discussed throughout the inquiry, an independent network is integral to healthy competition in the supermarket sector in Australia.
We are pleased that the ACCC has recognised this, particularly the competitive role independents play in many local communities where they are able to better tailor their range and offer to the preferences of locals.
While we still need to go through the detail of all the recommendations outlined in the report, we support the ACCC in its view that despite the progress independents have made on better prices, there are other significant barriers for independent retailers to compete with the major chains. We too are concerned with the growing dominance of the major supermarket chains in Australia and their ability to continue to grow through creeping acquisitions of independents and land banking.
We encourage the Government to take further action in these areas.

Solomon Lew's Premier Investments has posted its half-year results this morning.
Net profit was down 34% to $117.1 million, in the six months to January 2025, as consumers pulled back spending on discretionary spending.
The results predate Premier's sale of five fashion brands to department store Myer, which finalised on January 26. Those brands include Portmans, Dotti and Jacquie E.
During that half of the year, Premier had a 31% stake in Myer, however since the acquisition deal the company no longer holds any interest in the company.
Instead, the deal cemented Solomon Lew as Myer's biggest shareholder. Lew and his family, through Lew Group, own a 27.7% stake in the company.
Premier holds a 25% stake in kitchen appliance maker Breville.
Premier's retail division is now comprised of Smiggle and Peter Alexander.
Stationary brand Smiggle's sales were down 14.5% on the 1H24, with Premier attributing the fall to a ""challenging global discretionary retail environment, with the Smiggle customer particularly exposed to increased cost of living pressures in all global markets.""
Peter Alexander sales were up 6.6% to $297.7 million.
However, that excluded the results of the recently launched Peter Alexander UK.
Premier's Chairman Solomon Lew had this to say about the results:
“Premier currently continues to own the high margin, iconic brands of Peter Alexander and Smiggle. Both brands will fully focus on leveraging growth in existing markets and expanding their reach in new markets through further international expansion in the coming years. In addition, Premier continues to hold its substantial investment in Breville Group, strategic property ownership and significant cash reserves.
The outcomes and value created for Premier shareholders in 1H25 represents the culmination of years of focus and investment in our brands through providing quality and exciting products to our customers while creating and unlocking value for our shareholders.""
Premier's share price was up half a per cent to $21.52.

National Farmers' Federation president David Jochinke says ""there is a delicate balance"" when it comes to the importance of seeing real change in the supermarket for farmers.
""[It] is also ensuring that farmers are being able to be profitable and consumers have got access to affordable food with adequate supply chains.
""Obviously, supply chains cost money and for farmers to produce that affordable food at the high quality is also a cost price squeeze that farmers have felt throughout the last not only COVID period but prior to this in many sectors of the supermarket trolley, have not necessarily increased their prices or increased the price that farmers are receiving,"" Jochinke told Radio National Breakfast.
He added that ""agriculture still doesn't believe in many sectors, especially in the horticulture area, that we're getting a fair deal.""

Unless you take meticulous notes of everything you have ever bought at the shops, chances are you've also been impacted by 'shrinkflation'.
The phenomenon refers to a product being downsized when its price either remains the same or increases.
It was a key concern raised by the tens of thousands of consumers surveyed by the ACCC throughout its supermarkets inquiry.
To curb the practice, the regulator has recommended supermarkets be required to publish notifications when shrinkflation occurs.
If you want to learn more about what this involves, read the below piece by Tessa Flemming:

The ASX 200 has closed gained almost 0.2% to close 7,932.10.
It's been a very up-and-down kind of day, with supermarkets lifting the bourse higher.
Coles and Woolworths had some of the biggest gains on Friday, with investors seemingly happy about the ACCC's take on the duopoly's market dominance.
Sector-wise, it was Coles and Woolworths that saw consumer staples finish on top.
Wholesale distribution company Metcash rose 3.6% to $3.19.
Endeavour Group and Graincorp followed suit to gain 2% and 0.4%, respectively

Steve Ronalds, a co-founder of Victorian milk company Gibson Jersey, criticised major supermarkets for selling milk at a loss to attract customers.
He says retailers offer up discounted products as ""bait to drive in consumers"" by pressuring small suppliers like his to maintain high margins on milk, which then subsidises the cheap milk on supermarket shelves.
""We have to be profitable, and we just can't drop the price. They do ask us to drop the price, or ask how we can supply it cheaper, and we just say we can't,"" he told ABC News.
""Unfortunately consumers are going to have to pay a little bit more if they want to have an Australian industry. Imports are increasing as our local manufacturing is falling off.""
Gibson Jersey says products were removed from 65 Coles stores in Victoria mid-last year for refusing to give the supermarket a bigger profit margin.
Despite being removed from those stores, Ronalds said his sales had increased in independent supermarkets, indicating consumer support for local agriculture
He called for fair milk prices, collective action among suppliers and greater transparency in the industry.

It's been 12 months in the making, but an inquiry into Australia's supermarkets by the competition watchdog has been unable to conclude whether price gouging is taking place.
The federal government directed the ACCC to investigate the country's supermarkets in January last year, following frequent allegations of price gouging during the pandemic and cost-of-living crisis that followed.
But the long-awaited report — the first of its kind in 16 years — declared Australia is home to one of the most profitable supermarket sectors in the world, and Woolworths and Coles don't have a strict duopoly.
Here are the key takeaways from the full 441-page report, and what it means for shoppers at the check-out.
By Heloise Vyas
Data from the Australia Bureau of Statistics (ABS) shows 52,800 jobs were lost from the economy in February.
The fall in employment has been attributed to fewer older workers returning to work in February, with employment among older age groups lower than in the same month in 2024.
It raises the bets for an interest rate cut in May, with three of the Big Four banks forecasting one, but that will depend on the next round of quarterly inflation figures due to be released in April.

Check out who is leading the gains:
Seven of 11 sectors are higher, with the big supermarkets boosting the consumer staples sector.
The ""relief rally"" continues.

Coles and Woolies are both up significantly. Was the ACCC report really that good for them?
- Andy Smith
A good question above from reader Andy.
Further from my previous post featuring comments on this from analyst George Boubouras, here is another take on why Coles and Woolworths stocks are rallying today.
Craig Woodford, senior research analyst at MST Marquee, had this to say:
""There have been concerns amongst investors there would be significant consequences for the supermarkets.
While there will be ongoing scrutiny, the ACCC report has concluded that the supermarkets are not responsible for price gouging. The share price response is definitely best described as a 'relief rally'.""
In short, investors reckon the supermarkets have come out the ACCC investigation relatively unscathed.
Currently Coles share price is up 4.5%, to $19.40.
Woolworths has gained 5.5% to $29.72.
By Rhiana Whitson
Supermarket analyst George Boubouras, managing director of research and investments at K2 Asset Management, has sent through some thoughts on the ACCC's supermarkets report.
He says the ACCC report reinforces that Woolworths and Coles are some of the most profitable supermarkets globally:
""Their margins have fallen however remains high vs global peers which is a key attribute of oligopoly pricing power. Interestingly, the report concluded there is limited evidence of pricing power within the sector. This is clearly very supportive for their share price as some regulatory uncertainty has now been removed.
Despite the increased competition over the past decade, the market share of the major supermarkets still remains one of the highest globally.
Given this persistent market dominance of both COL and WOW, it is difficult to reconcile that this does not lead to “structural” dominance in the sector, from supply chain through to pricing.
The ACCC report is a welcomed report that at the very least keeps the basic concepts of the highly concentrated Australian supermarket sector front and centre for ongoing debate.""
But he says, in the short term, the ACCC report is ""a great result for both COL and WOW given the circumstances. ""
That's because despite the millions spent on investigating supermarket power, as Boubouras points out the ACCC has not produced any concrete or structural findings of wrongdoing. Something Boubouras finds hard to reconcile.
Market dominance, yes. But not much more than that.
Boubouras says the findings on supermarket prices are good news for investors.
Basically, investors are happy about the market dominance, profits and what that means for them as shareholders.

""For decades, America's pharmaceutical giants have been plotting to torpedo Australia's Pharmaceuticals Benefits Scheme (PBS),"" writes our chief business correspondent Ian Verrender.
Twenty years ago, they scored a huge victory when they secured major concessions from the Howard government, as America and Australia negotiated the Australia-US Free Trade Agreement.
Big pharma was at it again during the Obama years when Australia was on the cusp of signing up to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP).
A multilateral trade deal, the TPP was designed to build a regional bloc against China.
Buried in the detail, however, were clauses that quietly entrenched the power of major American corporations.

A survey conducted by Canstar Blue shows 43 per cent of Australians have altered their shopping habits between now and when the ACCC's inquiry into the supermarket sector was announced last January.
Of the 3,000 people asked about their attitudes towards Coles and Woolworths since the probe commenced, 23 per cent said they were more cautious when shopping with both retailers and 17 per cent admitted they were choosing to shop with them less frequently.
And just over one in three respondents said the legal inquiry had not changed where they shopped.
The research also shows some Australians are already doing their supermarket shop across different stores, with 35 per cent splitting their grocery shopping between outlets to maximise their savings.

Consumer advocacy group Choice has welcomed the government's in-principle support for the ACCC's recommendations to regulate confusing promotions, shrinkflation, and price ambiguity.
""We need to fix the power imbalance between supermarkets and consumers and price transparency will help us do that,"" Choice CEO Ashley de Silva said.
Research conducted by Choice last year showed 1 in 4 people found it difficult to identify whether certain supermarket labels represented a true discount.
""Sometimes labels claim a discount, but don’t specify how much or note the previous shelf price, making the claim impossible for consumers to verify. Introducing minimum information requirements on price displays will help stop supermarkets obscuring endless price increases,” de Silva said.
To combat shrinkflation, an instance where a product’s size decreases but the price either remains the same or increases, the ACCC has recommended supermarkets be required to publish notifications when this occurs.
The supermarkets inquiry final report has made 20 recommendations in total.
By Heloise Vyas
The Business Council of Co-operatives and Mutuals (BCCM) has backed the ACCC's recommendation calling for federal measures to incentivise more community owned and co-operative supermarket stores in regional and remote areas.
""With cost of living issues likely to be front and centre during the election campaign this ACCC report will put the spotlight on Canberra's response and how it plans to make life just a bit easier for those who vote but don't live in metropolitan areas,"" BCCM CEO Melina Morrison said.
""Consumers outside the big cities will continue to suffer when it comes to their shopping bill on food  and groceries because of the clear oligopoly in the supermarket sector.""
In its report, the ACCC noted major supermarket operators are dominant in areas outside key cities, with limited choices for consumers.
""As  such, supporting existing – and new – community-owned stores in remote areas that would  otherwise be unserved or under-served may be an effective way to address some of the issues that  result from lack of competition in those areas,” the report said.

Chief executive of Aldi Australia Anna McGrath says the ACCC's inquiry into the supermarket sector confirms Aldi's role in offering products at ""everyday low prices"".
The consumer watchdog's report noted that Aldi, Coles and Woolworths appeared to have some of the highest profit margins among supermarkets worldwide.
It found that the latter two had ""limited incentive to compete vigorously with each other on price"", and that Aldi was providing a bit of extra competition.
Here's McGrath's response to the report:
""We've seen more customers turning to ALDI and we take pride in offering consistent value week in and week out, so our customers don't have to chase discounts or specials.
We keep prices low through extraordinary efficiency across our whole business. From our curated range of 1,800 quality products, simplified packaging, our line-up of exclusive brands and our Australian first sourcing policy, to how we stack the shelves and load our trucks — delivering value to our customers is built into our business model.""
She added that a new website due for release next month would include pricing for all of Aldi's core range and discounted items, seeking to make it easier for customers to compare products between retailers.

It's been a rocky day on the ASX 200.
The benchmark index is now up 0.2% to 7,939.
Here's a look at the biggest gains and declines:
Turns out the ACCC's report on supermarket power has been good for Woolworths. Its stocks are up 4.9%. Coles is up 3%.
Cash-strapped consumers and investors tend to view findings of market power and global profit comparisons very differently.
Sectors are mixed as we head towards 1pm, AEDT:
Consumer staples is the biggest winner today. Coles and Woolworths are a big reason why.
By Caitlin Rawling
Metcash, which runs the IGA brand, has responded to the ACCC's inquiry.
Here is their response in full:
As discussed throughout the inquiry, an independent network is integral to healthy competition in the supermarket sector in Australia.
We are pleased that the ACCC has recognised this, particularly the competitive role independents play in many local communities where they are able to better tailor their range and offer to the preferences of locals.
While we still need to go through the detail of all the recommendations outlined in the report, we support the ACCC in its view that despite the progress independents have made on better prices, there are other significant barriers for independent retailers to compete with the major chains. We too are concerned with the growing dominance of the major supermarket chains in Australia and their ability to continue to grow through creeping acquisitions of independents and land banking.
We encourage the Government to take further action in these areas.

Solomon Lew's Premier Investments has posted its half-year results this morning.
Net profit was down 34% to $117.1 million, in the six months to January 2025, as consumers pulled back spending on discretionary spending.
The results predate Premier's sale of five fashion brands to department store Myer, which finalised on January 26. Those brands include Portmans, Dotti and Jacquie E.
During that half of the year, Premier had a 31% stake in Myer, however since the acquisition deal the company no longer holds any interest in the company.
Instead, the deal cemented Solomon Lew as Myer's biggest shareholder. Lew and his family, through Lew Group, own a 27.7% stake in the company.
Premier holds a 25% stake in kitchen appliance maker Breville.
Premier's retail division is now comprised of Smiggle and Peter Alexander.
Stationary brand Smiggle's sales were down 14.5% on the 1H24, with Premier attributing the fall to a ""challenging global discretionary retail environment, with the Smiggle customer particularly exposed to increased cost of living pressures in all global markets.""
Peter Alexander sales were up 6.6% to $297.7 million.
However, that excluded the results of the recently launched Peter Alexander UK.
Premier's Chairman Solomon Lew had this to say about the results:
“Premier currently continues to own the high margin, iconic brands of Peter Alexander and Smiggle. Both brands will fully focus on leveraging growth in existing markets and expanding their reach in new markets through further international expansion in the coming years.

""We've seen more customers turning to ALDI and we take pride in offering consistent value week in and week out, so our customers don't have to chase discounts or specials.
We keep prices low through extraordinary efficiency across our whole business. From our curated range of 1,800 quality products, simplified packaging, our line-up of exclusive brands and our Australian first sourcing policy, to how we stack the shelves and load our trucks — delivering value to our customers is built into our business model.""
She added that a new website due for release next month would include pricing for all of Aldi's core range and discounted items, seeking to make it easier for customers to compare products between retailers.

It's been a rocky day on the ASX 200.
The benchmark index is now up 0.2% to 7,939.
Here's a look at the biggest gains and declines:
Turns out the ACCC's report on supermarket power has been good for Woolworths. Its stocks are up 4.9%. Coles is up 3%.
Cash-strapped consumers and investors tend to view findings of market power and global profit comparisons very differently.
Sectors are mixed as we head towards 1pm, AEDT:
Consumer staples is the biggest winner today. Coles and Woolworths are a big reason why.

Metcash, which runs the IGA brand, has responded to the ACCC's inquiry.
Here is their response in full:
As discussed throughout the inquiry, an independent network is integral to healthy competition in the supermarket sector in Australia.
We are pleased that the ACCC has recognised this, particularly the competitive role independents play in many local communities where they are able to better tailor their range and offer to the preferences of locals.
While we still need to go through the detail of all the recommendations outlined in the report, we support the ACCC in its view that despite the progress independents have made on better prices, there are other significant barriers for independent retailers to compete with the major chains. We too are concerned with the growing dominance of the major supermarket chains in Australia and their ability to continue to grow through creeping acquisitions of independents and land banking.
We encourage the Government to take further action in these areas.

Solomon Lew's Premier Investments has posted its half-year results this morning.
Net profit was down 34% to $117.1 million, in the six months to January 2025, as consumers pulled back spending on discretionary spending.
The results predate Premier's sale of five fashion brands to department store Myer, which finalised on January 26. Those brands include Portmans, Dotti and Jacquie E.
During that half of the year, Premier had a 31% stake in Myer, however since the acquisition deal the company no longer holds any interest in the company.
Instead, the deal cemented Solomon Lew as Myer's biggest shareholder. Lew and his family, through Lew Group, own a 27.7% stake in the company.
Premier holds a 25% stake in kitchen appliance maker Breville.
Premier's retail division is now comprised of Smiggle and Peter Alexander.
Stationary brand Smiggle's sales were down 14.5% on the 1H24, with Premier attributing the fall to a ""challenging global discretionary retail environment, with the Smiggle customer particularly exposed to increased cost of living pressures in all global markets.""
Peter Alexander sales were up 6.6% to $297.7 million.
However, that excluded the results of the recently launched Peter Alexander UK.
Premier's Chairman Solomon Lew had this to say about the results:
“Premier currently continues to own the high margin, iconic brands of Peter Alexander and Smiggle. Both brands will fully focus on leveraging growth in existing markets and expanding their reach in new markets through further international expansion in the coming years. In addition, Premier continues to hold its substantial investment in Breville Group, strategic property ownership and significant cash reserves.
The outcomes and value created for Premier shareholders in 1H25 represents the culmination of years of focus and investment in our brands through providing quality and exciting products to our customers while creating and unlocking value for our shareholders.""
Premier's share price was up half a per cent to $21.52.
(EDIT NOTE: This post has been updated to reflect that Premier has not held an interest in Myer since the acquisition deal.)

National Farmers' Federation president David Jochinke says ""there is a delicate balance"" when it comes to the importance of seeing real change in the supermarket for farmers.
""[It] is also ensuring that farmers are being able to be profitable and consumers have got access to affordable food with adequate supply chains.
""Obviously, supply chains cost money and for farmers to produce that affordable food at the high quality is also a cost price squeeze that farmers have felt throughout the last not only COVID period but prior to this in many sectors of the supermarket trolley, have not necessarily increased their prices or increased the price that farmers are receiving,"" Jochinke told Radio National Breakfast.
He added that ""agriculture still doesn't believe in many sectors, especially in the horticulture area, that we're getting a fair deal.""

"Unemployment rate steady at 4.1pc in February as employment falls by 53,000",Stephanie Chalmers,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-20/unemployment-rate-steady-in-february-abs/105074546,"Australia's unemployment rate remained steady at 4.1 per cent in February, as labour force participation declined.
According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), 52,800 jobs were lost from the economy, well below forecasts of a 30,000 increase in employment.
The drop in employment came as fewer people were in work or looking for a job, with the participation rate falling to 66.8 per cent, from a record high of 67.3 per cent in January.
The ABS attributed part of the fall in employment to fewer older workers returning to work in February, with employment among older age groups lower than in the same month in 2024.
""This follows higher levels of employment in these age groups in recent years, particularly in 2024, alongside growth in the employment-to-population ratio over the last few years,"" ABS head of labour statistics Bjorn Jarvis said.
In January, the unemployment rate edged higher to 4.1 per cent, but the rate of workforce participation hit a new high and the number of jobs added significantly beat forecasts.
""The participation rate is still relatively high, having reached a historical high last month, and is 0.1 percentage points higher than this time last year,"" Mr Jarvis said.
The Reserve Bank's latest forecasts, released last month, are for the unemployment rate to average 4.2 per cent by mid-year, and remain around that level over the next few years.
January's jobs data was impacted by Australians waiting to return to work or start new roles after the summer break and economists have observed seasonal effects still playing out in February.
""We wouldn't be surprised if the sharp fall in employment last month is revised to a smaller one over the coming months,"" Capital Economics head of Asia-Pacific Marcel Thieliant wrote.
Betashares chief economist David Bassanese said the ""apparent steep fall in employment during February needs to be taken with a grain of salt"", pointing to ""turn-of-the-year seasonal adjustment problems"" since the pandemic.
The ABS said there were higher levels of retirement in Australia in recent month, and that it would release more detailed data on the trend next week.
The Australian dollar posted a modest decline following the release of the figures.
The RBA board will deliver its next interest rate decision on April 1 and the tight labour market has been on their radar, but economists do not expect this latest data to have a significant impact on their decision.
The Reserve Bank's chief economist says current economic uncertainty, especially around US tariffs, makes forecasting and rate setting more difficult.
Mr Thieliant said it provided ""no reason for the RBA to panic"", given the unemployment rate remained steady despite the shock decline in employment.
""Given that economic activity is now rebounding, we doubt that the labour market will loosen much further,"" he said.
""Accordingly, we still think that the [RBA] will only deliver a very shallow loosening cycle and have pencilled in just two more 25bp rate cuts.""
Callam Pickering, an economist at jobs site Indeed, noted it was the biggest fall in employment since December 2023 but described the jobs market as remaining ""healthy"".
""That earlier decline didn't derail Australia’s jobs boom and I suspect that'll be true of the February decline as well,"" he said.
""The Reserve Bank is unlikely to be too concerned… Certainly a decline in employment is undesirable, but the labour market remains incredibly tight.
""Another weaker outcome in March, however, would certainly give them a lot to think about.""
Mr Pickering forecast another interest rate cut in May or July.
A report finds one charity helping women into the workforce has generated $86 million in net direct economic benefits over the past 20 years.
ANZ Research had earlier forecast an August cut and maintained that call after Thursday's release.

Star Entertainment Group close to selling stake in Brisbane-based Queen's Wharf precinct in last-minute life saving effort,James Harrison,https://www.skynews.com.au/business/finance/star-entertainment-group-close-to-selling-stake-in-brisbanebased-queens-wharf-precinct-in-lastminute-life-saving-effort/news-story/aa22e8744fd2f335996e6f16d4f3fc39,"Star Entertainment Group is close to selling its stake in the Queen’s Wharf precinct to Hong Kong-based investors in a deal that could secure $50 million for the company as it attempts to stave off collapse.
The embattled casino operator has desperately sought more cash as it was forced into a trading halt earlier this week after failing to publish its half-year financial results by the Friday deadline.
Media reports arose on Thursday that Star is close to securing a deal where it will sell off its stake in the Brisbane property to Far East Consortium and Chow Tai Fook – which each own 25 per cent stakes in the precinct.
This comes about a month after the casino operator confirmed it had knocked back several offers from the Hong Kong investors as they could not come to an agreement on key details.
The new deal could prevent Star from going into administration by this weekend, according to The Australian.
Star’s chief executive Steve McCann is also looking at securing the $60m from the sale of its events centre at its Sydney premises, which remains in escrow.
The casino operator in January revealed the sale of the complex – which it had previously described as a $100m venue – to Foundation Theatres.
Its attempts to secure more cash comes at it owes about $430m to an array of lenders.
Sky News' Business Reporter Ed Boyd said Star was paying an interest rate to banks of ""around 16 per cent"".
He also noted the company's future in administration could cost around $300m but stressed there is an option for the company to secure more cash.
""Pub baron Bruce Mathieson's company, they've place a $550m bid just for the Gold Coast Jupiter's Casino - that's been knocked back but that bid is still on the table,"" Boyd said.
Star had just $78m left as of December 31 after churning through $107m over the previous three months.
It recently said it was considering a $650m financial lifeline from American asset management firm Oaktree Capital Management which could help it stay afloat.
However, this deal could be in doubt, according to Sky News’ Ross Greenwood, as Oaktree wants the ""rights over the property"" where the Star Casino in Sydney sits, which is owned by the NSW Government.
“My understanding of it is that there is no way known that the New South Wales Government will give that up easily,"" Greenwood said.
“In fact, the NSW Government, in my understanding, would allow the Star to go into insolvency and then deal with the administrators.”
Prior to Greenwood’s revelation, Star briefly put itself into a trading halt only to resume trading a short time later without alerting shareholders.
Star also noted it could post its results if it received an appropriate liquidity proposal, with the group anticipating “one or more” on Friday.
However, the company has been unable to secure a new finance deal.
The Australian Securities Exchange on Monday alerted shareholders that Star, alongside seven other publicly listed companies, was suspended from trading for failing to publish their results.

AMP comes under fire from Finance Sector Union for 'draconian' contract allowing surveillance of employees at home,James Harrison,https://www.skynews.com.au/business/finance/amp-comes-under-fire-from-finance-sector-union-for-draconian-contract-allowing-surveillance-of-employees-at-home/news-story/7e536d0c800816b3bbff2f84a297f784,"Staff at a major superannuation fund have been given one week to sign a contract which allows surveillance of its employees working from home, selling their personal information and making them undergo a medical exam.
The contract from AMP, which has been panned as “draconian” by the Finance Sector Union, also forbids workers from seeking advice about this contract from a lawyer or accountant without the company’s permission, The Australian has revealed.
It also requires former employees to assist the super fund with legal proceedings for upwards of seven years.
About 2000 staff members were handed the contracts on Monday and given until March 24 to sign and return them.
The contracts would force employees to give up rights such as penalties, overtime and annual leave in exchange for a “flat rate” of pay, according to FSU.
It also said staffers were being incentivised to sign these contracts with a $1000 share plan grant and failure to sign will mean they are not eligible for employee incentive programs.
“This is a draconian contract that features some very disturbing surveillance and medical privacy provisions,” FSU’s national assistant secretary Nicole McPherson said in a statement.
“It is shocking that any employer would propose the right to video monitor its workers in their own homes, force them to undergo a medical examination by the employer’s doctor of choice and give up their right to privacy of medical information.”
The contract says AMP  “may carry out continuous, ongoing camera surveillance on or around the premises of AMP and in any other place where you work”, with one day’s notice.
Ms McPherson said the fund could possibly monitor employees via built in cameras on people’s computers when they are working at home.
“Is this legal? Well, that really depends on the state, but we have some serious concerns,” she told Sky News on Friday.
The union is advising AMP workers not to sign this contract and has proposed a litany of changes.
“We're waiting to hear back, but workers only have until Monday to sign this contract so AMP is absolutely on the clock,” Ms McPherson said.
“It's really up to them now to see whether they're going to do the right thing or not.”
AMP is also trying to undermine the right to disconnect through a clause in some contracts that requires workers to reply to contact from the super fund and third parties outside work hours, the union said.
The contract also allows AMP to change work location at any time and enforces limitations on damages for breaches of the contract that involve personal illness.
Ms McPherson called on AMP to come to the negotiating table as the contract fails to include critical details usually found in these agreements.
“Because AMP refuses to bargain for a new Enterprise Agreement, important rights are in policy, meaning AMP can remove or change things at any time,” she said.
“For example, the new contract does not contain details of any guaranteed pay increase, leave or redundancy entitlements.
“AMP needs to come to the table and urgently negotiate an Enterprise Agreement which would give its workers rights and protection.”
An AMP spokesperson defended the surveillance of the workers and insisted they would not be video monitored at home.
""(The surveillance clauses) are common in most contemporary employment contracts, including the right to monitor employee computer usage on employer-provided devices when they are ­working from home,” the spokesperson told The Australian.

The patient with the confirmed case also made their way to the city's east and visited 169 Cafe in Randwick and Ooshman Maroubra on March 10, then Matraville Medical Complex and Princes of Wales Hospital Emergency Department from March 13 to March 15.
South Eastern Sydney Local Health District Director of Public Health, Dr Vicky Sheppeard, said people who visited the above locations should monitor their health until April 2, as it can take up to 18 days for symptoms to appear after an exposure.
Measles is spread through the air when someone who is infectious coughs or sneezes.
“Symptoms to watch out for include fever, runny nose, sore eyes and a cough, usually followed three or four days later by a red, blotchy rash that spreads from the head to the rest of the body,"" Dr Sheppeard said.
“If they develop symptoms, they should call ahead to their GP or emergency department to ensure they do not spend time in the waiting room with other patients.
“We want to remind the community to make sure they are up to date with their vaccinations. The measles vaccine can prevent the disease even after exposure, if given early enough.

Laos promises to fully investigate the source of methanol poisoning as Bianca Jones’ father makes urgent public plea,Laurence Karacsony,https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/trending/laos-promises-to-fully-investigate-the-source-of-methanol-poisoning-as-bianca-jones-father-makes-urgent-public-plea/news-story/0d6da9d9074edd3ac3835dcd24224be0,"The father of one of the Australian teenagers who tragically died in Laos from a suspected methanol poisoning has called on the government of the South Asian country to make sure there was no repeat.
Bianca Jones and her best friend Holly Bowles died in hospital after falling victim to a mass methanol poisoning after having consumed drinks laced with the toxic chemical on Tuesday.
Father Mark Jones broke his silence after his daughter’s death, telling Nine News on Saturday his 19-year-old girl was on a “trip of a lifetime with one of her best mates” before her life had “cruelly been cut short”.
Mr Jones took the opportunity to urge the Laos government to “investigate this to the fullest extent” to ensure it “doesn’t happen again”.
“We can’t have the passing of our daughter … not lead to change to protect others,” he said.
His plea came amid a secretive investigation by authorities in Laos who have since vowed to “bring the perpetrators to justice” after the deaths of six foreign nationals while holidaying in Vang Vieng.
In a statement, the Laotian government said it was “profoundly saddened” by the loss of life and expressed its condolences to the families of the deceased foreign tourists.
Mr Jones said young men and women should be safe while they travel and create their own life experiences.
“We’ll forever miss our beautiful girl and hope her loss of life has not been in vain,” he said.
According to the Vientiane Times, the Australian girls are believed to have consumed drinks suspected of containing methanol, a toxic substance which is “often found in bootleg alcohol”, and is a cheaper alternative to ethanol.
Jones and Bowles stayed at Nana Backpacker Hostel and the operators of the establishment have been detained for questioning.
The two girls alerted staff at the hostel to their deteriorating health and were rushed to separate hospitals in the neighbouring country of Thailand and put on life support.
According to the hostel manager, the Melbourne teenagers reportedly only drank three local whisky Coke Zeros over two hours on the night of the fatal poisoning.
Local law enforcement told the Associated Press that a “number of people” had been detained,  but that no charges had been laid.

We asked our readers how they lowered their insurance premiums. Here are their tips,By Widia Jalal,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-02-27/audience-responses-insurance-premiums-tips-and-tricks/104983110,"As weather events and climate change put upward pressure on home insurance premiums, annual increases have become a major impost on household budgets.
We asked our readers to share their success stories in lowering their premiums, and had experts weigh in with their advice on the best strategies.
Here's what our brains trust had to say.
Home owners can decide whether to insure solely their property or extend their cover to include the loss of household items and belongings in the event of a mishap.
Taking out home insurance covers only damage to the property, whereas combined home and contents insurance factors in the value of material things inside the home that are damaged or lost, alongside the cost to rebuild.
If you're considering taking out insurance for your belongings for the first time, or you're reviewing existing cover, here are some important things to keep in mind.
CHOICE insurance expert Jodi Bird says it's important to distinguish the rebuilding costs from the actual market value of your home.
He suggests using an independent online calculator to help estimate costs and then comparing those to what's available on insurance provider websites.
That is why some readers actively stay across current costs that are involved with rebuilding when reviewing their policy covers.
Another way to lower your cost is each year or every two years at least check out how much coverage you really need for your contents cover. If you've got coverage of $100,000 for contents and you lose it and your contents are only worth $50,000, you will only be paid the replacement value of $50,000. Many people also forget insurance companies do not insure the land. They're only insuring the building on the land and you need to consider the building materials. — Jon, Vic
With the house & contents policy most insurers automatically put it up each year based on increased building costs, clean-up costs & other fees etc. But you can do your own checking to get an estimate rebuild figure. Sometimes what they say is the cost is higher than needed. I got them to leave it at the previous year's premium & I'll consider it again if needed at the next renewal. — Ian, Qld
Some readers were able to lower their premium payments after deciding they could do without certain coverage, something Mr Bird emphasises should be done with caution.
I have received a quote of about $700 lower than my current insurer on house and contents. New insurance does not cover flood. My council's flood certificate states no risk of flooding so worth the risk. — Suzanne, Qld
Shopped around to lower my apartment contents insurance and found a cheaper company. I rang to cancel my insurance with my existing provider, and they did a check. They asked if I needed flood insurance, I said no, and the price dropped dramatically. — David, NSW
In these instances, Mr Bird says it's important to be fully informed about the flood risk in your area.
One way to check this is to toggle on the flood premium option on your insurance provider's website.
If it reduces your payment, Mr Bird says, ""That's the insurer's way of saying they think there is a risk of flood where you are and that's something worth checking out with the local council.""
Sometimes, all it takes is a conversation with your insurance provider.

At least, that was the case for these readers.
I managed to lower the premium just by negotiating. This has happened twice and I'm wondering whether there's not a set amount that the customer service people are permitted to offer. — Adam, Vic
Our premium went up by a few thousand. I called the insurer, and after a short, pleasant conversation the premium was dropped to slightly above the previous year. — Peter, NSW
Even if that means being transparent about your financial means.
I have rung the insurance provider, told them it's too expensive and asked them to make a better offer. This usually results in a reduction of $150-$250. — Rebecca, Tas
Henri from Queensland took a more proactive approach and provided his insurer with quotes from competitors that resulted in a price match.
We received our renewal invoice and it was $7,500. After comparing with two other insurance companies (with the same levels of cover and similar excess) and getting a far better quote (some $2,250 cheaper), I rang our insurance company and complained to them about the price. My call was escalated to a more senior person and they offered to match the lowest competitive price. We agreed and ended up saving approximately $2,250 — a great result. However, I'm unsure if it will happen this December when our insurance comes up for renewal again.
It's also worth checking against your existing provider in doing a price match, says Mr Bird.
""Pretend to be a new customer and see if you actually get a cheaper deal that way,"" he says.
If they offer a lower price, don't be afraid to contact your insurer and request them to match the better offer.

Heard of the loyalty tax?
The motto ""persistence pays"" has come true for Henri van Riet who shaved off more than $2,500 by refusing to take no for an answer.
It's when insurers attract as many new customers as possible by offering hefty discounts up-front, which are later replaced with inflated premiums.
Being loyal to an insurer doesn't come with rewards, Financial Counselling Australia chief executive Peter Gartlan says.
He urges people to move around or negotiate for better deals.
ACT resident Belinda shared her experience with switching providers after decades of being a loyal customer.
The decision came with pleasant surprises.
I had been a loyal and constant customer with the same insurer for almost 20 years. In 2024, I had finally had enough of the insurance premiums going up and up while the insured value dropped. So, I contacted the company to have them reduce the premium by a small percentage. I then shopped around and got various quotes from other companies — I was shocked to see the premiums for identical options hundreds of dollars lower with multiple companies — up to $500 lower in the case of our house insurance. I have now moved each policy across to the new insurer as they were renewed. The new company also offered no fee pay by the month while the previous company charged you more to pay by the month.
And while switching providers may seem daunting at first, comparison websites can make the process easier.
Ian from NSW traded an hour of his time spent on research for $500 worth of savings.
I reduced my house insurance from $ 1536.05 to $1028.10 simply by comparing most insurance companies. For spending an hour on the internet I saved $500 or a third of what I was being charged.
But if sifting through comparison websites prove unfruitful, it might be worth keeping your eyes and ears peeled for signs around you.
A colleague's recommendation saved Sam from Western Australia $5,000 on her insurance premium, which had initially doubled.
I bought a house last year. To insure it, I used the provider of my contents insurance. I found them through a insurance broker. This year, my insurance had doubled to around $9,000 for the year. Comparison sites weren't able to provide a cheaper alternative, neither was the insurance broker. I accepted that's the best I could do. Thankfully [I talked] to a colleague [and] they recommended their insurer. I got a quote for $4k and switched. Very thankful I had the conversation.
William from New South Wales had an offer fall right into his hands at about 50 per cent less than what he was already paying.
Found a link to [an] insurance in one of their handouts, checked it and it was about 50% less than the current cost. The increase from 2024 to the current renewal with the now dumped insurance company was about $2000. Also able to pay monthly.
A CHOICE report out today compared quotes across 35 insurers, finding the average home insurance premium has increased by 16 per cent over the past year.
However, it stressed insurance premiums fluctuate across different areas over the years.
Mr Bird says this shows insurers were always adjusting their perceived risk levels. He suggests double-checking with insurers when a renewal comes around even if their prices were high in the past.
Here are the insurers whose average prices have increased by the most between January 2024 and January 2025, according to CHOICE.
Here are the insurers whose average price increase have increased by the smallest amount between January 2024 and January 2025, according to CHOICE.
On average, Mr Bird says, ""For every $500 you increase your excess by, you reduce your actual premium by about 10 per cent"".
Jodi Bird urges people to compare prices not just among providers but also within the chosen insurer, on each premium renewal. (Supplied: Jodi Bird)
While increasing your excess can lower the premium amount, there are important factors to consider.
An excess is the fixed amount you would need to pay the insurer for when making a claim on your insurance policy.
Choosing a higher excess amount results in a lower premium rate.
So, it involves making a judgement between paying more up-front or having the excess amount ready down the road when an unexpected event happens.
This is what Simon from NSW had thoroughly considered in assessing what he was comfortable with losing, when making the decision to increase his excess amount.
He then scored $900 worth of savings on his insurance premium.
Dropping insurance quote… I simply increased my excess to the maximum ($5000) as I figured if my house burns down then $5,000 is well worth it to rebuild a house, and the likelihood of flood for me is minimal. Also, contents wise I don't own anything expensive really. Second-hand furniture is fine for me. My premium dropped from a quoted $2,500 to about $1,600. I'm not worried about slight damage, only the cost of a rebuild ie bushfire.
Others also shared similar experiences when they increased their excess.
[I] have in the past year doubled the size of their excess from $5,000 to $10,000. Taking up this feature saved me $400. — William from NSW
I negotiated a higher excess ($3,000 vs $1,000) to significantly reduce my premium. — Tom from Vic
If you struggle to manage or dispute costs on your own, you can engage either an insurance broker or approach an ombudsman via the Australian Financial Complaints Authority (AFCA) for some help in several areas, Mr Bird says.
An insurance broker provides advice tailored to your situation and can find out the best insurance options for you based on a thorough assessment of your needs.
Also acting as an advocate, they would also be able to undertake negotiations on your behalf.
Mr Bird says brokers can be very helpful in ""special circumstances"" such as if you are running a business from home or have a property larger than two hectares.
AFCA encourages you to take complaints to your insurer first and participate in their internal dispute processes before going to them for help.
It is important to note that AFCA will not consider complaints about premium increases unless it involves the following scenarios:
""Essentially, the insurer needs to be able to provide a valid reason for why they are increasing your premium by a certain amount,"" explains Mr Bird.
Here's how some readers have benefited from having third-party help.
I was shocked by the massive increase in my House and Contents insurance. I contacted my local Federal member of Parliament. He wrote to the CEO of this particular insurance company asking for a ""please explain!"" After the usual hoo-ha from the company, I did manage to get a 5 per cent discount off the premium … better than nothing I guess! — Bruce, NSW
My premium was up for renewal and I went online and completed an application. The premium jumped from $5,000 to $14,000 per year. I rang and said I had spoken to the Ombudsman and it was reduced to $6,000. — Lisa, QLD

Ian from NSW traded an hour of his time spent on research for $500 worth of savings.
I reduced my house insurance from $ 1536.05 to $1028.10 simply by comparing most insurance companies. For spending an hour on the internet I saved $500 or a third of what I was being charged.
But if sifting through comparison websites prove unfruitful, it might be worth keeping your eyes and ears peeled for signs around you.
A colleague's recommendation saved Sam from Western Australia $5,000 on her insurance premium, which had initially doubled.
I bought a house last year. To insure it, I used the provider of my contents insurance. I found them through a insurance broker. This year, my insurance had doubled to around $9,000 for the year. Comparison sites weren't able to provide a cheaper alternative, neither was the insurance broker. I accepted that's the best I could do. Thankfully [I talked] to a colleague [and] they recommended their insurer. I got a quote for $4k and switched. Very thankful I had the conversation.
William from New South Wales had an offer fall right into his hands at about 50 per cent less than what he was already paying.
Found a link to [an] insurance in one of their handouts, checked it and it was about 50% less than the current cost. The increase from 2024 to the current renewal with the now dumped insurance company was about $2000. Also able to pay monthly.
A CHOICE report out today compared quotes across 35 insurers, finding the average home insurance premium has increased by 16 per cent over the past year.
However, it stressed insurance premiums fluctuate across different areas over the years.
Mr Bird says this shows insurers were always adjusting their perceived risk levels. He suggests double-checking with insurers when a renewal comes around even if their prices were high in the past.
Here are the insurers whose average prices have increased by the most between January 2024 and January 2025, according to CHOICE.
Here are the insurers whose average price increase have increased by the smallest amount between January 2024 and January 2025, according to CHOICE.
On average, Mr Bird says, ""For every $500 you increase your excess by, you reduce your actual premium by about 10 per cent"".

While increasing your excess can lower the premium amount, there are important factors to consider.
An excess is the fixed amount you would need to pay the insurer for when making a claim on your insurance policy.
Choosing a higher excess amount results in a lower premium rate.
So, it involves making a judgement between paying more up-front or having the excess amount ready down the road when an unexpected event happens.
This is what Simon from NSW had thoroughly considered in assessing what he was comfortable with losing, when making the decision to increase his excess amount.
He then scored $900 worth of savings on his insurance premium.
Dropping insurance quote… I simply increased my excess to the maximum ($5000) as I figured if my house burns down then $5,000 is well worth it to rebuild a house, and the likelihood of flood for me is minimal. Also, contents wise I don't own anything expensive really. Second-hand furniture is fine for me. My premium dropped from a quoted $2,500 to about $1,600. I'm not worried about slight damage, only the cost of a rebuild ie bushfire.
Others also shared similar experiences when they increased their excess.
[I] have in the past year doubled the size of their excess from $5,000 to $10,000. Taking up this feature saved me $400. — William from NSW
I negotiated a higher excess ($3,000 vs $1,000) to significantly reduce my premium. — Tom from Vic
If you struggle to manage or dispute costs on your own, you can engage either an insurance broker or approach an ombudsman via the Australian Financial Complaints Authority (AFCA) for some help in several areas, Mr Bird says.
An insurance broker provides advice tailored to your situation and can find out the best insurance options for you based on a thorough assessment of your needs.
Also acting as an advocate, they would also be able to undertake negotiations on your behalf.
Mr Bird says brokers can be very helpful in ""special circumstances"" such as if you are running a business from home or have a property larger than two hectares.
AFCA encourages you to take complaints to your insurer first and participate in their internal dispute processes before going to them for help.
It is important to note that AFCA will not consider complaints about premium increases unless it involves the following scenarios:
""Essentially, the insurer needs to be able to provide a valid reason for why they are increasing your premium by a certain amount,"" explains Mr Bird.
Here's how some readers have benefited from having third-party help.
I was shocked by the massive increase in my House and Contents insurance. I contacted my local Federal member of Parliament. He wrote to the CEO of this particular insurance company asking for a ""please explain!"" After the usual hoo-ha from the company, I did manage to get a 5 per cent discount off the premium … better than nothing I guess! — Bruce, NSW
My premium was up for renewal and I went online and completed an application. The premium jumped from $5,000 to $14,000 per year. I rang and said I had spoken to the Ombudsman and it was reduced to $6,000. — Lisa, QLD

We asked our readers to share their success stories in lowering their premiums, and had experts weigh in with their advice on the best strategies.
Here's what our brains trust had to say.
Home owners can decide whether to insure solely their property or extend their cover to include the loss of household items and belongings in the event of a mishap.
Taking out home insurance covers only damage to the property, whereas combined home and contents insurance factors in the value of material things inside the home that are damaged or lost, alongside the cost to rebuild.
If you're considering taking out insurance for your belongings for the first time, or you're reviewing existing cover, here are some important things to keep in mind.
CHOICE insurance expert Jodi Bird says it's important to distinguish the rebuilding costs from the actual market value of your home.
He suggests using an independent online calculator to help estimate costs and then comparing those to what's available on insurance provider websites.
That is why some readers actively stay across current costs that are involved with rebuilding when reviewing their policy covers.
Another way to lower your cost is each year or every two years at least check out how much coverage you really need for your contents cover. If you've got coverage of $100,000 for contents and you lose it and your contents are only worth $50,000, you will only be paid the replacement value of $50,000. Many people also forget insurance companies do not insure the land. They're only insuring the building on the land and you need to consider the building materials. — Jon, Vic
With the house & contents policy most insurers automatically put it up each year based on increased building costs, clean-up costs & other fees etc. But you can do your own checking to get an estimate rebuild figure. Sometimes what they say is the cost is higher than needed. I got them to leave it at the previous year's premium & I'll consider it again if needed at the next renewal. — Ian, Qld
Some readers were able to lower their premium payments after deciding they could do without certain coverage, something Mr Bird emphasises should be done with caution.
I have received a quote of about $700 lower than my current insurer on house and contents. New insurance does not cover flood. My council's flood certificate states no risk of flooding so worth the risk. — Suzanne, Qld
Shopped around to lower my apartment contents insurance and found a cheaper company. I rang to cancel my insurance with my existing provider, and they did a check. They asked if I needed flood insurance, I said no, and the price dropped dramatically. — David, NSW
In these instances, Mr Bird says it's important to be fully informed about the flood risk in your area.
One way to check this is to toggle on the flood premium option on your insurance provider's website.
If it reduces your payment, Mr Bird says, ""That's the insurer's way of saying they think there is a risk of flood where you are and that's something worth checking out with the local council.""
Sometimes, all it takes is a conversation with your insurance provider.
(Pexels: Anna Shvetsa)
At least, that was the case for these readers.
I managed to lower the premium just by negotiating. This has happened twice and I'm wondering whether there's not a set amount that the customer service people are permitted to offer. — Adam, Vic
Our premium went up by a few thousand. I called the insurer, and after a short, pleasant conversation the premium was dropped to slightly above the previous year. — Peter, NSW
Even if that means being transparent about your financial means.
I have rung the insurance provider, told them it's too expensive and asked them to make a better offer. This usually results in a reduction of $150-$250. — Rebecca, Tas
Henri from Queensland took a more proactive approach and provided his insurer with quotes from competitors that resulted in a price match.
We received our renewal invoice and it was $7,500. After comparing with two other insurance companies (with the same levels of cover and similar excess) and getting a far better quote (some $2,250 cheaper), I rang our insurance company and complained to them about the price. My call was escalated to a more senior person and they offered to match the lowest competitive price. We agreed and ended up saving approximately $2,250 — a great result. However, I'm unsure if it will happen this December when our insurance comes up for renewal again.
It's also worth checking against your existing provider in doing a price match, says Mr Bird.
""Pretend to be a new customer and see if you actually get a cheaper deal that way,"" he says.
If they offer a lower price, don't be afraid to contact your insurer and request them to match the better offer.
Hot tip: Use an incognito browser when accessing their website so you won't be identified as an existing customer.
Heard of the loyalty tax?
The motto ""persistence pays"" has come true for Henri van Riet who shaved off more than $2,500 by refusing to take no for an answer.
It's when insurers attract as many new customers as possible by offering hefty discounts up-front, which are later replaced with inflated premiums.
Being loyal to an insurer doesn't come with rewards, Financial Counselling Australia chief executive Peter Gartlan says.
He urges people to move around or negotiate for better deals.
ACT resident Belinda shared her experience with switching providers after decades of being a loyal customer.
The decision came with pleasant surprises.
I had been a loyal and constant customer with the same insurer for almost 20 years. In 2024, I had finally had enough of the insurance premiums going up and up while the insured value dropped. So, I contacted the company to have them reduce the premium by a small percentage. I then shopped around and got various quotes from other companies — I was shocked to see the premiums for identical options hundreds of dollars lower with multiple companies — up to $500 lower in the case of our house insurance. I have now moved each policy across to the new insurer as they were renewed. The new company also offered no fee pay by the month while the previous company charged you more to pay by the month.
And while switching providers may seem daunting at first, comparison websites can make the process easier.

Snow White is a great trailer for Disney's original animated masterpiece,By Luke Goodsell,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-21/snow-white-review-gal-gadot-rachel-zegler-disney/105060984,"Heigh-ho! Undeterred by cultural indifference, Disney's decade-long mission to remake their classic animation catalogue marches on.
And yes, after much delay, they've arrived at the fairest title of them all: the widely beloved Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
What: A live-action remake of Disney's classic animated feature, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Starring: Rachel Zegler, Gal Gadot, Andrew Burnap
Director: Marc Webb
When: In cinemas now
Likely to make you feel: Entertained — if you're in the single digits
Not only was that 1937 film the studio's very first feature, and the standard-setter for all that was to come but, adjusted for inflation, it remains the highest-grossing animated movie of all time — bigger than Frozen, bigger than The Lion King, more popular than anything Pixar ever produced.
That's a lot of pressure on this live-action remake, which is directed by Marc Webb (The Amazing Spider-Man; 500 Days of Summer) and stars Rachel Zegler and Gal Gadot as the feuding fairytale royals.
Like so many of the Mouse House's recent remakes, it's a no-win situation: stick too close to the original and it becomes a pointless retread; deviate from the classic text and risk incurring the wrath of everyone with an axe to grind.
In the case of the latter, the new movie already seemed doomed. Beyond the usual racist bores crying foul over the lead casting, there was Zegler's presumably disparaging comment about the cherished original, the matter of Gadot's hot-button political allegiance, and controversy over resurrecting a story that embraces outdated depictions of dwarfism. Talk about a magic mirror for the moment.
""I feel so lucky that I got to play something that is so far from what I know and what I'm used to, and I super, super enjoyed every second of it,"" Gal Gadot told Variety. (Supplied: Disney)
Of course, Disney's original feature took its own liberties with the Brothers Grimm fairytale on which it was based, so there's room for all kinds of retelling — the more radical, one might argue, the better.
Both an enhanced musical and a fleshed-out narrative, the 2025 version opens with more or less business as usual: having lost her royal parents, erstwhile princess Snow White (Zegler) has been relegated to palace servant under the tyranny of the vain Evil Queen (Gadot), who rules the once-utopian land with a bejewelled claw and sentient looking glass.
Prince Charming, the original Disney hunk, is nowhere to be found, however — or at least, he's been reconfigured as Jonathan (Andrew Burnap), a Robin Hood-like bandit who Snow White catches stealing potatoes in the royal scullery.
There's a flicker of, well — not exactly true love, but a shared interest in the redistribution of wealth. How romantic.

Once Snow White flees the Huntsman (Ansu Kabia) and stumbles upon the cottage of the seven — what should we call them, magic little men? — well, things start to get weird.
In Disney's typically disingenuous fashion, the movie never once mentions the D-word, but in every other respect Doc, Grumpy, Dopey and co. replicate the caricature appearance of their cartoon counterparts — only this time, using disconcerting CGI.
In place of simply using actors with real-life dwarfism, these photo-realistic digital creations are deeply unsettling, not unlike those real-life renderings of Simpsons characters. The whole thing is made even more odd by the fact that there are flesh-and-blood dwarf actors in the bandit crew.
""The filmmakers have taken such good care of this timeless classic,"" Zegler told The Movie Report. (Supplied: Disney)
Such hedging of bets is a familiar strategy of the Disney remake machine, eager to look progressive but wary of offending anyone. The result is a curiously benign film that isn't lacking for ideas, but whose execution is diluted — the bind of putting shareholders ahead of art.
Resurfaced comments made by actress Rachel Zegler about her upcoming film Snow White spark outrage online.
At the same time, there's plenty to admire here — and a younger audience, especially one unfamiliar with the many incarnations of the fable, will likely have a pretty good time.
Zegler, who broke through in Steven Spielberg's West Side Story and carried the surprisingly enjoyable reboot of the Hunger Games, brings a flinty exuberance to the title role, even as her theatre-kid vocals exist in another universe to the quaint music of the 1937 movie.
Her singing lights up the classic 'Whistle While You Work' and the newly created 'Waiting on a Wish', the latter one of the original songs by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul (2019's Aladdin). It's a standard, post-Wicked musical playbook, albeit with a couple of memorable additions. 'Princess Problems', a duet between Burnap and Zegler, generates Han and Leia sparks, while 'All is Fair' provides the Queen with a dastardly vamp — although let's just say that Gadot's singing gives her acting a run for its money.
The movie could probably do without the extra verses crow-barred into 'Heigh-Ho' — still one of the Mouse House's all-time bangers — or the antic rollercoaster sequence that accompanies it, which seems to exist as a not-too-subtle plug for a Disneyland ride. Less is more with the little guys, whose slapstick gets weary, and whose sentimentality is even worse.
Snow White is at its best when it manages to find its own groove, when it sticks to its revisionist guns and explores the relationship between its heroine — and her growing awareness of the Queen's injustice — and its scrappy hero.
Gal Gadot told Jimmy Fallon she was very nervous to say the iconic line: ""Magic mirror on the wall, who is the fairest of them all?"" (Supplied: Disney)
When the people's princess finally storms the palace with an army of peasants who look like they've migrated from a production of Les Mis, the movie achieves a kind of gravity and power, however redolent of #resist-era girl-bossing it may be.
Like most of the Disney remakes, though, nothing about this will be remembered a century — or even a year — from now, despite it being a perfectly serviceable movie on its own terms.
There are many reasons why the likes of the original Snow White, Pinocchio and Fantasia linger in the cultural memory, but one of them is that their magic — and their darkness — is impossible to replicate in today's filmmaking culture.

In place of simply using actors with real-life dwarfism, these photo-realistic digital creations are deeply unsettling, not unlike those real-life renderings of Simpsons characters. The whole thing is made even more odd by the fact that there are flesh-and-blood dwarf actors in the bandit crew.
""The filmmakers have taken such good care of this timeless classic,"" Zegler told The Movie Report. (Supplied: Disney)
Such hedging of bets is a familiar strategy of the Disney remake machine, eager to look progressive but wary of offending anyone. The result is a curiously benign film that isn't lacking for ideas, but whose execution is diluted — the bind of putting shareholders ahead of art.
Resurfaced comments made by actress Rachel Zegler about her upcoming film Snow White spark outrage online.
At the same time, there's plenty to admire here — and a younger audience, especially one unfamiliar with the many incarnations of the fable, will likely have a pretty good time.
Zegler, who broke through in Steven Spielberg's West Side Story and carried the surprisingly enjoyable reboot of the Hunger Games, brings a flinty exuberance to the title role, even as her theatre-kid vocals exist in another universe to the quaint music of the 1937 movie.
Her singing lights up the classic 'Whistle While You Work' and the newly created 'Waiting on a Wish', the latter one of the original songs by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul (2019's Aladdin). It's a standard, post-Wicked musical playbook, albeit with a couple of memorable additions. 'Princess Problems', a duet between Burnap and Zegler, generates Han and Leia sparks, while 'All is Fair' provides the Queen with a dastardly vamp — although let's just say that Gadot's singing gives her acting a run for its money.
The movie could probably do without the extra verses crow-barred into 'Heigh-Ho' — still one of the Mouse House's all-time bangers — or the antic rollercoaster sequence that accompanies it, which seems to exist as a not-too-subtle plug for a Disneyland ride. Less is more with the little guys, whose slapstick gets weary, and whose sentimentality is even worse.
Snow White is at its best when it manages to find its own groove, when it sticks to its revisionist guns and explores the relationship between its heroine — and her growing awareness of the Queen's injustice — and its scrappy hero.
Gal Gadot told Jimmy Fallon she was very nervous to say the iconic line: ""Magic mirror on the wall, who is the fairest of them all?"" (Supplied: Disney)
When the people's princess finally storms the palace with an army of peasants who look like they've migrated from a production of Les Mis, the movie achieves a kind of gravity and power, however redolent of #resist-era girl-bossing it may be.
Like most of the Disney remakes, though, nothing about this will be remembered a century — or even a year — from now, despite it being a perfectly serviceable movie on its own terms.
There are many reasons why the likes of the original Snow White, Pinocchio and Fantasia linger in the cultural memory, but one of them is that their magic — and their darkness — is impossible to replicate in today's filmmaking culture.
As ever, the new version makes a great trailer for the original.
Snow White is in cinemas now."

Ivey says the young Emmaleen is her most autobiographical character. (Supplied: Hachette Australia)
Look closely at the cover of Alaskan author Eowyn Ivey's latest novel and you'll discover the magic at its centre. The illustration shows a stand of dark trees with a bear standing beneath — a bear with the shadow of a man.
Our bear-man is Arthur, a quiet, reclusive man who — yes really — periodically transforms into a bear and goes wandering in the Alaskan woods. But Birdie, a single mum and waitress who falls in love with Arthur, doesn't know that.
Author Eowyn Ivey discusses her new book, Black Woods, Blue Sky, a magical tale set in the beautiful and rugged wilds of Alaska.
It all sounds a bit silly. But in Ivey's careful hands, this strange premise works. The author (whose previous novel, The Snow Child, introduced a similarly fanciful concept) keeps the story grounded in reality: Birdie is a flawed young mum who drinks too much and yearns for a simpler life, closer to nature. In Arthur, she finds a genuine connection and the chance for change.
Birdie's six-year-old daughter, Emmaleen, is wonderfully drawn — it's Emmaleen who learns Arthur's secret and realises the very real danger that mother and daughter face. And that sense of peril permeates the novel from the opening page.
Read it for the breathtaking Alaskan landscapes, read it for the heartbreaking mother-daughter story, or read it for the magic. But make sure you read it.

Brooks, who won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 2006, is the author of six novels and three works of non-fiction. (Hachette Australia)
It's May 2019 and Geraldine Brooks is blindsided by a phone call. Her husband, Tony Horwitz, also a writer, has died in the street — away from home, on a book tour, unexpectedly. Brooks is blindsided by grief and shock, of course, but also by the cruelty of the way she's told. The callous tiredness of the doctor who phones her, the lack of pause, the ways in which the system that held onto his body and processed the story allowed no compassion.
In the immediate aftermath, she had to act, alert their children, tell people, hurl herself onto a ferry from the island on which they lived, then onto a plane, away into the world of bureaucracy and organisation and information. All of this was brutal. All of it was hard. But she got on and she did it.
She was also finishing her sixth novel — Horse — and then travelling the world to talk about it, which she did with poise and reflection. One thing she wasn't able to do on that tour was talk about her husband. This was a private, howling grief.
Three years after his death, she realised she needed to return to that terrible day, to try to understand what had happened, both to him and to her. And she did this by taking herself to an island off the coast of Tasmania, a place of colonial heartbreak and pain, to find solitude and the space for memory — to tell a love story, to write a portrait, not just of the man she'd married, but what they were like together: an Australian and an American navigating the world and their own cultural differences; two foreign correspondents interested in world events; two writers who read each other's work and supported each other's ideas.
This book is the result: it's not just an elegy, it's also something else. An exploration and a reflection on grief; a portrait of love; a flinty facing-down of the hardest week. It's about mourning and memory, but it's not mournful. There's joy in it, as well as sorrow.

Disappoint Me is the second offering from Dinan, whose debut novel, Bellies, came out in 2023. (Supplied: Penguin Books Australia)
Disappoint Me is filled with beautifully flawed and fully realised characters.
It's about a romance between Max, a poet and lawyer who spends her days pretending to be an AI legal assistant bot for a tech company, and Vincent, a British-Chinese corporate lawyer who finds his joy in baking and playing clarinet.
Max is an unusual love interest in that she doesn't seem to have much interest in love. As she says in her apathetic and dry manner, ""I've lost many friends to heteronormativity in the last couple of years. Even queer ones."" Max sees Vincent's life, friends and even their relationship as almost alien displays of heteronormativity. As a trans woman she feels on the outside, with Vincent her only ticket in.
Despite this, Max and Vincent fall into easy harmony and closeness, seeking comfort in the surety of their love over the excitements of passion.
The story follows dual timelines, in present day with their burgeoning relationship, and in 2012 on Vincent's gap year in Thailand. A painful story of toxic masculinity unravels there that Vincent wants to keep from Max at all costs.
Dinan's prose is stark and delicate, sewing incisive comments on race, privilege, money, womanhood and trans identity between poignant takes on love and regret.
Disappoint Me is an immersive and sharp queer love story, published at a time when those are more important than ever.

Greenwell also writes criticism for The New Yorker and The Atlantic. (Supplied: Pan Macmillan Australia)
If the USA ever opts for free — or even affordable — health care, many writers will lose the plot. Literally: the plot of screenplays, where characters hustle or rob or con their way towards bill payment, will disappear; the plot of novels, where someone delays turning up at the Emergency Department because their ""insurance"" might not cover the cost of treatment. All gone.
Instead, in Garth Greenwell's latest novel, Small Rain, the unnamed 40-something narrator (a poet) is undone by sudden, inexplicable pain. It's the type of pain that respects no conventional scale, and he resists heading to the hospital for five days. His Spanish partner, a man referred to as L (also a poet) is confounded by this. The narrator turns his face away, looks inward, gasps, and tries to make sense of it through words and memories and story.
The latest and best fiction reviewed by a team of dedicated bibliophiles.
In the end, he makes it to a hospital, and discovers that yes, indeed, he might have died. He's too young for this, too loved for this, too full of words for this. And with beautiful acuity, he observes the people and systems and hierarchies around him — the small moments of kindness, as well as the indifferent cruelties; the fear embedded, not just in hospitals but in a world suddenly dealing with coronavirus as well; the frustrations and fear of a body newly unknown and unreliable.
This is a book that begins with a body in pain but moves through personal histories and sex, family stories and brutalities, art and poetry, romance and a house renovation.
It's also a novel at play with memoir and autofiction: it reads like ""real life"", but is labelled a novel. It shares details with both Greenwell's own life and the lives created in his earlier books (Cleanness, What Belongs to You). It also, surprisingly, shares a revealing moment of body shame and reflection with an Australian poet — hang on, isn't that X? — who is not named until you read the acknowledgements. So read on, read it all.

The first Asian woman to win the Nobel Prize in Literature — and one of its youngest recipients — Han Kang's latest novel explores the legacy of state-sanctioned violence that directly affected her parents' generation in Korea.
Kyungha is barely able to sleep or eat. Her pain isolates her. The line separating nightmare and reality has begun to blur.
She suffers anxiety. Everywhere she looks, bodies are fragile, death-stricken. She does not tell others about the visions she experiences. She fears they will not believe her. Even the autumn trees with their stripped bark resemble ""grey-white flesh stripped raw"".
Most of her time is spent writing ""a letter of farewell addressed to everyone"". Walking to the room where she writes, she imagines snipers on the rooftops, guns poised.
Hosts Kate Evans and Cassie McCullagh dissect Nobel Prize winner Han Kang's latest novel, We Do Not Part.
Gradually, we learn that the manuscript she is working on is connected to a real historical event. Beginning in late 1948, the Korean government suppressed a left-wing insurgency on Jeju, a volcanic island off the southern coast. Homes and lives were destroyed. Official estimates vary, but American allies were told the military and police killed around one-fifth of the island's population, or 60,000 people.
An unexpected message from a former coworker, Inseon, draws Kyungha out of isolation. Both Inseon's parents are survivors of the insurgency. Returning to the village to rebuild, her parents kept this violence hidden for the rest of their lives. When Inseon suffers a logging accident, she asks Kyungha to travel to the family home to care for two budgies left there. Kyungha's visit unearths secrets — and helps her begin to make sense of the pain she has been experiencing.
Picture a painting whose outlines are stark and whose colours are slowly filled in. That is how Kang writes. Like the gorgeously described snow throughout the book, this is a spare, haunting novel.
We Do Not Part is about how we must wait for years, even lifetimes, to hear the stories of people who have waited a lifetime to find the words for them.

You might assume that a novel about deradicalising ISIS brides would be serious or sombre. However, Nussaibah Younis's debut novel, Fundamentally, is silly, entertaining and deeply irreverent, translating a difficult topic into an easy read.
Protagonist Nadia's life in London is falling apart. Her girlfriend has left her, her mother ends each conversation by telling her she's going to hell and her relationship to religion is shot. Nadia makes the somewhat rash decision to move to Baghdad to run the controversial (and not particularly evidence-based), United Nations Deradicalisation Organisation — aptly titled UNDO.
Novels by Sally Rooney, Tim Winton and Booker Prize winner Samantha Harvey top our critics' favourite reads of the year.
As an expert in this field, Younis is perfectly situated to poke fun at the absurdity of humanitarian work and UN bureaucrats. We meet Pierre, the son of a French Tom, the head of security, an archetypal jock; and ""Sheikh Jason"" who prefers ""receiving energy from crystals"" over Islamic teaching.
Nadia is out of her depth. When she meets Sara, one of the women she is tasked with rehabilitating, she is transfixed. A gobby and rude East Londoner, Sara reminds Nadia of herself, forcing her to question her purpose at UNDO and whether she is just, as Sara calls her, ""a slag with a saviour complex"".
The writing is fun and conversational, and Younis depicts with honesty how difficult it is to find the moral ""right"" within the grey of conflict.

Probert seeks to learn how Roy from Wales became Bill from Kent in her family memoir. (Supplied: Upswell Publishing)
When Belinda Probert was growing up, her father never shared stories about his childhood. He attended King's College in London and served in the army in World War II — but Probert knew little else. Her father lived in the moment, travelling the globe as an executive for a multinational company and pursuing his passions for luxury cars and fly fishing in his spare time. He was sometimes beset by fits of rage when he drank too much but was otherwise a loving husband and father.
For Probert — a social scientist who was born in the UK but moved to Australia in 1976 — it never felt strange that her father didn't talk about his past. ""We probably assumed that his silence meant that Bill did not have any particularly interesting stories to tell,"" she writes in her latest book.
Author Belinda Probert discusses her search to uncover her father's secret past.
She learned just how misguided this assumption was when a letter arrived four months after Bill's death in 1994, revealing he was born to a large mining family in Wales and had disappeared at the end of World War II. It was a startling revelation to Bill's grieving widow, Janet, and his three children, who had no sense of his Welsh origins, particularly given his polished English accent.
Nearly 30 years later, Probert embarks on a mission to uncover the truth about her father. As she painstakingly pieces together his secret past, she sees Bill anew: as the son of a Welsh coal miner, a star student who became a gifted linguist, a war hero and perhaps a spy.
In her search for answers, Probert takes the reader along for the ride, documenting her amateur sleuthing and the roadblocks she encounters. Because this is real life, there is no neat resolution at the end. Most of the story's main players are dead, which means they can never answer questions about the past. Nor can Bill's family ever ask him why he hid his identity for so long. After surveying her father's fascinating life, Probert is left with more questions than answers — perhaps the most salient being, how well can we ever know our parents?

Ernaux's account of her love affair while undergoing cancer treatment was serialised in The New Yorker. (Supplied: Penguin Books Australia)
French author Annie Ernaux, another Nobel Prize in Literature winner, is known for her bracing examinations of sex and relationships, much of it semi-autobiographical.
Her latest is a little different: a collaborative memoir with Marc Marie, a photojournalist with whom she had an intense relationship in 2003. The book is interspersed with 14 pictures taken during their relationship, shown alongside meditations by each lover, detailing the emotional arc of their brief but forceful affair.
Ernaux asks the question that perhaps lies at the heart of all past relationships: what did it all mean?
Your favourite fiction authors share the story behind their latest books.
During the relationship, Ernaux is undergoing chemotherapy for breast cancer. The body becomes undeniable. She describes the photographs in ways that render them tactile, organic. They are, she says, like ""blood, semen and urine stains on sheets, or old mattresses, discarded on pavements […] the stains of wine or food embedded in the wood of sideboards, the stains of coffee or greasy fingers on old letters — the most material and organic kinds of stains.""
Ernaux takes the apparent stillness and solidity of each photograph as an invitation to reflect upon the hidden movements and life changes they secretly depict: a pair of boots lying far apart upon the floor reflects ""the force with which they were flung off"" before making love; a sheaf of scattered manuscript notes lying beside an office cord reminds her how passion let her forget, for a moment, her cancer.
The Use of Photography offers a challenge: if we cannot make sense of love and death, how do we at least think about them? Few acts put the present into focus like a love affair, particularly a short one.

The Use of Photography offers a challenge: if we cannot make sense of love and death, how do we at least think about them? Few acts put the present into focus like a love affair, particularly a short one.

Tune in to ABC Radio National at 10am Mondays for The Book Show and 10am Fridays for The Bookshelf.",426,4,"The pages of February's best books promise a lot: a queer love story full of incisive observation about life, a fiction-memoir blend about a body in love and in pain, and a character convinced they're being hunted by snipers. Two are the work of Nobel Prize winners while others are penned by debut authors.
One writer learns her father might've been a secret spy, another just where grief can take you. ABC Arts reviewers offer up all this and more in reading recommendations from this month.

Ivey says the young Emmaleen is her most autobiographical character. (Supplied: Hachette Australia)
Look closely at the cover of Alaskan author Eowyn Ivey's latest novel and you'll discover the magic at its centre. The illustration shows a stand of dark trees with a bear standing beneath — a bear with the shadow of a man.
Our bear-man is Arthur, a quiet, reclusive man who — yes really — periodically transforms into a bear and goes wandering in the Alaskan woods. But Birdie, a single mum and waitress who falls in love with Arthur, doesn't know that.
Author Eowyn Ivey discusses her new book, Black Woods, Blue Sky, a magical tale set in the beautiful and rugged wilds of Alaska.
It all sounds a bit silly. But in Ivey's careful hands, this strange premise works. The author (whose previous novel, The Snow Child, introduced a similarly fanciful concept) keeps the story grounded in reality: Birdie is a flawed young mum who drinks too much and yearns for a simpler life, closer to nature. In Arthur, she finds a genuine connection and the chance for change.
Birdie's six-year-old daughter, Emmaleen, is wonderfully drawn — it's Emmaleen who learns Arthur's secret and realises the very real danger that mother and daughter face. And that sense of peril permeates the novel from the opening page.
Read it for the breathtaking Alaskan landscapes, read it for the heartbreaking mother-daughter story, or read it for the magic. But make sure you read it.

Brooks, who won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 2006, is the author of six novels and three works of non-fiction. (Hachette Australia)
It's May 2019 and Geraldine Brooks is blindsided by a phone call. Her husband, Tony Horwitz, also a writer, has died in the street — away from home, on a book tour, unexpectedly. Brooks is blindsided by grief and shock, of course, but also by the cruelty of the way she's told. The callous tiredness of the doctor who phones her, the lack of pause, the ways in which the system that held onto his body and processed the story allowed no compassion.
In the immediate aftermath, she had to act, alert their children, tell people, hurl herself onto a ferry from the island on which they lived, then onto a plane, away into the world of bureaucracy and organisation and information. All of this was brutal. All of it was hard. But she got on and she did it.
She was also finishing her sixth novel — Horse — and then travelling the world to talk about it, which she did with poise and reflection. One thing she wasn't able to do on that tour was talk about her husband. This was a private, howling grief.
Three years after his death, she realised she needed to return to that terrible day, to try to understand what had happened, both to him and to her. And she did this by taking herself to an island off the coast of Tasmania, a place of colonial heartbreak and pain, to find solitude and the space for memory — to tell a love story, to write a portrait, not just of the man she'd married, but what they were like together: an Australian and an American navigating the world and their own cultural differences; two foreign correspondents interested in world events; two writers who read each other's work and supported each other's ideas.
This book is the result: it's not just an elegy, it's also something else. An exploration and a reflection on grief; a portrait of love; a flinty facing-down of the hardest week. It's about mourning and memory, but it's not mournful. There's joy in it, as well as sorrow.

Disappoint Me is the second offering from Dinan, whose debut novel, Bellies, came out in 2023. (Supplied: Penguin Books Australia)
Disappoint Me is filled with beautifully flawed and fully realised characters.
It's about a romance between Max, a poet and lawyer who spends her days pretending to be an AI legal assistant bot for a tech company, and Vincent, a British-Chinese corporate lawyer who finds his joy in baking and playing clarinet.
Max is an unusual love interest in that she doesn't seem to have much interest in love. As she says in her apathetic and dry manner, ""I've lost many friends to heteronormativity in the last couple of years. Even queer ones."" Max sees Vincent's life, friends and even their relationship as almost alien displays of heteronormativity. As a trans woman she feels on the outside, with Vincent her only ticket in.
Despite this, Max and Vincent fall into easy harmony and closeness, seeking comfort in the surety of their love over the excitements of passion.
The story follows dual timelines, in present day with their burgeoning relationship, and in 2012 on Vincent's gap year in Thailand. A painful story of toxic masculinity unravels there that Vincent wants to keep from Max at all costs.
Dinan's prose is stark and delicate, sewing incisive comments on race, privilege, money, womanhood and trans identity between poignant takes on love and regret.
Disappoint Me is an immersive and sharp queer love story, published at a time when those are more important than ever.

Greenwell also writes criticism for The New Yorker and The Atlantic. (Supplied: Pan Macmillan Australia)
If the USA ever opts for free — or even affordable — health care, many writers will lose the plot. Literally: the plot of screenplays, where characters hustle or rob or con their way towards bill payment, will disappear; the plot of novels, where someone delays turning up at the Emergency Department because their ""insurance"" might not cover the cost of treatment. All gone.
Instead, in Garth Greenwell's latest novel, Small Rain, the unnamed 40-something narrator (a poet) is undone by sudden, inexplicable pain. It's the type of pain that respects no conventional scale, and he resists heading to the hospital for five days. His Spanish partner, a man referred to as L (also a poet) is confounded by this. The narrator turns his face away, looks inward, gasps, and tries to make sense of it through words and memories and story.
The latest and best fiction reviewed by a team of dedicated bibliophiles.
In the end, he makes it to a hospital, and discovers that yes, indeed, he might have died. He's too young for this, too loved for this, too full of words for this. And with beautiful acuity, he observes the people and systems and hierarchies around him — the small moments of kindness, as well as the indifferent cruelties; the fear embedded, not just in hospitals but in a world suddenly dealing with coronavirus as well; the frustrations and fear of a body newly unknown and unreliable.
This is a book that begins with a body in pain but moves through personal histories and sex, family stories and brutalities, art and poetry, romance and a house renovation.
It's also a novel at play with memoir and autofiction: it reads like ""real life"", but is labelled a novel. It shares details with both Greenwell's own life and the lives created in his earlier books (Cleanness, What Belongs to You). It also, surprisingly, shares a revealing moment of body shame and reflection with an Australian poet — hang on, isn't that X? — who is not named until you read the acknowledgements. So read on, read it all.

The first Asian woman to win the Nobel Prize in Literature — and one of its youngest recipients — Han Kang's latest novel explores the legacy of state-sanctioned violence that directly affected her parents' generation in Korea.
Kyungha is barely able to sleep or eat. Her pain isolates her. The line separating nightmare and reality has begun to blur.
She suffers anxiety. Everywhere she looks, bodies are fragile, death-stricken. She does not tell others about the visions she experiences. She fears they will not believe her. Even the autumn trees with their stripped bark resemble ""grey-white flesh stripped raw"".
Most of her time is spent writing ""a letter of farewell addressed to everyone"". Walking to the room where she writes, she imagines snipers on the rooftops, guns poised.
Hosts Kate Evans and Cassie McCullagh dissect Nobel Prize winner Han Kang's latest novel, We Do Not Part.
Gradually, we learn that the manuscript she is working on is connected to a real historical event. Beginning in late 1948, the Korean government suppressed a left-wing insurgency on Jeju, a volcanic island off the southern coast. Homes and lives were destroyed. Official estimates vary, but American allies were told the military and police killed around one-fifth of the island's population, or 60,000 people.
An unexpected message from a former coworker, Inseon, draws Kyungha out of isolation. Both Inseon's parents are survivors of the insurgency. Returning to the village to rebuild, her parents kept this violence hidden for the rest of their lives. When Inseon suffers a logging accident, she asks Kyungha to travel to the family home to care for two budgies left there. Kyungha's visit unearths secrets — and helps her begin to make sense of the pain she has been experiencing.
Picture a painting whose outlines are stark and whose colours are slowly filled in. That is how Kang writes. Like the gorgeously described snow throughout the book, this is a spare, haunting novel.
We Do Not Part is about how we must wait for years, even lifetimes, to hear the stories of people who have waited a lifetime to find the words for them.

Younis is an expert on Iraq with a PhD in international affairs.  (Supplied: Hachette Australia)
You might assume that a novel about deradicalising ISIS brides would be serious or sombre. However, Nussaibah Younis's debut novel, Fundamentally, is silly, entertaining and deeply irreverent, translating a difficult topic into an easy read.
Protagonist Nadia's life in London is falling apart. Her girlfriend has left her, her mother ends each conversation by telling her she's going to hell and her relationship to religion is shot. Nadia makes the somewhat rash decision to move to Baghdad to run the controversial (and not particularly evidence-based), United Nations Deradicalisation Organisation — aptly titled UNDO.
Novels by Sally Rooney, Tim Winton and Booker Prize winner Samantha Harvey top our critics' favourite reads of the year.
As an expert in this field, Younis is perfectly situated to poke fun at the absurdity of humanitarian work and UN bureaucrats. We meet Pierre, the son of a French Tom, the head of security, an archetypal jock; and ""Sheikh Jason"" who prefers ""receiving energy from crystals"" over Islamic teaching.
Nadia is out of her depth. When she meets Sara, one of the women she is tasked with rehabilitating, she is transfixed. A gobby and rude East Londoner, Sara reminds Nadia of herself, forcing her to question her purpose at UNDO and whether she is just, as Sara calls her, ""a slag with a saviour complex"".
The writing is fun and conversational, and Younis depicts with honesty how difficult it is to find the moral ""right"" within the grey of conflict.

Probert seeks to learn how Roy from Wales became Bill from Kent in her family memoir. (Supplied: Upswell Publishing)
When Belinda Probert was growing up, her father never shared stories about his childhood. He attended King's College in London and served in the army in World War II — but Probert knew little else. Her father lived in the moment, travelling the globe as an executive for a multinational company and pursuing his passions for luxury cars and fly fishing in his spare time. He was sometimes beset by fits of rage when he drank too much but was otherwise a loving husband and father.
For Probert — a social scientist who was born in the UK but moved to Australia in 1976 — it never felt strange that her father didn't talk about his past. ""We probably assumed that his silence meant that Bill did not have any particularly interesting stories to tell,"" she writes in her latest book.
Author Belinda Probert discusses her search to uncover her father's secret past.
She learned just how misguided this assumption was when a letter arrived four months after Bill's death in 1994, revealing he was born to a large mining family in Wales and had disappeared at the end of World War II. It was a startling revelation to Bill's grieving widow, Janet, and his three children, who had no sense of his Welsh origins, particularly given his polished English accent.
Nearly 30 years later, Probert embarks on a mission to uncover the truth about her father. As she painstakingly pieces together his secret past, she sees Bill anew: as the son of a Welsh coal miner, a star student who became a gifted linguist, a war hero and perhaps a spy.
In her search for answers, Probert takes the reader along for the ride, documenting her amateur sleuthing and the roadblocks she encounters. Because this is real life, there is no neat resolution at the end. Most of the story's main players are dead, which means they can never answer questions about the past. Nor can Bill's family ever ask him why he hid his identity for so long. After surveying her father's fascinating life, Probert is left with more questions than answers — perhaps the most salient being, how well can we ever know our parents?

Ernaux's account of her love affair while undergoing cancer treatment was serialised in The New Yorker. (Supplied: Penguin Books Australia)
French author Annie Ernaux, another Nobel Prize in Literature winner, is known for her bracing examinations of sex and relationships, much of it semi-autobiographical.
Her latest is a little different: a collaborative memoir with Marc Marie, a photojournalist with whom she had an intense relationship in 2003. The book is interspersed with 14 pictures taken during their relationship, shown alongside meditations by each lover, detailing the emotional arc of their brief but forceful affair.
Ernaux asks the question that perhaps lies at the heart of all past relationships: what did it all mean?
Your favourite fiction authors share the story behind their latest books.
During the relationship, Ernaux is undergoing chemotherapy for breast cancer. The body becomes undeniable. She describes the photographs in ways that render them tactile, organic. They are, she says, like ""blood, semen and urine stains on sheets, or old mattresses, discarded on pavements […] the stains of wine or food embedded in the wood of sideboards, the stains of coffee or greasy fingers on old letters — the most material and organic kinds of stains.""
Ernaux takes the apparent stillness and solidity of each photograph as an invitation to reflect upon the hidden movements and life changes they secretly depict: a pair of boots lying far apart upon the floor reflects ""the force with which they were flung off"" before making love; a sheaf of scattered manuscript notes lying beside an office cord reminds her how passion let her forget, for a moment, her cancer.

They were on the hunt for ghost towns — a shared obsession — in places like the Sierra Nevada and Death Valley, when they made a pit stop in Yosemite National Park.
It was there Lukins befriended a rock climber with a hidden past.
""He was a self-professed dirtbag who lived out of the back of a van and lived for climbing rocks,"" Lukins tells ABC Radio National's The Book Show.
""One night, he let slip that he'd grown up in a family of billionaires, and he was from this very tiny, very strange town called Belle Haven in Connecticut.""

The rock climber — whose ultra-rich neighbours had included members of the Kennedy clan, Donald Trump and Diana Ross — said his hometown had a ""gurgling undercurrent of strangeness and drug addiction and scandal"".
Captivated by the tale, Lukins decided he had to see Belle Haven for himself and headed east. After following ""some sketchy directions"", he eventually arrived at its perimeter.
Undeterred by the imposing fences and patrolling security guards, Lukins slipped through a hedge into the gated community.

He was greeted by luxury on a scale he'd not before encountered.
""Every house was like a picture book version of a mansion; a great, glittering white edifice,"" he says.
He wandered along the streets until he came to the water, where, from over a nearby hedge, he could hear the ""thuck"" of a tennis ball being struck.
""Like a film, a tennis ball came arcing over the hedge, bounced in front of me and rolled in front of my feet. I picked it up, and stamped on it [was] 'Belle Haven Country Club' with a logo of a yacht sail,"" he recalls.
Lukins did just that. Somebody Down There Likes Me is his biting account of an ultra-rich family's fall from grace, and it's set in the 1990s in Belle Haven.

The four members of the Gulch family are an unlikeable bunch.
But Lukins isn't afraid to admit they are, actually, all drawn from his own character.

""She has a great sense of justice and injustice, but all she does with that is burn up inside,"" Lukins says.
Kick fails to turn her rage into action, a sin of which Lukins feels he is similarly culpable.
""She feels both furious and powerless but also guilty for not doing what she knows she should be doing,"" he says.
""This was a little bit of self-analysis … I make myself feel better by walking around thinking the right thoughts and feeling the right way about injustices in the world. But if I put myself under the microscope, I'm not doing nearly as much as I could.

Australia's Good Life Festival announces it is skipping 2025 edition due to rising costs,Jared Richards,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-19/good-life-australia-festival-cancelled-2025/105071776,"Good Life Presents is the latest Australian music festival to announce it will not return for 2025, citing ""rising operational and talent costs"".
Launched in 2010, Good Life is a multi-city day festival exclusively for teenagers. It has held more than 100 events nationally — most recently, last April's Lost City Festival in Brisbane and Sydney, headlined by US rapper Lil Pump and UK DJ Joel Corry. A 2025 event had not been announced.
In a social media statement shared on Wednesday, the festival — owned by Mushroom Group — reassured audiences that ""this isn't goodbye"", adding that it planned to return in 2026.
It continued: ""These challenges have made it unfeasible to deliver the world-class line-up and experience that Australian teens have come to expect.
Good Life has previously featured major international and Australian acts such as Avicii, The Kid LAROI, Lil Uzi Vert, Macklemore, Havana Brown, Rudimental, Skrillex and A$AP Rocky.
The cancellation is another blow to Australia's festival market, following the cancellation of large-scale events Splendour In The Grass and Groovin The Moo, both for the second year running.
In February, Souled Out cancelled a week before it was due to begin in Melbourne, the first of three events.
""Like many festivals in Australia, we have faced ongoing challenges in the current market,"" Souled Out's statement read.
Just over half of Australian music festivals are actually turning a profit, according to new research from Creative Australia.
Last year, arts investment and advisory body Creative Australia released a report into the music festival sector that found more than one-third of Australian music festivals were losing money as the sector faced increased operational costs.
The report found only 56 per cent of music festivals in 2022–23 were profitable and that young audiences between 18 and 24 years old were no longer the sector's primary market.
In March, a parliamentary inquiry into Australia's live music sector recommended a variety of ways to help the industry.

Usman Khawaja hits back at 'inflammatory' Queensland Cricket claims ahead of Sheffield Shield final,Star Cats recruit ruled out of Saints clash as Power thump Tigers,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-21/sheffield-shield-usman-khawaja-queensland-cricket/105080238,"Usman Khawaja has launched a passionate defence of his Sheffield Shield absence, slamming Queensland's head of cricket Joe Dawes for ""categorically untrue"" comments that left him ""fuming"".
A furore erupted when Dawes took aim at the Australia Test opener for sitting out the drawn match with South Australia in Adelaide that enabled the Bulls to qualify for the final.
Khawaja, set to be named in the Bulls' side for the Sheffield Shield final in Adelaide next week, called a media conference on Friday to offer an explanation.
He said a plan had been formulated with Cricket Australia (CA) medical staff and selector George Bailey to manage an ongoing hamstring complaint that he had played through in the previous round against Tasmania.
That match took place as Cyclone Alfred hit Brisbane. Khawaja left his young family to play and score a century despite batting in discomfort.
He said he had not spoken to Dawes — who said Khawaja had the all-clear from medical staff to play South Australia — in over a month.
""Joey said the medical staff had no idea: that is 100 per cent wrong,"" he said.
""I was talking to the Australian physio the whole time.
""Everyone knew about it … that was one of the most shocking things … categorically untrue.
""I don't do anything without talking to CA first. They always have final say.""
Khawaja said he had been in regular contact with Cricket Australia's medical staff. (ABC News: Curtis Rodda)
Khawaja said he had texted Bulls coach Johan Botha to inform him of his original plan that was based around not playing back-to-back fixtures but never got a reply.
He said it ""felt like it would pop"" in Tasmania, resorting to jogging while at the crease as the Bulls posted a vital nine-wicket win.
But at no stage was that management plan, or the injury, discussed with Botha or Queensland Cricket.
Khawaja, contracted to CA, considered the situation under control until speculation swirled last week.
The 38-year-old then attended Melbourne's Australian Grand Prix, mixing photos of his time on the grid with one of him doing hamstring rehabilitation on his social media account.
On the Bulls' return to Brisbane on Wednesday, Dawes claimed Khawaja was available for selection.
""I go off our medical staff and there is no reason why he could not have played the last game,"" Dawes said.
""It's just disappointing he didn't play a game for Queensland when he had an opportunity to.""

Khawaja said he had CA's blessing to attend the Grand Prix and was happy to mend his relationship with Dawes — a former Sheffield Shield-winning fast bowler for the Bulls — after next week's final.
""I go home and curl up in a ball, or I go and watch F1,"" Khawaja said.
""I still look after my body. It's not by any coincidence I'm 38 and still playing.
""The optics look bad … that's why I wanted to speak out.
""I still do love Queensland Cricket, no matter what happens.""
Khawaja has his sights set on continuing in Test cricket until the end of next summer's home Ashes series.
He captained the Bulls to their last Sheffield Shield title in 2020/21 when Australia teammate Marnus Labuschagne was player of the match with a brilliant 193 in an emphatic innings and 33-run defeat of NSW at Allan Border Field.
Labuschagne, who will captain the Bulls in the Shield final, was not concerned when he spoke earlier about the Khawaja situation.
He said the left-hander missing the match in Adelaide and being available for the final was in essence ""the perfect result"".
""We understand if we want the best out of him he's going to need to make sure he's ready to go and fresh so he doesn't get himself injured,"" Labuschagne said.

Players' group founded by Novak Djokovic files antitrust suit against tennis organisers,independent players' union co-founded by Novak Djokovic in 2019,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-19/novak-djokovic-tennis-group-sues-governing-bodies/105069284,"The Professional Tennis Players' Association (PTPA) has filed a lawsuit against the sport's governing bodies, accusing them of anti-competitive practices and a disregard for player welfare.
The PTPA, an independent players' union co-founded by Novak Djokovic in 2019, said on Tuesday that after years of good-faith efforts to reform professional tennis, it had been forced to take legal action to end ""monopolistic control"" of the sport.
In a statement, it said that along with more than a dozen players, the PTPA had filed papers in a New York court against the ATP Tour, the WTA Tour, the International Tennis Federation (ITF) and the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA).
Among those players with their names attached to the lawsuit is Nick Kyrgios, as well as Romania's Sorana Cîrstea, Russia-born French player Varvara Gracheva and Americans Reilly Opelka, Tennys Sandgren and Nicole Melichar-Martinez.
Djokovic is not named in the lawsuit.
PTPA executive director Ahmad Nassar said Djokovic was ""certainly very involved, very up to speed. He is still a sitting member of our executive committee at the PTPA … This is about much more than one player"".

""Beyond just the economics, we see … player welfare is completely disregarded in everything, from the tour schedule to anti-competitive practices, to abusing our rights around name, image, likeness,"" co-founder of the PTPA Vasek Pospisil, who is also listed as a plaintiff, said.
""Tennis is broken,"" Nassar said in a statement.
""Behind the glamorous veneer that the defendants promote, players are trapped in an unfair system that exploits their talent, suppresses their earnings and jeopardises their health and safety.
Tennis players are playing more often, in more locations around the world than ever before. This ""ridiculous"" schedule is looming as the sport's biggest threat.
""We have exhausted all options for reform through dialogue, and the governing bodies have left us no choice but to seek accountability through the courts. Fixing these systemic failures isn't about disrupting tennis, it's about saving it for the generations of players and fans to come.""
In response, the ATP accused the PTPA of choosing ""division and distraction"" and having no meaningful role in the sport.
""We strongly reject the premise of the PTPA's claims, believe the case to be entirely without merit, and will vigorously defend our position,"" the ATP said in a statement.
""ATP remains committed to working in the best interests of the game — towards continued growth, financial stability and the best possible future for players, tournaments, and fans.""
The WTA defended its record of growing women's tennis, describing the lawsuit as ""baseless"".
""Every decision taken at the WTA board level includes the input of players via their elected board representatives, and athletes receive substantial financial rewards and other benefits from participation in the WTA,"" the organisation said.

""Behind the glamorous veneer that the defendants promote, players are trapped in an unfair system that exploits their talent, suppresses their earnings and jeopardises their health and safety.
Tennis players are playing more often, in more locations around the world than ever before. This ""ridiculous"" schedule is looming as the sport's biggest threat.
""We have exhausted all options for reform through dialogue, and the governing bodies have left us no choice but to seek accountability through the courts. Fixing these systemic failures isn't about disrupting tennis, it's about saving it for the generations of players and fans to come.""
In response, the ATP accused the PTPA of choosing ""division and distraction"" and having no meaningful role in the sport.
""We strongly reject the premise of the PTPA's claims, believe the case to be entirely without merit, and will vigorously defend our position,"" the ATP said in a statement.
""ATP remains committed to working in the best interests of the game — towards continued growth, financial stability and the best possible future for players, tournaments, and fans.""
The WTA defended its record of growing women's tennis, describing the lawsuit as ""baseless"".
""Every decision taken at the WTA board level includes the input of players via their elected board representatives, and athletes receive substantial financial rewards and other benefits from participation in the WTA,"" the organisation said.

Describing the various governing bodies as ""a cartel"", the PTPA, which has also begun legal action in Britain and the EU, accuses them of paying ""artificially low compensation to professional tennis players"" and imposing a ""draconian"" ranking system that forces them to compete in certain tournaments.
The lawsuit calls the schedule unsustainable, says players are made to play in extreme heat and often in the early hours of the morning, that tennis balls chosen by the tournaments are a factor in chronic injuries and that players' privacy rights are being abused by random drug tests.

Prior to filing the lawsuit, the PTPA said it met with more than 250 players across the tours, including the majority of the men's and women's top 20.
""The overwhelmingly positive player feedback was a resounding confirmation — change is needed now, and players are united in their fight for reform,"" the statement said.
Serbia's 24-time grand slam champion Djokovic has been a fierce advocate for change to the organisation of tennis, insisting that the revenues generated by the sport were not fairly shared with players.
""Women and men who are around 200 and lower-ranked in the world, they are struggling a lot,"" he said in a CBS 60 Minutes interview in 2023.
""They can't afford a coach, they can't afford travels, they skip tournaments, many of them leave tennis who are super talented and maybe capable of reaching great heights.""
The ITIA, which manages the sport's anti-doping and anti-corruption programmes, responded, saying: ""Any credible international sport requires robust anti-doping and anti-corruption programmes, and we are proud of our role in contributing to a clean and fair sport.""

US boxer and businessman George Foreman dies aged 76,Star Cats recruit ruled out of Saints clash as Power thump Tigers,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-22/george-foreman-us-boxer-dies-aged-76/105084628,"US heavyweight boxing champion and businessman George Foreman has died aged 76, according to a statement from his family.
Foreman passed away on Friday local time, his family announced on Instagram.
""A humanitarian, an Olympian, and two time heavyweight champion of the world,"" the statement read.
He was deeply respected — a force for good, a man of discipline, conviction, and a protector of his legacy, fighting tirelessly to preserve his good name — for his family.
""We are grateful for the outpouring of love and prayers, and kindly ask for privacy as we honor the extraordinary life of a man we were blessed to call our own.""
Foreman won the world heavyweight title after beating the then-undefeated Joe Frazier in 1973.
He defended the belt twice before suffering his first professional loss to Muhammad Ali in the famous Rumble in the Jungle in 1974.
Two decades later, ""Big George"" knocked out Michael Moorer to claim his second crown.

Foreman's comeback and the fortune he made selling fat-wicking electric cooking grills made him an icon of self-improvement and success for the Baby Boomer generation.
Born in 1949, the boxer grew up poor in the segregated American South, before dropping out of junior high school and using his size and fists in street robberies.
He would later write he was ""rescued"" from ""the gutter"" by the the Job Corps, part of US president Lyndon B Johnson's ""Great Society"" reforms.
Through the program, 16-year-old Foreman moved out of Texas and was encouraged to channel his rage and growing bulk into boxing.
At age 19 and in his 25th amateur fight, Foreman captured the heavyweight boxing gold medal at the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City.
Turning pro, he won 37 straight matches on his way to face reigning champion Frazier in Kingston, Jamaica, winning by technical knockout in round two.

Foreman defended the belt twice more before meeting Ali in Kinshasa, Zaire, now the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in one of the most celebrated boxing matches in history.
Ali had been stripped of his crown seven years prior for refusing to be drafted into the Vietnam War and be came into the match a heavy underdog against the bigger, younger champion.
But for seven rounds, Ali lay against the ropes and fended off Foreman's clubbing blows, tiring and knocking him out in the eighth round.
""I was one strong heavyweight punching fighter,"" Foreman told Reuters in 2007.
The loss devastated Foreman.
He took a year off before returning to the ring and then, after a second professional loss, retired in 1977 to become an ordained minister in the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ.
A decade later and considerably heavier at 143 kilograms, Foreman staged an unlikely return to the ring to raise money for a youth centre he founded in Texas.
He went on to win 24 straight matches, gradually slimming down along the way, before losing to Evander Holyfield in a 12-round decision in 1991.
Three years later, he knocked out undefeated southpaw Moorer to become the oldest-ever heavyweight champion at age 45.
Foreman's last match was in 1997 and he ended his career with a professional record of 76 wins and five losses.
Foreman was married four times in the 1970s and 1980s.
In 1985, he married for the fifth time to Mary Joan Martelly, who he remained with for the rest of his life.
He had five sons — all called George — five biological daughters, and two adopted daughters.
Throughout the 1990s and after retirement, he was an enthusiastic pitchman for various products, most notably an electric grill from home appliance maker Salton Inc.
In 1999, the company paid Foreman and his partners $US137.5 million ($219.19 million) to put his name on the grill and other goods.
""What I do is fall in love with every product I sell,"" Foreman wrote in his autobiography By George.

Jacinta Allan grilled on how much taxpayers forked out to bring the NFL to Melbourne amid Victoria's soaring debt,Bryant Hevesi,https://www.skynews.com.au/australia-news/politics/jacinta-allan-grilled-on-how-much-taxpayers-forked-out-to-bring-the-nfl-to-melbourne-amid-victorias-soaring-debt/news-story/18d52e5ae9c603bae0502297d04717f3,"Jacinta Allan has been grilled on how much taxpayers forked out to secure NFL matches in Melbourne and whether Victoria can even afford to pay to have games of American football amid the state's soaring debt.
The Victorian Premier confirmed on Thursday the NFL was headed to the Melbourne Cricket Ground in an Australian first but fumbled the announcement in an interview with Nova Melbourne breakfast show Jase and Lauren.
Asked to confirm long-standing rumours of the NFL coming to Melbourne for a ""Nova exclusive"", the state Labor leader initially confused rugby league with American football.
""You are bang on. This is a touchdown for Melbourne and Victoria, the NRL,"" Ms Allan said before quickly correcting herself and saying ""the NFL"" multiple times.
The faux pas prompted show co-host Lauren Phillips to cheekily quip: ""Oh no, you're having a shocker this morning"".
The government managed to ""secure a multi-year deal for Melbourne tohost NFL regular season games"", with the first match to take place in 2026 with the Los Angeles Rams locked-in as the ""home"" team.
Their opponents are not yet known nor is the date of the match, although there is a possibility it will happen in September 2026 given that is the month the NFL season starts, which could potentially clash with AFL games.
During a press conference, Ms Allan cited ""commercial in confidence"" in declining to reveal what the government offered to bring the NFL to Melbourne.
""Consistent with other arrangements for big important events like this, these arrangements are commercial in confidence because this is about making sure that we retain our competitive edge in securing big and important events like this one,"" she said.
Ms Allan also brushed aside concerns about Victoria's financial capacity to secure the spectacle, with the state's net debt on track to hit a whopping $187.3 billion in 2027-28.
""This is absolutely going to support our strong economy here in Victoria. Major events like this one support jobs and that's why we're backing them,"" she said.
""Everyone is a winner from this because it's about bringing visitors to Melbourne. It's about showcasing Melbourne to the world. And don't underestimate how many people go, I'm going to go and visit Melbourne.
""The visitor economy – sporting events, major events, the cultural events – that contributes billions and billions and billions to our economy every single year.""
Financial concerns were the major factor in Victoria pulling out of hosting the 2026 Commonwealth Games planned for Geelong, Bendigo, Shepparton, Ballarat and Gippsland.
In July 2023, then premier Daniel Andrews pulled the pin on the games claiming costs had blown out to between $6 and $7 billion, well above the $2.6 billion which had been allocated in the budget, and that was ""well and truly too much for a 12 day sporting event"".
Ms Allan - who had served as Commonwealth Games delivery minister - said on Thursday her government was determined to fight to bring major events to Victoria.
""The announcement... here today was made possible because a group of people who lead organisations, as premier, visit Victoria, the MCC… we knew that this was going to be fabulous for our city and state. And we worked together and we're on team Victoria,"" she said.
""And I make that very clear – that we will fight for Victorians.

NRL exploring Grand Final idea to increase American interest as game prepares to take on Vegas for second year in a row,Patrick Staveley,https://www.skynews.com.au/australia-news/sport/nrl-exploring-grand-final-idea-to-increase-american-interest-as-game-prepares-to-take-on-vegas-for-second-year-in-a-row/news-story/1f7593441f2b4d7131977485bdacdacf,"The NRL is exploring another ambitious option to sell rugby league to Americans, on the eve of a blockbuster day for the game in Las Vegas.
Fans have turned out in full force in Sin City over the past week during an NRL takeover ahead of a massive day at Allegiant Stadium on Saturday, US time (Sunday AEDT).
Four matches will take place at Allegiant Stadium, the same ground that hosted the NFL Super Bowl just last month, including the NRL curtain-raisers - Canberra Raiders vs New Zealand Warriors and Penrith Panthers vs Cronulla Sharks.
While the week has looked like another burgeoning success, the NRL is always alert to new ideas that could continue to take the game forward and sell it outside of Australia.
Warriors chief executive Cameron George suggested the idea of having the NRL Grand Final this year broadcast from the highly popular Sphere in Vegas.
""There’s an opportunity to have an office and presence here to continually work on the ground corporately, commercially, building a fan base and promoting the game,"" he said.
“I don’t know what the cost would be, but something like showing our grand final live into the sphere could be an amazing experience for the game.
“It would build our fan base over here and they could enjoy it as a wonderful introduction to some of the biggest games on the calendar.”
NRL chief executive Andrew Abdo said the idea was ""interesting"" and worth exploring.
“Any way in which we can promote the game in the US into new markets will be looked at,” he said.
The Sphere was opened in September 2023, and has a capacity of 17,600 seated. The $2.3 billion USD venue has quickly become one of the top attractions in the city.
The NRL is hoping for upwards of 50,000 fans to walk through the gates of Allegiant Stadium on Saturday.
Last year the overall number fell just short of 40,000.
All matches will be broadcast on Kayo and Foxtel.
